One of the interesting ways of settling the race problem comes to the
fore in this period of unemployment among the poor. In Waterloo, Ky.,
the enterprising chief of police is arresting all unemployed Negroes and
putting them in jail, thus securing their labor for the state at the
cheapest possible figure. This bright idea did not originate in
Kentucky. It is used all through the South and strong sermons and
editorials are written against "lazy" Negroes.

Despite this there are people in this country who wonder at the increase
of "crime" among colored people.
