<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">O mist-blown Lily of the north,
<p class = "verse">A-bending southward in thy bloom,
<p class = "verse">And bringing beauty silver sown
<p class = "verse">And pale blue radiance of snows&mdash;
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">O fair white ily, bowing low,
<p class = "verse">Above the dream-swept poppy&rsquo;s mouth,
<p class = "verse">Athwart the black and crimson South&mdash;
<p class = "verse">Why dost thou fear&mdash;why dos thou fear?
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Lo! sense its sleep-sown subtle breath,
<p class = "verse">Where wheel in passioned whirl above
<p class = "verse">All lingering, luring love of love&mdash;
<p class = "verse">All perfume born of dole and death.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Cold ghost-wreathed Lily of the North,
<p class = "verse">When once thy dawning darkens there,
<p class = "verse">Come then with sunlight-sifted hair
<p class = "verse">And seek the haunting heaven of Night.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Where, over moon-mad shadows whirled,
<p class = "verse">The star-tanned mists dim swathe the sky
<p class = "verse">In phantasy to dream and die&mdash;
<p class = "verse">A wild sweet wedding of the World.
</div>
