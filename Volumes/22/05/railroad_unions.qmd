In the fight against predatory capital the railroad unions richly deserve defeat. They have been head and foot of a contemptible monopoly of labor, and by the open exclusion of Negroes, of Italians, of Jews and of any weak or disadvantaged group, they have deliberately and ruthlessly built up their own high wages and exclusive privileges, on the starvation, unemployment, sickness and destitution of the common laborer. They deserve defeat. They deserve to have their unions smashed. They cannot look for votes or sympathy from the mass of the laboring whites, and especially the blacks.
