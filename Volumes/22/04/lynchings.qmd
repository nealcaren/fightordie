You are frightened? Thieves, hold-ups and crime? But the police and the courts are with you. Public opinion is behind you; your neighbor's arm is ready to help.

How would you feel if you were a Negro and lived in Georgia or Mississippi or Oklahoma?

There the police *is* the mob. 

The courts *are* the lynchers. 

The press will lie to the last ditch to distort the truth. Suppose you lived there and heard a noise in the night?
