There seems to be no doubt but that the attempt to draw the color line in the woman's suffrage movement has received a severe and, let us hope, final setback. Both at Washington and St. Louis the right of the black woman to vote and strive for a vote was openly recognized. There was, to be sure, a struggle in both cases and the forces of caste are not demoralized; they are, however, beaten at present, and a great and good cause can go forward with unbedraggled skirts. Let every black man and woman fight for the new democracy which knows no race or sex.
