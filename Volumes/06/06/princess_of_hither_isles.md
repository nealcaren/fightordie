# The Princess of the Hither Isles (1913)

Her soul was very beautiful, wherefore she kept it veiled in lightly
laced Humility, and Fear, out of which peered anxiously ever and anon
the white and blue and pale gold of her face --- beautiful as daybreak or
as the laughing of a child. She sat in the Hither Isles, well walled
between the This and Now, upon a low and silver throne and leaned upon
its armposts sadly looking upward toward the sun. Now the Hither Isles
are flat and cold and swampy, with drear drab light and all manner of
slimy, creeping things, and piles of dirt and clouds of flying dust and
sordid scraping and feeding and noise.

She hated them; and ever as her hands and busy feet swept back the dust
and slime, her soul sat silent, silver throned, staring toward the great
hill to westward, which shone so brilliant golden beneath the sunlight
and above the sea.

The sea moaned and with it moaned the Princess' soul, for she was
lonely; very, very lonely, and full weary of the monotone of life. So
she was glad to see a moving in Yonder Kingdom on the mountain side
where the sun shone warm, and when the King of Yonder Kingdom, silken in
robe and golden crowned, warded by his hound, walked down along the
restless waters and sat beside the armpost of her throne, she wondered
why she could not love him and fly with him up the shining mountain's side out of the dirt and dust that nested between This and Now.
She looked at him and tried to be glad, for he was bonny and good to
look upon, this King of Yonder Kingdom: tall and straight, thin lipped
and white and tawny. So again this last day she strove to burn life into
his singularly sodden clay --- to put his icy soul aflame wherewith to
warm her own, to set his senses singing. Vacantly he heard her winged
words, staring and curling his long mustaches with vast thoughtfulness.
Then he said:

"We've found more gold in Yonder Kingdom. "

"Hell seize your gold!" blurted the Princess.

"No --- it's mine," he maintained stolidly.

She raised her eyes. "It belongs," she said, "to the Empire of the
Sun."

"Nay --- the sun belongs to us," said the King calmly, as he glanced to
where Yonder Kingdom blushed above the sea. She glanced, too, and a
softness crept into her eyes.

"No, no," she murmured, as with hesitating pause she raised her eyes
above the sea, above the hill, up into the sky where the sun hung
silent, splendid. Its robes were heaven's blue, lined and broidered in
living flame, and its crown was one vast jewel glistening in glittering
glorv that made, the sun's own face a blackness --- the blackness of utter
light. With blinded, tear-filled eyes she peered into that formless
black and burning face and sensed in its soft,
sad gleam unfathomed understanding. With sudden wild abandon she
stretched her arms toward it appealing, beseeching, entreating, and lo!

"Niggers and dagoes," said the King of Yonder Kingdom, glancing
carelessly backward and lighting in his lips a carefully rolled wisp of
fragrant tobacco. She looked back, too, but in halfwondering terror, for
it seemed ---

A Beggar man was creeping across the swamp, shuffling through the dirt
and slime. He was little and bald and black, rough clothed, sooted with
dirt and bent with toil. Yet withal something she sensed about him, and
it seemed ---

The King of Yonder Kingdom lounged more comfortably beside the silver
throne and let curl a tiny trail of light blue smoke.

"I hate Beggars," he said, "especially brown and black ones."
And he then pointed at the Beggar's retinue and laughed --- an unpleasant
laugh welded of contempt and amusement. The Princess looked and shrank
on her throne. He the Beggar man was --- was what? But his retinue, that
squalid, sordid particolored band of vacant, dull-faced filth and
viciousness, was writhing over the land, and he and they seemed almost
crouching underneath the scorpion lash of one tall skeleton that looked
like Death, and the twisted woman whom men call Pain. Yet they all
walked as One.

The King of Yonder Kingdom laughed, but the Princess shrank on her
throne and the King seeing her took a gold piece from out his purse and
tossed it carelessly to the passing throng. She watched it with
fascinated eyes---how it rose and sailed and whirled and struggled in
the air; then seemed to burst, and upward flew its sunlight and its
sheen and downward dropped its dross. She glanced at the King, but he
was lighting a match. She watched the dross wallow in the slime, but the
sunlight fell on the back of the Beggar's neck and he turned his head.

The Beggar, passing afar, turned his head, and the Princess straightened
on her throne; he turned his head, and she shivered forward on her
silver seat; he looked upon her full and slow and suddenly she saw
within that formless black and burning face the same soft, sad gleam of
utter understanding seen so many times before. She saw the suffering of
endless years and endless love that softened it. She saw the burning
passion of the sun and with it the cold unbending duty-deeds of upper
air. All she had seen and dreamed of seeing in the rising, blazing sun
she saw now again, and with it myriads more of human tenderness, of
longing and of love. So then she knew. So then she rose as to a dream
come true with solemn face and waiting eyes.

With her rose the King of Yonder Kingdom, almost eagerly.

"You'll come?" he cried. "You'll come and see my gold?" And then in
sudden generosity he added: "You'll
have a golden throne---up there, when we marry."

But she, looking up and on with radiant face, answered softly: "I
come."

So down and up and on they mounted; the black Beggar and his cavalcade
of Death and Pain, and then a space; and then a lone black hound that
nosed and whimpered as he ran, and then a space; and then the King of
Yonder Kingdom in his robes, and then a space; and last the Princess of
the Hither Isles, with face set sunward and lovelight in her eyes.

And so they marched and struggled on and up through endless years and
spaces, and ever the black Beggar looked back past Death and Pain toward
the maid, and ever the maid strove forward with lovelit eyes, but ever
the great and silken shoulders of the King of Yonder Kingdom rose
between the Princess and the sun like a cloud of storms.

Now finally they neared unto the hillside's topmost shoulder, and there
most eagerly the King bent to the bowels of the earth and bared its golden entrails --- all green and gray and rusted --- while the Princess strained her pitiful eyes aloft to where the Beggar, set 
'twixt Death and Pain, whirled his slim back against the glory of the setting sun and stood, sombre in his grave majesty, enhaloed and transfigured, outstretching his long arms; and, around all Heaven, glittered jewels in a cloth of gold. 

A while the Princess stood and moaned in mad amaze, then with one wilful wrench she bared the white flowers of her breast and snatching forth her own red heart held it with one hand aloft while with the other she gathered close her robe and poised herself. 

The King of Yonder Kingdom looked upward quickly, curiously, still fingering the earth, and saw the offer of her bleeding heart. 

"It's a Nigger," he growled darkly; "it may not be." 

The woman quivered. 

"It's a Nigger," he repeated fiercely. "It's neither God nor Man. but a Nigger." 

The Princess stepped forward. 

The King grasped his great sword and looked north and east; he raised his long sword and looked south and west. 

"I seek the sun," the Princess sang, and started into the west. 

"Never!" cried the King of Yonder Kingdom, "for such were blasphemy and defilement and the making of all evil." 

So raising his great sword he struck with all his might and more. Down hissed the blow and bit that little white heart-holding hand till it flew armless and disbodied up through the sunlit air. Down hissed the blow and clove the whimpering hound till his last shriek shook the stars. Down hissed the blow and rent the earth. It trembled, fell apart and yawned to a chasm wide as earth from Heaven, deep as hell, and empty, cold and silent. 

On yonder distant shore blazed the mighty Empire of the Sun in warm and 
blissful radiance; while on this side, in shadows cold and dark, gloomed
the Hither Isles and the hill that once was golden but now was green and
slimy dross; all below was the sad and moaning sea, while between the
Here and There flew the severed hand and dripped the bleeding heart.

Then up from the soul of the Princess welled a cry of dark
Despair --- such cry as only babe-raped mothers know, and murdered loves.
Poised on the crumbling edge of that great nothingness the Princess
hung, hungering with her eyes and straining her fainting ears against
the awful splendor of the sky.

Out from the slime and shadows groped the King, thundering; "Back ---
don't be a fool!"

But down through the thin ether thrilled the still and throbbing warmth
of heaven's sun whispering "Leap!"

And the Princess leapt.
