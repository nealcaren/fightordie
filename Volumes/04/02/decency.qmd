By a vote of 203 against 133, the German Reichstag has declared that
marriages between Germans and native women in the colonies are legal.
This is a triumph of sheer decency. It does not compel any German to
marry a black or a brown woman. If Germans do not want a mixed mulatto
progeny they may let the native woman alone. The law simply says that a
marriage in fact is a marriage in law; that the virtue of a colored
woman in the German colonies is to receive legal protection.

The simplest and barest demand of even half-civilized justice was not
easily carried. It took the strength of Socialists and Catholics,
fighting against the strongholds of German culture---the liberals and
the aristocracy. Here were found the upholders of the dirtiest blot of
modern white contact with backward races---the blot which makes the
white Christian Church of the South to-day the strongest upholder of the
system which denies all protection in law and custom to the helpless
black girl before the lust of the white man.
