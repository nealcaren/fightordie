As the colored people become more and more a self-conscious,
selfdirecting group, with organs of intelligence and moving
representatives, it is becoming difficult to deceive them as to men and
movements. On the other hand, there is still opportunity for unscrupulous colored men to play on the ignorance of the white world as
to what is going on in the colored group. If a man announces himself to
be of a certain position in the white world, he is immediately looked up
carefully. But the colored impostor is taken on blind faith and his lies
and peculations when discovered are credited to the whole black race. In
Atlanta there is a colored preacher who is making a living and some
notoriety by vilifying his people; he has been repudiated by his own
church and school, but has an institution of his own which he is
promoting. His latest bid for white Southern support is this:

> Our training in the college, university and grammar school has been
t,oo much of the theoretical, showy kind, more for name than reality.
How many of our boys and girls, who are said to be well educated, are
almost helpless for the reason that they can do nothing that really pays
or that somebody wants done. This is illustrated by the large army to be
seen at our depots, pool-rooms and street corners in the red-light
districts of the communities and cities where we are so largely
congested.

This is a contemptible lie. The graduates of Southern Negro schools and
colleges are not loafing in the "red-light" districts and this man
knows it. But what difference does that make so long as the white world
of Atlanta praises him, uses his words to traduce and cripple worthy
colored schools, and gives him letters with which to raise money from
gullible Northerners for an institution that exists chiefly on paper?

Another method of deception has been discovered in promoting
conventions. There is a National Association of Teachers in colored
schools, which is now nine years old. Seeing its success, some colored
men in Kansas City have been promoting in the last two years a "Negro
National Educational Congress." They have advertised widely, induced governors to appoint "delegates" and sought to make it appear
that they had the support of some body of worthy teachers.

In fact they are nothing but a private set of promoters, many of whom
are said to be of doubtful reputation, and not one of them of any
considerable standing in the colored educational world. Their
"convention" at Denver last year barely missed being a fiasco, and we
trust that the worthy colored citizens of St. Paul will see to it that
this "convention" does not parade in that city under false colors, and
bring ten million people into contempt.
