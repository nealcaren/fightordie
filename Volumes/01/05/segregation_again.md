# Segregation Again (1911)

The Baltimore segregation ordinance continues to bring out comment. When it was pronounced void, on account of technical defects, the New York *Evening Post* said: "It is interesting to note that while the judges rendered their decision on the ground of improper framing of the ordinance, they took occasion, in handing down the decision, to touch upon the real issue involved, as follows: 

> "Whether it is possible to pass a valid ordinance providing for the segregation of the white and colored races in their places of residence, is a question of great importance, but is one which in our judgment ought to be decided when an ordinance not otherwise void is before this court.    
> &nbsp;    
> "It happens that of the two judges sitting in the case one is a Democrat and the other a Republican, but there is apparently no difference of opinion between them as to the grave doubt that attaches to the question whether it would be possible constitutionally to effect the object arrived at by any device whatsoever." 

Harper's Weekly observes: "Baltimore may be the first large community to attempt to legalize a discrimination against Negroes in the matter of where they shall be permitted to live and to hold property, but a similar discrimination, enforced by means as effective as any written law, is common to nearly all Southern cities and towns, Partial or complete segregation, however brought about, is almost equally common in Northern towns and cities which have considerable Negro populations. 

"The general reflection which the facts suggest is that economic discrimination against Negroes is national and not merely sectional. It is not a reflection which should give any of us pleasure. Whatever may be our wisest course with the race in matters political and social, hardly any of us would deny that it is entitled to a fair chance in matters economic and industrial. The right to vote is one thing. The right to work, and to enjoy the fruit of one's labors, is quite another thing." 

Inspired by Baltimore, one Mr. Vonderlehr, of Richmond, seeks to segregate the colored population of his town in what the Richmond Leader calls an "eminently wise and judicious measure," which will appeal to the "good citizenship" of the colored man.

"Segregation," remarks the Leader, "has proved to be a mitigation, if not a solution of the race problem." The "Jim Crow" car law, the Leader thinks, has done much for the peace and comfort of.the traveling public—meaning, presumably, the white traveling public—and is an "unmixed blessing." "Some ill-advised Negroes have indeed railed against it. This, however, has only accentuated its need and its usefulness." 

The colored folk of New Orleans have been complaining that if they are to be segregated on cars and in schools they should not be forced to have white teachers, white bartenders and so on. The *Times-Democrat*, which thinks that objection to segregation shows an "abject lack of race-pride," holds that the Negroes are justified in some of their contentions. 

"The speakers complained, not without reason, that these practices did not accord with the demand of the whites for segregation; were unfair and grossly inconsistent. A protest was lodged also against the methods by which the 'Jim Crow' screens in the local street cars were manipulated. 

"We are not at all sure that the objection leveled against the street car usage is well taken, but there is no doubt of the justice of their complaint against the inconsistency of employing white teachers in Negro schools and white bartenders in black saloons. The Negroes have done well to protest, and we think the practices against which they complain can and should be stopped."
