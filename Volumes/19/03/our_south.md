# "Our" South (1920)

One of the surprising self-deceptions of the white Southerners is illustrated by this story of the war: Because of its large Negro working population, a government shipbuilding yard was brought to Wilmington, N.C., during the late war. The city congratulated itself, but balked finally at providing Negro workingmen with adequate housing. At a public meeting they lauded the whites and their enterprise to the skies, but complained to the government agents of the "burden" of the Negro---the black half of their population, said one pompous orator, was a "liability and not an asset."

"Well," replied an unimaginative northern Colonel, who wanted ships built instead of talk, "if it wasn't for this liability, you wouldn't have gotten this ship-yard!"

The fundamental error of the white South thus shown is seen in the assumption that ALL property is WHITE property; that they benevolently "give" Negroes work; that they let them walk THEIR streets and "pay for" their schools.

In economic thought the South is 100 years behind the civilized world. In what civilized land today can a ruling aristocracy deny a mass of eight million laborers an absolute right to education, to public institutions, and even to a voice in the use and distribution of "private" property?
