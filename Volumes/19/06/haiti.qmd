The United States is at war with Haiti. Congress has never
sanctioned this war. Josephus Daniels has illegally and unjustly
occupied a free foreign
land and murdered its inhabitants by the thousands. He has deposed its
officials and dispersed its legally elected representatives; He is
carrying on a reign of terror, brow-beating, and cruelty, at the hands
of southern white naval officers and marines. For more than a year this
red-handed deviltry has proceeded, and today the Island is in open
rebellion. The greatest single question before the parties at the next
election is the Freedom of Haiti.
