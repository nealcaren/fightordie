# Tenements (1916)

We sincerely trust that individuals and organizations friendly to the
Negro are not going to be led into segregation schemes and ghetto plans
by organized real estate interests masking as philanthropists. Movements
toward furnishing model tenements for colored people are on foot in New
York, Chicago and other cities. They are on their face in every way
commendable. For the most part colored people in large cities have been
compelled to put up with the old fashioned, inconvenient dwellings which
white tenants no longer wanted, or they have gotten hold of better class
houses only by the payment of exorbitant rents. The experiments of the
Suburban Homes Company in New York City show conclusively that an
excellent class of colored tenants may be had and good accommodations
furnished at a fair rental. This effort should be extended; but when we
find taking part in such philanthropic efforts the identical real estate
interests in New York which have been working for years to oust colored
people from the decent parts of Harlem and establish
them upon the mud flats of the river in the extreme northeast, we have a
right to view the matter with suspicion. The crucial question is, in New
York and Chicago, WHERE are these proposed new tenements to be? Are they
to be in a segregated district, or are they to be where there is light,
air, transportation and decent surroundings? One great victory for
anti-segregation democracy has been the buying of a site for the New
York colored branch of the Y.M.C.A. outside of the proposed
segregated dead line.

We would be very glad if the Urban League and the Harlem Property
Owners' Improvement Corporation would let the public know where their
proposed new tenements in New York are to be erected.
