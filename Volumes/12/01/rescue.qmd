The colored troops are leading in the Mexican foray. It is a foolish venture. Just the kind of mistake that we are beginning to think is characteristic of the Wilson administration. Nevertheless "Theirs not to reason why," and consequently the Tenth Cavalry with Major Young in command of the Second Squadron is now in Mexico. As one report says: "Especial credit should be given the Tenth." Then, too, the Twenty-fourth, another colored regiment, has been called to support the movement. So in America, in Europe and in Africa black men are fighting for the liberties of white men and pulling their chestnuts out of the fire. One of these bright mornings black men are going to learn how to fight for themselves.
