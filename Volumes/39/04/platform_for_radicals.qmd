Here is a platform which does not involve murder or revolution, but which we recommend to the most radical of our friends, as a step toward the millennium. Consider it:

1. Absolute publicity of private income and its sources.
2. Registration of all workers with the sort of work they do.
3. Absolute publicity of property ownership, not only for real estate but for stocks, bonds, notes and all forms of legal ownership.
4. No tax-exempt property of any sort, no matter who owns it, and publicity of all taxes paid.

Will this bring us the millennium? Oh no! But it will give us a basis of fact upon which we may argue, and that is exactly what we lack today.
