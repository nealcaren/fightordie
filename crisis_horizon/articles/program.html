<hr>


<p>I desire this afternoon to read to the First Sociological Club a
candid criticism of its’ work and a suggestion for its’ future activity.
I do this the more boldly because I am a member of the organization and
as such must bear my part of the responsibility for its’ short­ comings;
and at the same time, I speak as an outsider, for in the year that I
have had my name on the rolls I have had no opportunity to share in the
work of the club. I always hear with a certain foreboding shiver of the
formation of a club for any kind of sociological work, for my experience
has taught me that the percentage of absolute failure among such clubs
is very large. The trouble is apt to be that the persons forming clubs
for social reform have very vague ideas of what the science of sociology
really is, and what is the real aim and object of their striving.
Consequently it can easily happen that they drift aimlessly on until the
members begin to wonder whether it is worthwhile to waste so much time
doing nothing. I fancy I have seen in this club something of the same
tendency, and it seems to me that the great need of this organization is
a clearer conception of its’ aims and more practical and persistent work
to accomplish these objects.</p>
<p>I have therefore chosen for my subject <em>A Program for a
Sociological Society</em>, and I want to divide what I have to say in
six parts. First I want to show what Sociology is. Second— What the
science has accomplished. Third— By what methods its work has been done.
Fourth— How the material and knowledge thus collected can best be
utilized. Fifth— What the society has already accomplished and why, And
finally what this society might and ought to do.</p>
<h2 id="st.-what-is-sociology">1st. What is Sociology</h2>
<p>There was a vast revolution which took place in the early part
of<span id="Page_2" class="pagenum">[2]</span> this century that is too
often forgotten by educated people. It came after that terrible upheaval
of human institutions which we call the French Revolution, after the
orgies of Robespierre, Danton, and Marat, and became finally the great
instrument that freed Europe from the grasp of the arch-tyrant Napoleon.
This revolution was the industrial revolution of the 19th century. It
began in the 18th century, when the science of chemistry was first well
established, when geology gained a sure foundation when Brinley showed
the world how to dig canals uphill, when iron began to be smelted by
coal instead of charcoal, and above all when James Watt turned a
tea-kettle into a steam engine. Such epoch-making inventions changed the
civilization of the world and with the dawn of the 19th century came an
industrial revolution — factories started up, towns grew, commerce
expanded, capital increased, the world market widened. If we regard this
industrial movement more carefully we shall see that of all departments
of human industry the manufacture of cotton made the most gigantic
strides in this epoch. The ancient world dressed in wool, the middle age
in wood and linen, the modern world dressed largely in cotton. The
series of inventions that made cotton manufacture possible are a curious
example of coincidence. Between the years 1775 and 1825, Arkwright
Hargreaves, Cartwright, and Eli Whitney had changed the spinning wheel
into the factory and made the southern United States the cotton field of
the world.</p>
<p>This industrial revolution had serious consequences: first it
fastened American Slavery in this country and made emancipation more
difficult, and the Negro problem more baffling; More that that in all
lands it gave rise to and intensified those intricate questions of life
and death and civilization which we call social problems: human being
were, by the new concentration of industrys, crowded into centers of
population and the difficulties, <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;deseases&quot; in original.">diseases</span>,
and maladjustments of human life became intensified and more patent to
the eye. Crime, poverty, <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;desease&quot; in original.">disease</span>,
pros<span id="Page_3" class="pagenum">[3]</span>titution, ignorance, and
death began to assume threatening proportions. Men came to be attracted
to these sinister phenomena and to ask what they real­ly meant, how far
they were remediable, and how far inevitable.</p>
<p>There was then but one science which undertook the study of the
phenomena of human action and th twas the science of political economy.
But this science was limited in scope: it began in the 17th nd 18th
century when the phenomena of money and international trade first
assumed importance and confined itself simply to a study of wealth: it
asked how goods were produced, how they were distributed among the
producers, and how their owners exchanged them for other goods. It thus
took into account only a feW human activities under stable conditions of
society. The industrial revolution, however, had greatly changed
conditions, and brought a distinct demand for wider inquiry into the
causes and scope of human action — deeper search for the reasons of
present conditions and the intelligent application of such knowledge to
methods of social regeneration. This was the beginning of th modern
science of Sociology.</p>
<p>Sociology is therefore the name given to that vast field of inquiry
into human action aa manifested in modern organized life. It cannot
study all human action under all circumstances, but <span
class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;thay&quot; in original.">that</span>
human action which by its regularity gives evidence of the presence of
laws. What these laws are we hardly know, and yet we do know that there
are in life curious and noticeable coincidences — <span
class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;rythm&quot; in original.">rhythm</span>
in life and death, a working out of cause and effect, <span
class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;evidenes&quot; in original.">evidences</span>
of force action and reaction, which cannot be ignored or neglected. Many
eminent men still insist that this mass of partially digested facts
cannot be called a science — and indeed if you mean by science, a body
knowledge with definitely stated laws, and carefully systematized facts,
then Sociology is not yet a science and may never become one. But if you
mean by Sociology a vast and fruitful field of inquiry into the
mysterious phenomena of human action, which has yielded evidence of the
working of scientific laws to some extent, and promises much for the
future — if such a work deserves, as many<span id="Page_4"
class="pagenum">[4]</span> think, the name of science, then Sociology is
one of the greatest of sciences.</p>
<p>But it is impossible to tell what a <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;sciene&quot; in original.">science</span>
is merely by defining it — the definition is the last thing a science
discovers — indeed it can truth­fully be said that no science can be
fully defined until it is perfect, until its work is done. The best
explanation of a science then is a description of the sort of work it is
doing and what it has already accomplished. I come therefore to the
second point in my talk.</p>
<h2 id="nd.-what-has-sociology-done">2nd. What has Sociology done?</h2>
<p>Sociology has studied the proportionate number of the two sexes in
the different countries, the number of people of different ages, the
number of births each year in different localities, the number of deaths
from various diseases, the size of families, the average number of rooms
in dwellings, the extent of illiteracy, the number of communicants in
the different churches the occupations which men pursue, the income from
their work, the way that income is expended; the number of the blind,
deaf, dumb, and insane, the extent and degree of poverty, the prevalence
of suicide, the extent and kinds of crime, the characteristics of
criminals, the distribution and migration of population, the
distribution of property, etc. Moreover it has sought to generalize much
of this mass of facts and show how all these actions and phenomenas tend
to a certain rhythm and regularity which we call the social group. In
the social group the distribution of the sex and age of the individuals
remain continually about the same despite birth and death, and the rate
of births and deaths varies so little that it can be predicted within
limits. The income, occupation, expenditure, and crime tends in the same
way under forms of law. This so-called Social Law seems partly
voluntary, partly involuntary, but in all cases its regularity is much
greater than the casual reader dreams. These social groups in turn
combine to form that higher generalization which we call Society.
Society is simply a general name for the regularities of human action —
for the general fact that when 50, 100, <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;Or&quot; in original.">or</span>
1,000,000 live together they do not all act irresponsibly or at random
but according to well-known<span id="Page_5" class="pagenum">[5]</span>
maxims, social forces and laws.</p>
<p>All this that I have said can best be illustrated by a few actual
examples. In Europe, for instance, repeated investigation has proven
that for every 1,000 males there are about 1,024 females. This is
Characteristic of old countries. In the United States, on the other hand
there are only 952 females for every 1,000 males. In the older, eastern
states, however, we should expect to find conditions approaching those
in Europe — and sure enough there are 1,005 females to every 1,000
males. To show the significence of such facts let us go a step farther:
We find in the city of Baltimore 1,310 Negro women to every 1,000 men.
We can immediately say this is surely an abnorman situation and must
have something to do with the large number of illegitimate births in
that city.</p>
<p>Statistics of age show that in normal countries about one third of
the population is under 15 years of age, yet the nations vary
considerably: for instance take children under 10 years of age; in
England they form 24% of the population, in France only 18%, among the
Negroes of the land 28%. Turning now to the old people 60 and over and
we find that they form 7% of the population of England; 13% of that of
France; and 2% among our race. Such differences simply mean poor family
life among our people.</p>
<p>The statistics of births and deaths are always of great interest and
consequently liable to misuse. We may have two especially marked types:
a population with a low birth-rate and low death-rate like France or a
population with a high birth rate and high death rate like American
Negro. The latter is a sign of a low standard of culture — early
marriage, illegitimacy and neglect of the laws of health; the the former
is usually a sign of high civilization — postponement of marriage until
the support of a family is assured, and life according to the laws of
hygiene. Son in the same country the character of a community may easily
be approximately fixed by measuring the number <span
class="pagenum">[6]</span> of people in every thousand that die
annually. A death rate above 26 is high, while one above 30 points to
grave dangers. The rate may be as low as 18 as in Norway. The average
death rate of Negroes in cities is 34.</p>
<p>Where sociological inquiry reveals great differences in the
conditions of different groups of people this is usually evidence of
some unseen cause which makes the variation. For instance, we can
represent the occupations of the people of Philadelphia by the following
set of door steps:</p>
<p><img src="Images/program_figure1.png" /></p>
<p>If however we represent the occupations of the Negroes of the city,
we find the steps hard for climbing.</p>
<p><img src="Images/program_figure2.png" /></p>
<p>What is the meaning of this striking difference? It is explained
fully by one comprehensive word SLAVERY. Thus history writes itself in
figures and diagrams.</p>
<p>In the matter of crime, sociology has done some of its best work; let
us notice only one — the connection of crime and age. In Germany for
instance it has been found that 15% of all persons between 21 and 40
have been convicted for crime, 9% of those between 40 and 60, and 7% of
those between 12 and 18 years of age. Further analyzing these figures it
is found that the most criminal age is between 20 and 30, and among
young unmarried men. Taking for instance the Negro criminal in the
Eastern section of Pennsylvania; we find the remarkable fact that 67% of
them were under 30 years of age and 11% under 20.</p>
<p>Using such minute and detailed statistics sociology has built up the
theory of the social group. The country village is a social group. <span
class="pagenum">[7]</span> Its population distributed in a certain
normal order as to age and sex and conjugal condition. Its birth and
death regulating the increase of population. There is some crime, a
school, a church, a village store. The population is divided among
different occupations, social classes make a faint appearance and there
is a general public opinion which represents of synthesis of like ideas.
Such a group may grow to a city or to a nation, but as it grows we note
certain peculiarities: it forms within itself other smaller groups for
special purposes — clubs for amusement or reading, church societies,
associations of capital and labor called shops or companies or factories
and etc. These sub-groups we might call organs for carrying out the
special work of society, just as the tissues of the body form here a
heart and here an eye to serve the whole organism of the body. This we
refer to when we speak of society being <strong>organized</strong> — of
course this is but an analogy for the organization of society is far
from complete and individual free will must ever hinder that
consummation in this world. Nevertheless advance in civilization is to a
certain extent advance in the perfecting of the organization of
society.</p>
<p>Such is the work that Sociology has accomplished. It is to be sure
only a beginning: our statistics are woefully imperfect. Our methods of
observation are crude and the material at hand is largely an
unclassified mass of facts, the value of which is various and uncertain.
Nevertheless gigantic strides have been taken in the last 10 years,
something has been done, and the outlook for the future is bright. This
brings me to the fourth point I wish to discuss.</p>
<h2>
4th. The Use of Sociological Material
</h2>
<p>The interest in social reform and general betterment which animates
so many excellent people today must not be mistaken for the science of
Sociology. There are many people who have a vague desire to right
wrongs, help the needy, and reform the vicious. Unfortunately these
people in <span class="pagenum">[8]</span> very many <span
class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;instanses&quot; in original.">instances</span>
are ignorant of the results of scientific research in these lines — they
do not know the value and meaning of statistics and they often waste
money and energy, or do absolute harm, either by antiquated or
discredited methods. If anyone should inform an ordinary citizen that
chemists had discovered a new element, Argon — he would say very well or
bravo I and be done — he would not attempt to discuss the matter or draw
conclusions — he is no chemist and does not attempt to be. If he wishes
to use the results of chemical research he seeks the advice of a
chemist. In the realm of sociology, however, the case is very different:
tell a man that the death rate of the Negroes is 36, and immediately he
is ready to discuss the matter, write articles, form clubs, and spend
money although he knows that he is not an expert in statistics or a
student of sociology. What ought to happen in this case is clear: the
man ought to say candidly that he knows nothing about death rates — is
36 high or low or medium? What has been the history of the variation of
death rates? How do the death rates of different peoples compare with
this? A sensible man ought to ask: What does a death rate of 36
<strong>mean</strong>: what in the light of the expert statistical
knowledge and the careful sociological research of the last quarter
century, is the proper interpretation of this figure 36, which otherwise
is to me a Sphinx and an enigma.</p>
<p>The civilized and thinking part of the modern world is gradually and
surely coming to this position. The first thing people ask of social
reformers now in not how earnest are you or how great is the need of
reform but rather what do you know about the actual situation and how
does the best of expert opinion interpret these facts. Men recognize the
fact that such expert opinion may err but they are coming to see that
the occasional error of men who give their life to knowing is not as
dangerous as the perpetual error of men who guess or dogmatize. The
facts and the meaning of the facts are then the first steps in modern
social reform.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span> How now shall the mass of
intelligent people who have not time to be experts put themselves in
position to use the material collected by sociologists in the practical
work of reform? We can best answer this by seeing the work done in
reform during this century.</p>
<p>One of the first movements was the English Abolition of the
slave-trade: for this the House of Commons collected a mass of
statistics — the number of ships engaged, the amount of capital
invested, the methods employed to capture slaves, the routes of sailing,
the number transported, the death rate among slaves and sailors, and
etc. They sought the history of the subject, the general conditions, the
opinions of exports statisticians and when they began to legislate on
the subject they knew what they were doing and no nation had done so
much to stop Negro slavery as these same Englishmen who studied the
matter so thoroughly.</p>
<p>Again take the matter of prison reform. When the question was first
agitated there wasn’t a crank in England or America that hadn’t an
opinion and a panacea — It was do this, do that, make their punishment
as severe as that of galley slaves; treat them as unfortunate victims of
society; make their work hard, let them lie idle; hang them, give them
tracts to read, and etc. Society has outgrown this: gradually here and
there we have collected facts — not how someone thinks a plan might work
but how the plan actually did work when it was tried; we have studied
criminals instead of taking it for granted that we know them, we have
watched crime instead of theorizing about it and then with the material
we have tried careful experiments — experiments in housing prisoners,
experiments in punishment, experiments in work and diet; until today no
intelligent man thinks of aimlessly giving advice as to crime — he knows
that this is a subject for experts — a subject still dark, with much to
be learned, but still a realm where the day of guesswork is past. In the
matter of charity, perhaps the greatest advance has been made. The
classic examples of this is the history of the English poor law. At
first England frowned fiercely on beggery and poverty and whipped and
<span class="pagenum">[10]</span> branded and hanged the poor devils.
Then she melted into sentiment and coddled and stuffed her paupers until
it seemed ae though all England would go to begging. Finally the state
bethought itself to ask who are the paupers, what makes pauperism, how
can we decrease it and help people to help themselves? For this reason
it now uses the statistics, studies social conditions, organizes
charitable societies, avoids duplications of work, detects importers and
seeks in every way to know the causes of poverty and apply intelligent
and scientific remedies. The world is still far from solving the problem
but we are much nearer than men were in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>
<p>Thus sociological material is today used by all kinds of social
reforms: the organizers of childrens societies,and of schools; those who
seed to help the deaf and the <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;bling&quot; in original.">blind</span>,
those who want to get work for the idle; saving banks and building
associations are established on carefully ascertained principles, model
homes built for tenants — indeed this is the age when lasting and
effective reform has become systematic and scientific and has replaced
sentiment and theory.</p>
<p>The question now comes:</p>
<h2>
5th. What Has the First Sociological Society done?
</h2>
<p>I want to be perfectly frank in this matter and to say plainly that
in my opinion this society has done nothing. I know we have organized —
we have held meetings. We have had pleasant social gatherings and we
have talked. But of actual work accomplished either in the line of
knowing just what there is to be done, and just how we are to do it, and
what there is to be learned as to method from the sociological work of
the day, and above all of actual accomplished work, it seems to me
perfectly fair to say that this society has done little more than
nothing. Indeed I have several times seriously asked myself whether I
was justified in attending those meetings and whether there was a
reasonable prospect of an end of aimless talking and a beginning of
definite doing. We seem to me in the first place to have no clear idea
of what the society is for; <span class="pagenum">[11]</span> we seem
again to have a tendency to fritter away precious time on trifles, we
seen to forget when we are discussing ways and means that all this is
not mere theory but that definite information of the experience of
others in the work and of the general state of scientific knowledge on
most of these points is easily obtainable. And finally we seem in the
laying out of our definite practical work for committee to have not the
faintest shade of an idea of the enormous difficulties and infinite
complications of some of the subject we undertake. To <span
class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;particularies&quot; in original.">particularities</span>,
at the last meeting the subject for discussion was the influence of
tenement life on small children — a subject of the deepest importance
and of wide influence There is a perfect mass of material on the subject
— studies, maps and plans, vital statistics, satieties of dwellings and
occupations, measurements of children’s bodies, experiments as to mental
aptitude, inquiries into home life — indeed I could without difficulty
gather right here in Atlanta a hundred volumes of material on the point
to be discussed. If a sociological society had been going to discuss
that subject what would one reasonably expect the trend of the
discussion to be?</p>
<p>They would expect first that the general conditions of slums would be
<span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;wxplained: Bootha&quot; in original.">explained:
Both</span> maps of London would be exhibited and studies shown of the
physical environments; the Hull House maps and papers would have been
taken next; something would have been said of the slums of New York and
Philadelphia. Then the general question of children would be approached
— what physical surroundings are necessary and the lack of these would
be illustrated by the death rate of children in slums; the moral demands
of child life would be touched upon and criminal statistics produced to
show how youthful criminals are bred in the slums; finally we would have
the evil social effects — lewd talk, <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;illegimate&quot; in original.">illegitimate</span>
children, prostitution, personal uncleaness, the spread of disease and
the like. Those are some very elementary matters connected with the life
of children in slums which any consideration of the subject must take
up. But beside this the central part of the discussion ought to have
been the slums of Atlanta: we <span class="pagenum">[12]</span> ought to
have had the map of several typical alleys showing the size and relation
of the houses, the number of rooms, the number dwelling there, and the
number and size of children; the general characteristics of the
families, the ability of the children in school or at work, the number
of deaths in the alley in a year, the kinds of diseases, and a general
history of the alley. From one to five such studies might have been
made.</p>
<p>Such is what we might reasonably expect <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;tin&quot; in original.">in</span>
the discussion of this subject by a club which calls itself
sociological. And yet I doubt if any member of this society went from
that discussion with a single new fact or idea. Nobody had studied the
subject, nobody knew anything about the matter, <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;noone&quot; in original.">no
one</span> had any information to impart. About two days before the
meeting in the midst of a busy week’s work I was informed that I was
expected to discuss a subject which experts have been studying 10 to 20
years. And when out of sheer respect for the intelligence of these
members I mildly protested that two days was not enough time for such a
subject — the society blandly waved its hand, and said “why you had
<strong>three</strong> days”.</p>
<p>I remember last year at the Altanta Conference, the president of this
society gave an outline of this organization and a list of its
committees. I must confess it made a splendid showing: but there was one
fact that the president omitted to mention and that was that very few of
those committees had done any work worth mentioning. Nor was this the
fault of the president: he had urged the society again and again to do
actual work and the society did attempt to help the Atlanta Conference,
but of all the bad reports that came into that conference that of this
clubs was the worst. If it had not been for the personal work of
Dr. Butler and Mr. Matthews the Atlanta Conference would have had to
omit Atlanta from the cities investigated. I said to myself, however,
this society is young yet — next fall the work will begin. And lo! at
the first meeting I attended the club was adopting a new constitution. I
must say I was somewhat disgusted — what do we want I thought of a New
Constitution when we have done nothing <span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
under the old one. A constitution is not worth the paper it is written
on unless it is backed by deeds and give the deeds and I care not
whether we have a constitution or not. One of the objects of the new
constitution was said to be the facilitating of the organizing of other
sociological clubs in other cities. I would as soon think of my baby
advertising to teach persons to walk - why he can’t walk himself.</p>
<p>After the new constitution was adopted the same difficulties appeared
as last year in the apportioning of work to committees. One afternoon
last year we casually discussed the matter of crime. In a moment the
discussion sped - we swept through the calendar of crimes in 15 minutes
and attacked the subject of criminals; pausing there a moment we sailed
rally to the matter of punishment, then to slums and education, then to
the conduct of courts, then to color discrimination, then to the
situation of the south and to the Negro problems. A library of 10,000
volumes would not have covered the matters we lightly discussed in that
afternoon and then as I was opening my eyes in wonder, we suddenly
appointed a committee and charged it with the whole matter. Does anyone
wonder that we haven’t heard from that committee since? It is my candid
opinion that if we had appointed a committee of 100 persons and given
several thousand dollars to expend they could not possibly have
accomplished the work we gave them in less than 300 years.</p>
<p>The trouble is we despise the day of little things — we neglect
little movements, small efforts, tentative experiments, and throw
ourselves blindly against adamantive walls which have withstood the
assaults of philanthropists for centuries, we had a simple program of
work laid before us; it was suggested that we make a careful map of the
Negro slums of Atlanta and see how they were situated with regard to the
various agencies for <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;ggod&quot; in original.">good</span>.
This was not theory or experiment — it was simply analogous to a great
work now being done in New York City. Yet this society virtually spoiled
the plan by appointing an aimless committee to give pastors of var<span
class="pagenum">[14]</span>ious churches advice as to their mission
fields in the city. The chairman of the committee protested at the time
that this method of attacking the matter would not do — but not we must
have the committee. And of course the committee never reported for it
had nothing to report, several times other promising definite proposals
for small beginnings have been made but no sooner were they launched
then someone proposed something else, another pointed out that this
method would not reform everybody and made the sunshine 24 hours in the
day and the whole plan became amended and blocked and died a <span
class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;conpeacefulyditon&quot; in original.">peaceful</span>
death in committees.</p>
<p>To sum up then: we as a society are not sure what we ought to do; and
we have made clumsy and ineffectual attempts to do a mass of things
without a knowledge of the facts or of the well-grounded theory of the
subject. We add to our membership in a haphazard way, forcing people to
join who simply come to visit; we appoint committees and distribute work
in a way equally accidental and thoughtless and above all we yield to
the temptation to talk and discuss when we have nothing to say.</p>
<p>But enough of criticism. I know it is much easier to find fault then
to avoid fault — to pick flaws in work done than to do work. And yet
candid criticism has its place — it lies at the root of all reform and
after all in this devious world perhaps the wonder is that we stray so
little rather than that we err so much.</p>
<p>Let me therefore turn to the last point I wish to consider.</p>
<h2>
6th. What this Society might and ought to do.
</h2>
<p>The aim of a society of this kind ought to be to furnish accurate
information to such agencies as are engaged in th* work of social
reform, to endeavor to increase the cooperation between those agencies,
and to seek to establish new agencies for reform in neglected and
unknown fields of effort. Let me take up these 2 things in order:</p>
<p>First, I say, this society should aim to gather facts and information
for its own and others use. I was once pursuing an elaborate piece of
investigation in regard to the negroes of a certain city, when I came
across <span class="pagenum">[15]</span> a woman who could if she would
give me much valuable matter, she looked at me suspiciously and said,
“What’s the object of this investigation?” “simply to get at the truth”,
I answered. “Do you propose to do anything after you get the facts”,
said she. “We simply collect the facts”, I returned, “Others may use
them as they will” Then you are trying only to get facts and not to
better things”, she said. “Yes”, I again answered. “Humph, she replied
and I’m still waiting for that information. Now this illustrates well
the attitude of many minds toward careful and systematic collection of
minute facts. Men are so filled with ideas of reform that they haven’t
time to study the abuses which they seek to abolish and baldly assume
that they know all about them. One of the most baffling things about the
Negro problem today is the fact that so many people in this country are
absolutely convinced that they thoroughly understand it. Especially is
every Negro supposed to be <strong>born</strong> with a thorough
understanding of this intricate problem in all its bearings. And yet a
moment’s thought will convince us all of our ignorance. How many of us
hear really know very much of the history and present <span
class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;conditon&quot; in original.">condition</span>
of the eight millions of our race in this land? <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;we&quot; in original.">We</span>
call the”negro problem” certain bits of personal experience, joined to
some ready and general information and to a good deal of gossip. There
is not one of us that does not need to study</p>
<p><span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;thououghly&quot; in original.">thoroughly</span>
and minutely any part of this subject which we propose to work upon.
This society should be a center for gathering such information in
Atlanta, we ought to begin to study thoroughly, comprehensively, and
minutely the situation of the Negroes of this city — we ought to become
a bureau of accurate information for all facts connected with the Negro
— wealth and poverty, business and labor, crime and pauperism, charity
and reform, homes and streets, migration, wages, occupations, marriage
and divorce, illegitimacy, education, church organizations, other
organizations - every general fact which bears upon the condition of the
Negro in this city, past and present ought to be carefully collected and
recorded, and now and then published. <span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
We should follow th« history of alleys, compile a careful list of the
worthy, study minutely the abode and history of the criminals, keep an
eye upon orphans and homeless waifs — in fact, no fact or condition
should escape the eye and pen of a society whose chief desire it is to
know the social problems they seek to solve.</p>
<p>For this work we should have committees, and every member of the
organization be a member of some committee. Each committee should work
under a chairman and the chairman could if he saw fit appoint
sub-committees. At every meeting it should be the work of each committee
to report some carefully ascertained facts to this committee and to
report in writing not orally. The facts may be small or unimportant,
they may be a study of a whole district, they may be historic data,
illustrative incidents, but always accurate, always reliable and always
designed to teach us more of the actual situation of the people and
guide our feet in matters of reform.</p>
<p>These committee should be standing committees and no other committee
ought to be appointed during the year, save in very exceptional cases.
The committees should be appointed on such subjects as Poverty. Crime,
Health, Homes, Churches, Education, Occupations, the defective classes,
Wealth, Reading, and etc. — That is, simple comprehensive fields where
much may be learned.</p>
<p>Second, we should endeavor to increase cooperation among the various
agencies for social betterment among the Negroes of Atlanta: these
agencies are the churches, the schools, the <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;secred&quot; in original.">secret</span>
and insurance societies, and the benevolent efforts of various kinds.
Our object here should be not to meddle, not to interfere in the work of
others, but by spreading information and pointing out fields of action
we <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;shoud&quot; in original.">should</span>
seek to reduce the duplication of benevolent work to a minimum and get
the widest good fellowship and cooperation possible. Mother’s meeting,
lectures, circulating libraries, savings associations and general reform
work could in this way be spread by sheer contagion through the various
church constituencies and communities.</p>
<p>This society should stand ready to send to ever single church in
Atlanta <span class="pagenum">[17]</span> two, three times a year
competent persons to explain to the members some elementary matter of
reform — ventilation, the use of water, sewing schools, hygienic
cooking, reading, saving, and etc. in this way effort could be
stimulated in existing agencies toward betterment of present
conditions.</p>
<p>For this purpose there should be an executive committee under the
chairmanship of the president which should arrange meetings and
conferences, and tell us what other movements are doing and seek to
build gradually a central board which would federate all the benevolent
efforts of the city among Negroes and cooperate with similar efforts
among whites.</p>
<p>Thirdly the society should endeavor to find out and explore fields of
<span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;re reformatory&quot; in original.">reformatory</span>
effort neglected by other agencies, or forgotten or unknown. And should
seek here to inaugurate new movements for betterment. In this work
however great care must be exercised. Our committees stand for ears open
to all sounds from everywhere and letting no whisper escape. But our
efforts at actual reform must not be thus dispersed. We cannot reform
the whole world at one, we must concentrate our efforts; one thing at a
time and that a small thing; careful tentative effort, feeling our way
slowly, making no failures and takin no backward steps and above all
remembering that permanent reform is slow work and that 10 years in such
work is a mere bagatelle. <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;one&quot; in original.">One</span>
thing at a time then and let that one thing take our whole strength.
<span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;we mingt&quot; in original.">We
might</span> for instance do this: each of us here might <span
class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;contribut&quot; in original.">contribute</span>
to the committee <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;onSchools&quot; in original.">on
schools</span> a book suitable for children to read. We each might get a
few friends to give similar books. Then this modest little library of
say 25 or 30 volumes properly labelled and cased might be place in one
of the public schools to circulate <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;fr&quot; in original.">for</span> a
month. Then in another school for a month, then in another, next year we
might collect another small library — in 10 years we might thus place in
every school house in the city a circulating library and begin to send
some to the country schools — simple work, nothing great, no wholesale
manufacture of saints, nothing to wave our hands about or yell, but
<strong>Work</strong>, <strong>Reform</strong> and
<strong>Advance</strong> such as in the past has built nations and <span
class="pagenum">[18]</span> and empires. When this enterprise was well
started and in charge of the proper committee — or possibly given over
to some special organization, we could begin another and larger effort —
but slowly, carefully. <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;we&quot; in original.">We</span>
could start a movement toward a penny savings bank. Not a money making
institution, but a benevolent enterprise to encourage thrift run on
business principles. We could select in the city three or four Negroes
whose reputation for honesty and profity was unquestioned. If possible
we would ask three or four interested white men to act with them and
form the directory board of a Negro Penny Savings bank. Each church
could be induced to hold meetings and hear talks on thrift and little
things. The various schools — Spelman, Atlanta Baptist, Clark, Morris
Brown and others could preach a crusade of saving at chapel exercises.
At several of the larger colored stores, a small stand, a tin box, and a
padlock could be placed and a member of the committee on saving could be
placed there from 8 to 10 P.M. on Wednesday and Saturday night.
Bankbooks with stamped receipts could be given out. Ihe enterprise would
flourish for a while then it would die down, but we would not die down —
more lectures, more talks, tracts, and posters, a notice in the
Constitution and habits of saving would begin to grow and we would
gradually know where to place our branches — how to encourage people. In
five years we might have $200 or $300 in deposits; in 10 years $2–3000.
In 15 years we might hire modest quarters, use our money for a building
association or surrender the whole work to a special society, nothing
great in such a movement — nothing to take ones breath away — it has
been done a hundred times in other cities among other people and in a
few cases among Negroes — but this true rising — which does not
necessarily call for a constitution on paper but it calls for a certain
mental and moral constitution in us which is too often lacking.</p>
<p>I might easily go on naming a hundred different methods of work <span
class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;distributy&quot; in original.">distributing</span>
tracts, offering prizes in the schools and churches, a comprehensive
system of neighborhood visiting, careful organized and persistently
<span class="pagenum">[19]</span> conducted serine of mothers meetings
and fireside schools, temporary care of waifs and foundlings, shelters
for friendless girls, a social settlement house in the slums, — all
these and many more — not all at once, not all in a year, hut slowly,
gradually, doggedly — such work lies before.</p>
<p>Finally as to our meetings we must stop throwing away time in
endless, senseless and aimless talk. We are here for business, First we
want information on local conditions from the chairman of committees and
chairmen <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;haveing&quot; in original.">having</span>
nothing to report ought to be made to feel thoroughly ashamed for their
neglect and carelessness. The reports should oe brief, definite, and
contain actual data. We do not want essays on what ought to be dona but
what your committee actually has done and when it did it and how it did
it and what the result was. We do not want vague general statement but
definite, brief, concise records of date, place and deeds. After these
reports and a short discussion of the meaning of these facts then we
should turn to the work of the meeting: somebody who has studied
something and knows about it and has his knowledge in a shape to impart
clearly and somewhat more briefly than I am doing, should then take the
floor and teach us something, either in sociological theory, or in
efforts of other lands or cities, or in local conditions, we do not want
general essays, or schoolboy papers — but facts and information and
carefully weighed opinion. Then we can go knowing more than when we came
and better prepared for work. If <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;noone&quot; in original.">no
one</span> has such a paper prepared, then let us take one of the dozens
of excellent works on social questions and reading it, passing it from
hand to hand and discussing it. Our let us adopt a textbook and study
the subject we profess to know something of.</p>
<p>If in a half-century we thus increase our knowledge of social
conditions and start a few movements to better abuses then this club
will deserve well of the nation.</p>
<p>Fellow-workers, the Negro problem is in this room — between these
four walls and it is the question as to whether the best class of
intelligent <span id="Page_1" class="pagenum">[20]</span> Negroes can so
cooperate in unselfish effort as to better in some degree the condition
of the <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber&#39;s Note: &quot;Negroe&quot; in original.">Negro</span>
masses. Among the masses we have problems but not Negro problems — there
are problems of crime, of poverty, of sexual lewdness, of ill-health, of
heredity. The <strong>Negro</strong> problem is the question whether
those who have raised themselves above this dead level of degradation
can do as other nations have done — cooperate, investigate, sacrifice,
and lift as they climb.</p>
