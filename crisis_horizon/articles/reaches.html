<p><span id="Page_386" class="pagenum">[385]</span> Once upon a time in
my younger years and in the dawn of this century I wrote: “The problem
of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.” It was a
pert and singing phrase which I then liked and which since I have often
rehearsed to my soul and asked:—how far is this prophecy or speculation?
To-day in the last years of the century’s first quarter, let us examine
the matter again, especially in the memory of that great event of these
great years, the World War. Fruit of the bitter rivalries of economic
imperialism, the roots of that catastrophe were in Africa, deeply
entwined at bottom with the problems of the color line. And of the
legacy left, the problems the world inherits hold the same fatal seed;
world dissension and catastrophe still lurk in the unsolved problems of
race relations. What then is the world view that the consideration of
this question offers?</p>
<p>Most men would agree that our present problem of problems was not the
Color Problem, but what we call Labor, the problem of allocating work
and income in the tremendous and increasingly intricate world-embracing
industrial machine that our civilization has built. But despite our
concern and good will, is it not possible that in its consideration our
research is not directed to the vital spots geographically? Our good
will is too often confined to that labor which we see and feel and
exercise around us, rather than directed to the periphery of the vast
circle, where unseen and inarticulate, the determining factors are at
work. And may not the continual baffling of our <span id="Page_386"
class="pagenum">[386]</span> effort and failure of our formula be due to
just such mistakes? Modern imperialism and modern industrialism are one
and the same system; root and branch of the same tree. The race problem
is the other side of the labor problem; and the black man’s burden is
the white man’s burden. At least it will be of absorbing interest, to
step within these distant world shadows, and, looking backward, to view
the European and white American labor problem from this wide
perspective, remembering always that empire is the heavy hand of capital
abroad.</p>
<p>With nearly every great European empire to-day walks its dark
colonial shadow, while over all Europe there stretches the yellow shadow
of Asia that lies across the world. One might indeed read the riddle of
Europe by making its present plight a matter of colonial shadows,
speculating on what might happen if Europe became suddenly shadowless—if
Asia and Africa and the islands were cut permanently away. At any rate
here is a field of inquiry, of likening and contrasting each land and
its far-off shadow.</p>
<h2 id="the-shadow-of-portugal">The Shadow of Portugal</h2>
<p>I was attending the Third Pan-African Congress and I walked to the
Palacio dos Cortes with Magellan. It was in December, 1923, and in
Lisbon. I was rather proud. You see Magalhaes (to give him the
Portuguese spelling) is a mulatto—small light-brown and his hands quick
with gestures. Dr. José de Magalhaes is a busy man: a practising
specialist; professor in the School of Tropical Medicine whose new
buildings are rising; and above all, deputy in the Portuguese Parliament
from Sao Thomé, Africa. Thus this Angolese African, educated in Lisbon
and Paris, is one of the nine colored members of European Parliaments.
Portugal has had colored ministers and now has three colored deputies
and a senator. I saw two Portuguese in succession kissing one colored
member on the floor of the house. Or was he but a dark native? There is
so much ancient black blood in this peninsula.</p>
<p>Between the Portuguese and the African and near African there is
naturally no “racial” antipathy—no accumulated historical <span
class="pagenum">[387]</span> hatreds, dislikes, despisings. Not that you
would likely find a black man married to a Portuguese of family and
wealth, but on the other hand it seemed quite natural for Portugal to
make all the blacks of her African empire citizens of Portugal with the
rights of the European born.</p>
<p>Magalhaes and another represent Sao Thomé. They are elected by black
folk independent of party. Again and again I meet black folk from Sao
Thomé—young students, well-dressed, well-bred, evidently sons of
well-to-do if not wealthy parents, studying in Portugal, which harbors
annually a hundred such black students.</p>
<p>Sao Thomé illustrates some phases of European imperialism in Africa.
This industrial rule involves cheap land and labor in Africa and large
manufacturing capital in Europe, with a resultant opportunity for the
exercise of pressure from home investors and the press. Once in a
while—not often—a feud between the capitalists and the manufacturers at
home throws sudden light on Africa. For instance, in the Boer War the
“Cocoa Press” backed by the anti-war Liberals attacked the Unionists and
exposed labor conditions in South Africa. In retaliation, after the war
and when the Liberals were in power, the Unionists attacked labor
conditions in the Portuguese cocoa colonies.</p>
<p>When I heard that an English Lieutenant-Colonel was lecturing in
Lisbon, on this very island and its cocoa, I hastened to listen. As he
talked, I remembered. He was soothing the Portuguese.</p>
<p>The Colonel was an avowal reactionary, a hater of the “Aborigines
Protection Society,” Nevinson, Morel and all their ilk, and his
explanations were most illuminating. It would seem that “little
Englanders” backed by the Cadbury “Cocoa” press of “pacifist” leanings,
made a severe attack on the Unionists during the Boer War and
particularly attacked labor conditions on the Rand; besides opposing
Chamberlain, “Empire preference” and protection. When the Liberals came
into power in 1906 the Unionists in retaliation began to attack labor
conditions in Portuguese Sao Thomé, where Cadbury and others got their
cocoa and made the profits out of which <span
class="pagenum">[388]</span> they supported the “Daily Mail.” The
Colonel declared that labor conditions in Sao Thomé were quite ideal,
whereas Nevinson and others had declared that they constituted black
slavery. The point that interests us, however, is that the English cocoa
manufacturers were forced by frantic efforts to justify themselves and
deny all responsibility. They therefore proceeded to say that it wasn’t
true and if it was, the Portuguese were responsible. Under cover of this
bitter controversy an extraordinary industrial revolution took place: a
boycott was placed on Portuguese cocoa the world over, and under the
mists of recrimination the center of the cocoa-raising industry was
transferred from Portuguese to English soil—from Sao Thomé and Principé
to British Nigeria and the Gold Coast. Before 1900 less than one
thousand tons of cocoa had been raised in British West Africa annually;
by 1920 this had risen to one hundred and seventy thousand tons.</p>
<p>Of the real facts behind this rush of smoke I only know: that in the
end two new groups of black folk appeared above the horizon—the black
proprietors in Sao Thomé who still raise the best cocoa in the world and
who, freed of the over-lordship of English capital have achieved a
certain political independence in the Portuguese empire; and the black
peasant proprietors of the cocoa farms of Nigeria who have performed one
of the industrial miracles of a century and become the center of a world
industry. In this development note if you please the characteristic of
all color-line fights—the tearing across of all rational division of
opinion: here is Liberalism, anti-slavery and cocoa capitalism fighting
Toryism, free Negro proprietors and economic independence. Thus with a
democratic face at home, modern imperialism turns a visage of stern and
unyielding autocracy toward its darker colonies. This double-faced
attitude is difficult to maintain and puts hard strain on the national
soul that tries it.</p>
<p>Thus in this part of Portuguese Africa the worst aspects of slavery
melted away and colonial proprietors with smaller holdings could afford
to compete with the great planters; wherefore democracy, both
industrially and politically, took new life in black Portugal.
Intelligent black deputies appeared in the <span
class="pagenum">[389]</span> Portuguese parliaments, a hundred black
students studied in the Portuguese universities and a new colonial code
made black men citizens of Portugal with full rights. But in Portugal,
alas! no adequate democratic control has been established, nor can be
with an illiteracy of seventy-five percent; so that while the colonial
code is liberally worded, and economic power has brought some freedom in
Sao Thomé, unrestrained Portuguese and English capital still rules in
parts of Angola and in Portuguese East Africa, where no resisting public
opinion in England has yet been aroused. This shadow hangs heavily over
Portugal.</p>
<p>The African shadows of Spain and Italy are but drafts on some
imperial future not yet realized, and touch home industry and democracy
only through the war budget. But Spain is pouring treasure into a future
Spanish Morocco, and Italy has already poured out fabulous sums in the
attempt to annex north and northeast Africa, especially Abyssinia. The
prince who is to-day visiting Europe is the first adult successor of
that black Menelik who humbled Italy to the dust at Adowa in 1896.
Insurgent Morocco, independent Abyssinia and Liberia are, as it were,
shadows of Europe on Africa unattached, and as such they curiously
threaten the whole imperial program. On the one hand, they arouse
democratic sympathy in homeland which makes it difficult to submerge
them; and again, they are temptations to agitation for freedom and
autonomy on the part of other black and subject populations. What
prophet can tell what world-tempest lurks in these cloud-like shadows?
Then, there is Belgium.</p>
<h2 id="the-shadow-of-belgium">The Shadow of Belgium</h2>
<p>There is a little black man in Belgium, whose name is Mfumu Paul
Panda. He is filled with a certain resentment against me and American
Negroes. He writes me now and then, but fairly spits his letters at
me,—and they are always filled with some defense of Belgium in Africa,
or rather with some accusation against England, France and Portugal
there. I do not blame Panda, although I do not agree with his reasoning.
<span class="pagenum">[390]</span> Unwittingly summer before last I tore
his soul in two. His reason knows that I am right, but his heart denies
his reason. He was nephew and therefore by African custom heir of a
great chief who for thirty years, back to the time of Stanley, has
co-operated with white Belgium. As a child of five, young Panda was
brought home from the Belgian Congo by a Belgian official and given to
his maiden sister. This sister reared the little black boy as her own,
nursed him, dressed him, schooled him and defended against the criticism
of her friends his right to university training. She was his mother, his
friend. He loved her and revered her. She guided and loved him. When the
second Pan-African Congress came to Brussels it found Panda leader of
the small black colony there and spokesman for black Belgium. He had
revisited the Congo and was full of plans for reform. And he thought of
the uplift of his black compatriots in terms of reform. All this the
Pan-African Congress changed. First it brought on his head a storm of
unmerited abuse from the industrial press: we were enemies of Belgium;
we were pensioners of the Bolshevists; we were partisans of England.
Panda hotly defended us until he heard our speeches and read our
resolutions.</p>
<p>The Pan-African Congress revealed itself to him with a new and
unexplicable program. It talked of Africans as intelligent, thinking,
self-directing and voting men. It envisaged an Africa for the Africans
and governed by and for Africans, and it arraigned white Europe,
including Belgium, for nameless and deliberate wrong in Africa. Panda
was perplexed and astonished; and then his white friends and white
mother rushed to the defense of Belgium and blamed him for consorting
with persons with ideas so dangerous and unfair to Belgium. He turned
upon us black folk in complaining wrath. He felt in a sense deceived and
betrayed. He considered us foolishly radical. Belgium was not perfect,
but was far less blood guilty than other European powers. Panda
continues to send me clippings and facts to prove this.</p>
<p>In this last matter he is in a sense right. England and France and
Germany deliberately laid their shadow across Africa. Belgium had Africa
thrust upon her. Bismarck intended <span class="pagenum">[391]</span>
the Congo Free State for Germany and he cynically made vain and foolish
Leopold temporary custodian; and even after Bismarck’s fall, Germany
dreamed of an Africa which should include Congo, half the Portuguese
territory and all the French, making Germany the great and dominant
African power. For this she fought the Great War.</p>
<p>Meantime, and slowly, Belgium became dazzled by the dream of empire.
Africa is but a small part of Britain; Africa is but a half of larger
France. But the Congo is eighty-two times the size of little Belgium,
and at Tervuren, wily Leopold laid a magic mirror—an intriguing flash of
light, a museum set in rare beauty and approached by magnificent
vistas—a flash of revealing knowledge such as no other modern land
possesses of its colonial possessions. The rank and file of the Belgians
were impressed. They dreamed of wealth and glory. They received the
Congo from Leopold as a royal gift—shyly, but with secret pride. What
nation of the world had so wonderful a colony! and Belgium started to
plan its development.</p>
<p>Meantime the same power that exploited the Congo and made red rubber
under Leopold—these same great merchants and bankers—still ruled and
guided the vast territory. Moreover, Belgium, impoverished by war and
conquest, needed revenue as never before. The only difference then
between the new Congo and the old was that a Belgian liberal public
opinion had a right to ask questions and must be informed. Propaganda
intimating that this criticism of Belgium was mainly international
jealousy and that the exploitation of black Belgium would eventually
lower taxes for the whites,—this was nearly enough to leave the old
taskmasters and methods in control in spite of wide plans for eventual
education and reform.</p>
<p>I remember my interview with the socialist Minister for Colonies. He
hesitated to talk with me. He knew what socialism had promised the
worker and what it was unable to do for the African worker, but he told
me his plans for education and uplift. They were fine plans, but they
remain plans even to-day, and the Belgian Congo is still a land of
silence and ignorance, with few schools, with forced industry, with all
<span id="page_392"></span>the land and natural resources taken from the
people and handed over to the State, and the State, so far as Congo is
concerned, ruled well-nigh absolutely by profitable industry. Thus the
African shadow of Belgium gravely and dangerously overshadows that
little land.</p>
<h2 id="the-shadow-of-france">The Shadow of France</h2>
<p>I know two black men in France. One is Candace, black West Indian
deputy, an out-and-out defender of the nation and more French than the
French. The other is René Maran, black Goncourt prize-man and author of
<em>Batouala</em> Maran’s attack on France and on the black French
deputy from Senegal has gone into the courts and marks an era. Never
before have Negroes criticized the work of the French in Africa.</p>
<p>France’s attitude toward black and colored folk is peculiar. England
knows Negroes chiefly as colonial “natives” or as occasional curiosities
on London streets. America knows Negroes mainly as freedmen and
servants. But for nearly two centuries France has known educated and
well-bred persons of Negro descent; they filtered in from the French
West Indies, sons and relatives of French families and recognized as
such under the Code Napoleon, while under English law similar folk were
but nameless bastards. All the great French schools have had black
students here and there; the professions have known many and the fine
arts a few scattered over decades; but all this was enough to make it
impossible to say in France as elsewhere that Negroes cannot be
educated. That is an absurd statement to a Frenchman. It was not that
the French loved or hated Negroes as such; they simply grew to regard
them as men with the possibilities and shortcomings of men, added to an
unusual natural personal appearance.</p>
<p>Then came the war and France needed black men. She recruited them by
every method, by appeal, by deceit, by halfconcealed force. She threw
them ruthlessly into horrible slaughter. She made them “shock” troops.
They walked from the tall palms of Guinea and looked into the mouths of
Krupp guns without hesitation, with scarcely a tremor. France <span
class="pagenum">[393]</span> watched them offer the blood sacrifice for
their adopted motherland with splendid <em>sang-froid,</em> often with
utter abandon.</p>
<p>But for Black Africa, Germany would have overwhelmed France before
American help was in sight. A tremendous wave of sentiment toward black
folk welled up in the French heart. And back of this sentiment came fear
for the future, not simply fear of Germany reborn but fear of changing
English interests, fear of unstable America. What Africa did for France
in military protection she could easily repeat on a vaster scale;
wherefore France proposes to protect herself in future from military
aggression by using half a million or more of trained troops from
yellow, brown and black Africa. France has 40,000,000 Frenchmen and
60,000,000 Colonials. Of these Colonials, 845,000 served in France
during the war, of whom 535,000 were soldiers and 310,000 in labor
contingents. Of the soldiers, 440,000 came from North and West Africa.
The peace footing of the French army is now 660,000, to whom must be
added 189,000 Colonial troops. With three years’ service and seven
years’ reserve, France hopes in ten years’ time to have 400,000 trained
Colonial troops and 450,000 more ready to be trained. These Colonial
troops will serve part of their time in France.</p>
<p>This program brings France face to face with the problem of
democratic rule in her colonies. French industry has had wide experience
in the manipulation of democracy at home, but her colonial experience is
negligible. Legally, of course, the colonies are part of France.
Theoretically colonials are French citizens and already the blacks of
the French West Indies and the yellows and browns of North Africa are so
recognized and represented in Parliament. Four towns of Senegal have
similar representation; but beyond this matters hesitate.</p>
<p>All this brings, however, both political and economic difficulties.
Diagne, black deputy from Senegal, was expelled from the Socialist party
because he had made no attempt to organize a branch of the party in his
district. And the whole colonial bloc stand outside the interests of
home political parties, while these parties know little of the
particular local demands of the colonies. As this situation develops
there will come <span class="pagenum">[394]</span> the question of the
practicality of ruling a world nation with one law-making body. And if
devolution of power takes place what will be the relation of
self-governing colonies to the mother country?</p>
<p>But beyond this more or less nebulous theory looms the immediately
practical problem of French industry. The French nation and French
private industry have invested huge sums in African colonies,
considering black Africa alone. Dakar is a modern city superimposed on a
native market place. Its public buildings, its vast harbor, its traffic
are imposing. Conakry has miles of warehouses beneath its beautiful
palms. No European country is so rapidly extending its African
railways—one may ride from St. Louis over halfway to Timbuktu and from
Dakar 1,500 miles to the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
<p>The question is, then, will France be able to make her colonies
paying industrial investments and at the same time centers for such a
new birth of Negro civilization and freedom as will attach to France the
mass of black folk in unswerving loyalty and will to sacrifice. Such a
double possibility is to-day by no means clear. French industry is
fighting to-day a terrific battle in Europe for the hegemony of reborn
Central Europe. The present probabilities are that the future spread of
the industrial imperialism of the West will be largely under French
leadership. French and Latin imperialism in industry will depend on
alliance with western Asia, northern and central Africa, with the Congo
rather than the Mediterranean as the southern boundary. Suppose that
this new Latin imperialism emerging from the Great War developed a new
antithesis to English imperialism where blacks and browns and yellows,
subdued, cajoled and governed by white men, form a laboring proletariat
subject to a European white democracy which industry controls; suppose
that, contrary to this, Latin Europe should evolve political control
with black men and the Asiatics having a real voice in Colonial
government, while both at home and in the colonies democracy in industry
continued to progress; what would this cost? It would mean, of course,
nothing less than the giving up of the idea of an exclusive White Man’s
World. It would be a revolt and a tremendous <span
class="pagenum">[395]</span> revolt against the solidarity of the West
in opposition to the South and East. France moving along this line would
perforce carry Italy, Portugal and Spain with it, and it is the fear of
such a possible idea that explains the deep-seated resentment against
France on the part of England and America. It is not so much the
attitude of France toward Germany that frightens white Europe, as her
apparent flaunting of the white fetish. The plans of those who would
build a world of white men have always assumed the ultimate acquiescence
of the colored world in the face of their military power and industrial
efficiency, because of the darker world’s lack of unity and babel of
tongues and wide cleft of religious differences. If now one part of the
white world bids for dark support by gifts of at least partial manhood
rights, the remainder of the white world scents treason and remains grim
and unyielding in its heart. But is it certain that France is going to
follow this program?</p>
<p>I walked through the native market at St. Louis in French Senegal—a
busy, colorful scene. There was wonderful work in gold filigree and in
leather, all kinds of beads and bracelets and fish and foods.
Mohammedans salaamed at sunset, black- veiled Moorish women glided like
somber ghosts with living eyes; mighty black men in pale burnooses
strode by,—it was all curious, exotic, alluring. And yet I could not see
quite the new thing that I was looking for. There was no color line
particularly visible and yet there was all the raw material for it. Most
of the white people were in command holding government office and
getting large incomes. Most of the colored and black folk were laborers
with small incomes. In the fashionable cafés you seldom saw colored
folk, but you did see them now and then and no one seemed to object.
There were schools, good schools, but they fell short of anything like
universal education for the natives. White and colored school children
ran and played together, but the great mass of children were not in
school.</p>
<p>As I looked more narrowly, what seemed to be happening was this: the
white Frenchmen were exploiting black Africans in practically the same
way as white Englishmen, but they had not yet erected or tried to erect
caste lines. Consequently, into <span class="pagenum">[396]</span> the
ranks of the exploiters there arose continually black men and mulattoes,
but these dark men were also exploiters. They had the psychology of the
exploiters. They looked upon the mass of people as means of wealth. The
mass therefore had no leadership. There was no one in the colony except
the unrisen and undeveloped blacks who thought of the colony as
developing and being developed for its own sake and for the sake of the
mass of the people there. Everyone of intelligence thought that Senegal
was being developed for the sake of France and inevitably they tended to
measure its development by the amount of profit.</p>
<p>If this sort of thing goes on will not France find herself in the
same profit-taking colonial industry as England? Indeed, unless she
follows English methods in African colonies can she compete with England
in the amount of profit made, and if she does not make profit out of her
colonies how long will her industrial masters submit without tremendous
industrial returns? Or if these industrial returns come, what will be
the plight of black French Africa? <em>Batouala</em> voices it. In the
depths of the French Congo one finds the same exploitation of black folk
as in the Belgian Congo or British West Africa. The only mitigation is
that here and there in the Civil Service are black Frenchmen like René
Maran who can speak out; but they seldom do.</p>
<p>For the most part, as I have said, in French Africa, educated
Africans are Europeans. But if education goes far and develops in Africa
a change in this respect must come. For this, France has a complete
theoretical system of education beginning with the African village and
going up to the colleges and technical schools at Goree. But at present
it is, of course, only a plan and the merest skeleton of accomplishment.
On the picturesque island of Goree whose ancient ramparts face modern
and commercial Dakar I saw two or three hundred fine black boys of high
school rank gathered in from all Senegal by competitive tests and taught
thoroughly by excellent French teachers in accordance with a curriculum
which, as far as it went, was equal to that of any European school; its
graduates could enter the higher schools of France. A few hundred
students <span class="pagenum">[397]</span> out of a black population of
nineteen millions is certainly but a start. This development will call
for money and trained guidance and will interfere with industry. It is
not likely that the path will be followed and followed fast unless black
French leaders encourage and push France, unless they see the pitfalls
of American and English race leadership and bring the black apostle to
devote himself to race uplift not by the compulsion of outer hate but by
the lure of inner vision.</p>
<p>As yet I see few signs of this. I have walked in Paris with Diagne
who represents Senegal—all Senegal, white and black,—in the French
parliament. But Diagne is a Frenchman who is accidentally black. I
suspect Diagne rather despises his own black Wolofs. I have talked with
Candace, black deputy of Guadaloupe. Candace is virulently French. He
has no conception of Negro uplift, as apart from French development. One
black deputy alone, Boisneuf of Martinique, has the vision. His voice
rings in parliament. He made the American soldiers keep their hands off
the Senegalese. He made the governor of Congo apologize and explain; he
made Poincaré issue that extraordinary warning against American
prejudice. Is Boisneuf an exception or a prophecy?</p>
<p>One looks on present France and her African shadow, then, as standing
at the parting of tremendous ways; one way leads toward democracy for
black as well as white—a thorny way made more difficult by the organized
greed of the imperial profit-takers within and without the nation; the
other road is the way of the white world, and of its contradictions and
dangers, English colonies may tell.</p>
<h2 id="the-shadow-of-england">The Shadow of England</h2>
<p>I landed in Sierra Leone last January. The great Mountain of the Lion
crouched above us, its green sides trimmed with the pretty white villas
of the whites, while black town sweltered below. Despite my diplomatic
status I was haled before the police and in the same room where
criminals were examined I was put through the sharpest grilling I ever
met in a presumably civilized land. Why? I was a black American <span
class="pagenum">[398]</span> and the English fear black folk who have
even tasted freedom. Everything that America has done crudely and
shamelessly to suppress the Negro, England in Sierra Leone has done
legally and suavely so that the Negroes themselves sometimes doubt the
evidence of their own senses: segregation, disfranchisement, trial
without jury, over-taxation, “Jim Crow” cars, neglect of education,
economic serfdom. Yet all this can be and is technically denied.
Segregation? “Oh no,” says the colonial official, “anyone can live where
he will—only that beautiful and cool side of the mountain with fine
roads, golf and tennis and bungalows is assigned to government
officials.” Are there black officials? “Oh yes, and they can be assigned
residences there, too.” But they never have been. The Negroes vote and
hold office in Freetown—I met the comely black and cultured mayor—but
Freetown has almost no revenues and its powers have been gradually
absorbed by the autocratic white colonial government which has five
million dollars a year to spend. Any government prosecutor can abolish
trial by jury in any case with the consent of the judge, and all judges
are white. White officials ride in special railway carriages and I am
morally certain—I cannot prove it—that more is spent by the government
on tennis and golf in the colony than on popular education.</p>
<p>These things, and powerful efforts of English industry to reap every
penny of profit for England in colonial trade, leaving the black
inhabitants in helpless serfdom, have aroused West Africa, and aroused
it at this time because of two things—the war, and cocoa in Nigeria. The
burden of war fell hard on black and British West Africa. Their troops
conquered German Africa for England and France at bitter cost and helped
hold back the Turk. Yet there was not a single black officer in the
British army or a single real reward save citations and new and drastic
taxation even on exports.</p>
<p>But British West Africa had certain advantages. After the decline of
the slave trade and before the discovery that slavery and serfdom in
Africa could be made to pay more than the removal of the laboring forces
to other parts of the world, there was a disposition to give over to the
natives the black colonies <span class="pagenum">[399]</span> on the
fever coast and the British Government announced the intention of
gradually preparing West Africans for self-government. Missionary
education and the sending of black students to England raised a small
Negro intelligentsia which long struggled to place itself at the head of
affairs. It had some success but lacked an economic foundation. When the
new industrial imperialism swept Africa, with England in the lead, the
presence of these educated black leaders was a thorn in the flesh of the
new English industrialists. Their method was to crowd these leaders
aside into narrower and narrower confines as we have seen in Sierre
Leone. But the Negroes in the older colonies retained possession of
their land and, suddenly, when the cocoa industry was transferred from
Portuguese Africa, they gained in one or two colonies a new and
undreamed of economic foundation. Instead of following the large
plantation industry, cocoa became the product of the small individual
native farm. In 1891 a native sold eighty pounds of the first cocoa
raised on the Gold Coast. By 1911 this had increased to 45,000 tons and
in 1916 to 72,000 tons. In Nigeria there has also been a large increase,
making these colonies to-day the greatest cocoa producing countries in
the world.</p>
<p>Moreover, this progress showed again the new democratic problems of
colonization, since it began and was fostered by a certain type of white
colonial official who was interested in the black man and wanted him to
develop. But this official was interested in the primitive black and not
in the educated black. He feared and despised the educated West African
and did not believe him capable of leading his primitive brother. He
sowed seeds of dissension between the two. On the other hand, the
educated West African hated the white colonial leader as a supplanter
and deceiver whose ultimate aims must be selfish and wrong; and as ever,
between these two, the English exploiting company worked gradually its
perfect will.</p>
<p>Determined effort was thus made by the English, both merchants and
philanthropists, to cut the natives off from any union of forces or of
interests with the educated West Africans. “Protectorates” under
autocratic white rule were attached to <span
class="pagenum">[400]</span> the colonies and the natives in the
protectorates were threatened with loss of land, given almost no
education and left to the mercy of a white colonial staff whose chief
duty gradually came to be the encouragement of profitable industry for
the great companies. These companies were represented in the governing
councils, they influenced appointments at home and especially they
spread in England a carefully prepared propaganda which represented the
educated “nigger” as a bumptious, unreasoning fool in a silk hat, while
the untutored and unspoiled native under white control was nature’s
original nobleman. Also they suggested that this “white” control must
not admit too many visionaries and idealists.</p>
<p>This policy has not been altogether successful, for the educated
Negro is appealing to English democracy and the native is beginning to
seek educated black leadership. After many vicissitudes, in 1920 a
Congress of West Africa was assembled on the Gold Coast, and from this a
delegation was sent to London “to lay before His Majesty the King in
Council through the colonial ministry certain grievances.” This was an
epoch-making effort and, as was natural, the Colonial Office, where
imperial industry is entrenched, refused to recognize the delegation,
claiming that they did not really represent black West Africa.
Nevertheless, through the League of Nations Union and the public press
this delegation succeeded in putting its case before the world. They
described themselves as “of that particular class of peaceful citizens
who, apprehensive of the culminating danger resulting from the present
political unrest in West Africa—an unrest which is silently moving
throughout the length and breadth of that continent—and also
appreciating the fact that the present system of administration will
inevitably lead to a serious deadlock between the ‘Government and the
Governed,’ decided to set themselves to the task of ameliorating this
pending disaster by putting forward constitutionally a program, the
carrying of which into operation will alleviate all pains and
misgivings.”</p>
<p>The final resolutions of the Congress said, “that in the opinion of
this Conference the time has arrived for a change in the Constitution of
several British West African colonies, so <span
class="pagenum">[401]</span> as to give the people an effective voice in
their affairs both in the Legislative and Municipal Governments, and
that the Conference pledges itself to submit proposals for such
reforms.”</p>
<p>The reasons for this demand are thus described:</p>
<p>“In the demand for the franchise by the people of British West
Africa, it is not to be supposed that they are asking to be allowed to
copy a foreign institution. On the contrary, it is important to notice
that the principle of electing representatives to local councils and
bodies is inherent in all the systems of British West Africa. . . . From
the foregoing it is obvious that a system by which the Governor of a
Crown Colony nominates whom he thinks proper to represent the people is
considered by them as a great anomaly and constitutes a grievance and a
disability which they now request should be remedied.”</p>
<p>Never before has black Britain spoken so clearly or so cogently. For
the most part the African population of the empire has been silent.</p>
<p>Since the war not only has West Africa thus spoken but the colored
West Indies have complained. They want Home Rule and they are demanding
it. They asked after the war: Why was it that no black man sat in the
Imperial Conference? Why is it that one of the oldest parts of the
empire lingers in political serfdom to England and industrial bondage to
America? Why is there not a great British West Indian Federation,
stretching from Bermuda to Honduras and Guiana, and ranking with the
free dominions? The answer was clear and concise—Color.</p>
<p>In 1916 a new agitation for representative government began in
Granada. The fire spread to all the West Indies and in 1921 a delegation
was received by the Colonial Office in London at the same time that the
Second Pan-African Congress was in session.</p>
<p>Here were unusual appeals to English democracy—appeals that not even
commercial propaganda could wholly hush. But there was a force that
curiously counteracted them. Liberal England, wanting world peace and
fearing French militarism, backed by the English thrift that is
interested in the restored economic equilibrium, found as one of its
most prominent <span class="pagenum">[402]</span> spokesmen Jan Smuts of
South Africa, and Jan Smuts stands for the suppression of the
blacks.</p>
<p>Jan Smuts is to-day, in his world aspects, the greatest protagonist
of the white race. He is fighting to take control of Laurenço Marques
from a nation that recognizes, even though it does not realize, the
equality of black folk; he is fighting to keep India from political and
social equality in the empire; he is fighting to insure the continued
and eternal subordination of black to white in Africa; and he is
fighting for peace and good will in a white Europe which can by union
present a united front to the yellow, brown and black worlds. In all
this he expresses bluntly, and yet not without finesse, what a powerful
host of white folk believe but do not plainly say in Melbourne, New
Orleans, San Francisco, Hongkong, Berlin, and London.</p>
<p>The words of Smuts in the recent Imperial Conference were transcribed
as follows: “The tendencies in South Africa, just as elsewhere, were all
democratic. If there was to be equal manhood suffrage over the Union,
the whites would be swamped by the blacks. A distinction could not be
made between Indians and Africans. They would be impelled by the
inevitable force of logic to go the whole hog, and the result would be
that not only would the whites be swamped in Natal by the Indians but
the whites would be swamped all over South Africa by the blacks and the
whole position for which the whites had striven for two hundred years or
more now would be given up. So far as South Africa was concerned,
therefore, it was a question of impossibility. For white South Africa it
was not a question of dignity but a question of existence.”</p>
<p>Back of all these attitudes is Fear. Back of the whole British
Imperial Conference was fear. The worlds of color to-day are curiously
and nicely balanced—a little push here, a little yielding there and the
end of the vast resulting movements may be anything. The dominating
thing in that Conference was the fear of the colored world.</p>
<p>This almost naïve setting of the darker races beyond the pale of
democracy and of modern humanity was listened to with sympathetic
attention in England. It is without doubt <span
class="pagenum">[403]</span> to-day the dominant policy of the British
Empire. Can this policy be carried out? It involves two
things—acquiescence of the darker peoples and agreement between capital
and labor in white democracies.</p>
<p>This agreement between capital and labor in regard to colored folk
cannot be depended on. First of all, no sooner is colored labor duly
subordinate, voiceless in government, efficient for the purpose and
cheap, than the division of the resultant profit is a matter of dispute.
This is the case even in South Africa and it came as a singular answer
to Smuts. In South Africa white labor is highly paid, can vote, and by a
system of black helpers occupies an easy and powerful position. It can
only retain this position by vigorously excluding blacks from certain
occupations and by beating their wages down to the lowest point even
when as helpers they are really doing the prohibited work. It is to the
manifest interest of capitalists and investors to breach if not
overthrow this caste wall and thus secure higher profits by cheaper and
more pliable labor. Already South African courts are slowly moving
toward mitigating the law of labor caste and in retaliation the white
labor unions have joined Smuts’ political enemies, the English-hating
Boer party of independence, and have overthrown the great premier.</p>
<p>But how curious are these bedfellows—English capital and African
black labor against Dutch home-rulers and the trades unions. The
combinations are as illogical as they are thought- producing, for after
all if South Africa is really bent on independence she must make
economic and political peace with the blacks; and if she hates Negroes
more than she hates low wages she must submit even more than now to
English rule.</p>
<p>Now what is English rule over colored folk destined to be? Here comes
the second puzzling result of the Smuts philosophy. I was in London on
the night of the Guild Hall banquet when the Prime Minister spoke on
“Empire Policy and World Peace” and gave a sort of summing up of the
work of the Imperial Conference. It was significant that in the
forefront of his words, cheek by jowl with Imperial “foreign policy,”
stood the “intensity of feeling in India on the question of the <span
class="pagenum">[404]</span> status of British Indians in the Empire.”
What indeed could be more fundamental than this in the building of world
peace? Are the brown Indians to share equally in the ruling of the
British Empire or are they an inferior race? And curiously enough, the
battle on this point is impending not simply in the unchecked movement
toward “swaraj” in India but in Africa—in the Union of South Africa and
in Kenya.</p>
<p>In South Africa, despite all Imperial explanations and attempts to
smooth things out, Smuts and the Boers have taken firm ground: Indians
are to be classed with Negroes in their social and political exclusion.
South Africa is to be ruled by its minority of whites. But if this is
blunt and unswerving, how much more startling is Kenya. Kenya is the
British East Africa of pre-war days and extends from the Indian Ocean to
the Victoria Nyanza and from German East Africa to Ethiopia. It is that
great roof of the African world where, beneath the silver heads of the
Mountains of the Moon, came down in ancient days those waters and races
which founded Egypt. The descendant races still live there with fine
physique and noble heads—the Masai warriors whom Schweinfurth heralded,
the Dinka, the Galla, and Nile Negroes—the herdsmen and primitive
artisans of the beautiful highlands. Here was a land largely untainted
by the fevers of the tropics and here England proposed to send her sick
and impoverished soldiers of the war. Following the lead of South
Africa, she took over five million acres of the best lands from the
3,000,000 natives, herded them gradually toward the swamps and gave
them, even there, no sure title; then by taxation she forced sixty per
cent of the black adults into working for the ten thousand white owners
for the lowest wage. Here was opportunity not simply for the great
landholder and slave- driver but also for the small trader, and
twenty-four thousand Indians came. These Indians claimed the rights of
free subjects of the empire—a right to buy land, a right to exploit
labor, a right to a voice in the government now confined to the handful
of whites.</p>
<p>Suddenly a great race conflict swept East Africa—orient and occident,
white, brown and black, landlord, trader and landless <span
class="pagenum">[405]</span> serf. When the Indians asked rights, the
whites replied that this would injure the rights of the natives.
Immediately the natives began to awake. Few of them were educated but
they began to form societies and formulate grievances. A black political
consciousness arose for the first time in Kenya. Immediately the Indians
made a bid for the support of this new force and asked rights and
privileges for all British subjects—white, brown and black. As the
Indian pressed his case, white South Africa rose in alarm. If the Indian
became a recognized man, landholder and voter in Kenya, what of
Natal?</p>
<p>The British Government speculated and procrastinated and then
announced its decision: East Africa was primarily a “trusteeship” for
the Africans and not for the Indians. The Indians, then, must be
satisfied with limited industrial and political rights, while for the
black native—the white Englishman spoke! A conservative Indian leader,
speaking in England after this decision, said that if the Indian problem
in South Africa were allowed to fester much longer it would pass beyond
the bounds of domestic issue and would become a question of foreign
policy upon which the unity of the Empire might founder irretrievably.
The Empire could never keep its colored races within it by force, he
said, but only by preserving and safeguarding their sentiments.</p>
<p>Perhaps this shrewd Kenya decision was too shrewd. It preserved white
control of Kenya but it said in effect: “Africa for the Africans!” What
then about Uganda and the Sudan, where a black leadership exists under
ancient forms; and, above all, what about the educated black leadership
in the West Indies and West Africa? Why should black West Africa with
its industrial triumphs like Nigeria be content forever with a Crown
Government, if Africa is for the Africans?</p>
<p>The result has been a yielding by England to the darker world—not a
yielding of much, but yielding. India is to have a revision of the
impossible “diarachy”; all West Africa is to have a small elective
element in its governing councils; and even the far West Indies have
been visited by a colonial undersecretary and parliamentary committee,
the first of its kind in <span class="pagenum">[406]</span> the long
history of the islands. Their report is worth quoting in part: “Several
reasons combine to make it likely that the common demand for a measure
of representative government will in the long run prove irresistible.
The wave of democratic sentiment has been powerfully stimulated by the
war. Education is rapidly spreading and tending to produce a colored and
black intelligentsia of which the members are quick to absorb elements
of knowledge requisite for entry into learned professions and return
from travel abroad with minds emancipated and enlarged, ready to devote
time and energy to propaganda among their own people.”</p>
<p>Egypt too is Africa and the Bilad-es-Sudan, Land of the Blacks, has
in its eastern reaches belonged to Egypt ever since Egypt belonged to
the Sudan—ever since the Pharaohs bowed to the Lords of Meroe. Fifty
times England has promised freedom and independence to Egypt and to-day
she keeps her word by seizing the Sudan with a million square miles, six
million black folk and twenty million dollars of annual revenue. But
Egypt without the Sudan can never be free and independent and this
England well knows, but she will hold the Sudan against Egypt as
“trustee” for the blacks. That was a fateful step that the new
Conservatives took after the Sirdar was murdered by hot revolutionists.
Its echo will long haunt the world.</p>
<p>If now England is literally forced to yield some measure of
self-government to her darker colonies; if France remains steadfast in
the way in which her feet seem to be tending; if Asia arises from the
dead and can no longer be rendered impotent by the opium of
international finance, what will happen to imperialistic world industry
as exemplified in the great expansion of the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries?</p>
<h2 id="labor-in-the-shadows">Labor in the Shadows</h2>
<p>This is the question that faces the new labor parties of the
world—the new political organizations which are determined to force a
larger measure of democracy in industry than now obtains. The trade
union labor movement dominant in Australia, South Africa and the United
States has been hitherto <span class="pagenum">[407]</span> autocratic
and at heart capitalistic, believing in profit-making industry and
wishing only to secure a larger share of profits for particular guilds.
But the larger labor movement following the war envisages through
democratic political action real democratic power of the mass of workers
in industry and commerce. Two questions here arise: Will the new labor
parties welcome the darker race to this industrial democracy? And, if
they do, how will this affect industry?</p>
<p>The attitude of the white laborer toward colored folk is largely a
matter of long continued propaganda and gossip. The white laborers can
read and write, but beyond this their education and experience are
limited and they live in a world of color prejudice. The curious, most
childish propaganda dominates us, by which good, earnest, even
intelligent men have come by millions to believe almost religiously that
white folk are a peculiar and chosen people whose one great
accomplishment is civilization and that civilization must be protected
from the rest of the world by cheating, stealing, lying, and murder. The
propaganda, the terrible, ceaseless propaganda that buttresses this
belief day by day—the propaganda of poet and novelist, the uncanny
welter of romance, the half knowledge of scientists, the pseudo-science
of statesmen—all these, united in the myth of mass inferiority of most
men, have built a wall which many centuries will not break down. Born
into such a spiritual world, the average white worker is absolutely at
the mercy of its beliefs and prejudices. Color hate easily assumes the
form of a religion and the laborer becomes the blind executive of the
decrees of the masters of the white world; he votes armies and navies
for “punitive” expeditions; he sends his sons as soldiers and sailors;
he composes the Negro-hating mob, demands Japanese exclusion and lynches
untried prisoners. What hope is there that such a mass of dimly thinking
and misled men will ever demand universal democracy for all men?</p>
<p>The chief hope lies in the gradual but inevitable spread of the
knowledge that the denial of democracy in Asia and Africa hinders its
complete realization in Europe. It is this that makes the Color Problem
and the Labor Problem to so<span class="pagenum">[408]</span> great an
extent two sides of the same human tangle. How far does white labor see
this? Not far, as yet. Its attitude toward colored labor varies from the
Russian extreme to the extreme in South Africa and Australia. Russia has
been seeking a <em>rapprochement</em> with colored labor. She is making
her peace with China and Japan. Her leaders have come in close touch
with the leaders of India. Claude McKay, an American Negro poet
travelling in Russia, declares: “Lenin himself grappled with the
question of the American Negroes and spoke on the subject before the
Second Congress of the Third International. He consulted with John Reed,
the American journalist, and dwelt on the urgent necessity of propaganda
and organization work among the Negroes of the South.”</p>
<p>Between these extremes waver the white workers of the rest of the
world. On the whole they still lean rather toward the attitude of South
Africa than that of Russia. They exclude colored labor from empty
Australia. They sit in armed truce against them in America where the
Negroes are forcing their way into ranks of union labor by breaking
strikes and underbidding them in wage.</p>
<p>It is precisely by these tactics, however, and by hindering the
natural flow of labor toward the highest wage and the best conditions in
the world that white labor is segregating colored labor in just those
parts of the world where it can be most easily exploited by white
capital and thus giving white capital the power to rule all labor, white
and black, in the rest of the world. White labor is beginning dimly to
see this. Colored labor knows it, and as colored labor becomes more
organized and more intelligent it is going to spread this grievance
through the white world.</p>
<h2 id="the-shadow-of-shadows">The Shadow of Shadows</h2>
<p>How much intelligent organization is there for this purpose on the
part of the colored world? So far there is very little. For while the
colored people of to-day are common victims of white culture, there is a
vast gulf between the red-black South and the yellow-brown East. In the
East long since, centuries <span class="pagenum">[409]</span> ago, there
were mastered a technique and philosophy which still stand among the
greatest the world has known; and the black and African South, beginning
in the dim dawn of time when beginnings were everything, have evolved a
physique and an art, a will to be and to enjoy, which the world has
never done without and never can. But these cultures have little in
common, either to-day or yesterday, and are being pounded together
artificially and not attracting each other naturally. And yet quickened
India, the South and West African Congresses, the Pan-African movement,
the National Association for the advancement of Colored People in
America, together with rising China and risen Japan—all these at no
distant day may come to common consciousness of aim and be able to give
to the labor parties of the world a message that they will
understand.</p>
<p>After all, the darker world realizes the industrial triumphs of white
Europe—its labor-saving devices, its harnessing of vast radical forces,
its conquest of time and space by goods- production, railway, telephone,
telegraph and flying machine, it sees how the world might enjoy these
things and how it does not, how it is enslaved by its own ingenuity,
mechanized by its own machinery. It sees Western civilization
spiritually bankrupt and unhappy.</p>
<p>Africa is happy. The masses of its black folk are calmly contented,
save where what is called “European” civilization has touched and
uprooted them. They have a philosophy of life logical and realizable.
Their children are carefully educated for the life they are to lead.
There are no prostitutes, there is no poverty. In Asia too (although
here I speak by hearsay, knowing Asiatics but not Asia) there is, over
vast spiritual areas, peace and self-realization; a certain completeness
of individual life; a worship of beauty even among the masses; adequate
handling of matter for certain personal ends and satisfactions, and a
religious spirit which is neither hypocritical nor unbelieving. On the
other hand <em>Africa</em> and Asia have no command of technique or
mastery of physical force that can compare with that of the West; they
know practically nothing of mass-time production and their knowledge
<span class="pagenum">[410]</span> of the facts of the universe is far
behind modern knowledge.</p>
<p>That comfort is necessary to complete human happiness, who can for a
moment doubt? But what shall the world pay for this completeness—what is
it paying now? First of all, it has in the heyday of its triumph been
able or willing to supply comfort but to a minority of its own
population. The majority of the whole people of Europe have poor food,
inadequate clothing, bad shelter, inadequate amusement and misleading
education. They are more comfortable than the African savages only in
their water supply, their foods and their opportunity to look at
brilliantly lighted streets.</p>
<p>To save then this efficient organization of work, this
synchronization of human industrial effort the like of which the world
never before saw—to save this, and led by the idea that at all hazards
it must be saved, white Western Europe has long been united in a
determination to make the colored worlds contribute to its comfort,
subordinate themselves to its interests, become part of its machine. It
argues that on this path alone lies salvation for the lazy South and the
sleepy East; that upon them lies the salvation of the world ; and they
ignore with perfect ignorance the possibility that lazy enjoyment and
silent contemplation of life, without a surplus or even a sufficiency of
modern comfort may for a moment be held an end and ideal of existence;
or that the efficient West and North can learn of the lazy South and
sleepy East.</p>
<p>If now the world, and particularly the laboring world, should come to
realize that industrial efficiency as measured by the amount of goods
made and the size of the private profit derived therefrom is not the
greatest thing in the world; and that by exchanging European efficiency
for African leisure and Asiatic contemplation they might gain
tremendously in happiness, the world might be less afraid to give up
economic imperialism. Moreover, future economic imperialism can only be
held together by militarism. Militarism is costly and to increasing
masses of men since the Great War, hateful; more than this—the darker
world is held in subjection to Europe by its own darker soldiers. Africa
is owned and held almost entirely by Europe; but at the same time Africa
is held and kept in<span class="pagenum">[411]</span> subjection to
Europe by black troops; black troops in the Sudan, black troops in
French Africa, black troops in British West Africa, black troops in
Belgian Congo, black troops in Italian Africa, black troops in Kenya, in
Uganda, and in former German Africa. Mutual jealousies, widespread
ignorance, tribal hatreds and red uniforms make this to-day a most
effective method of military control. But for how many years can this be
depended upon? Indian soldiers hold India in subjection to England and
France. They cannot always be expected to do this. Some day they are
bound to awake.</p>
<p>Above all this rises the shadow of two international groups—the Jews
and the modern Negroes. The Jews are, in blood, Spanish, German, French,
Arabian and American. Their ancient unity of religious faith is
crumbling, but out of it all has come a spiritual unity born of
suffering, prejudice and industrial power which can be used and is being
used to spread an international consciousness. Where this spirit
encounters a rampant new nationalism as in Poland or bitter memories of
national loss as in Germany, or racial bigotry as in America, it stirs
an Anti-Semitism as cruel as it is indefinite and armed in fact not
against an abused race but against any spirit that works or seems to
work for the union of human kind.</p>
<p>And toward this same great end a new group of groups is setting its
face. Pan-Africanism as a living movement, a tangible accomplishment, is
a little and negligible thing. But there are twenty-three millions of
Negroes in British West Africa, eighteen millions in French Africa,
eleven millions and more in the United States; between eight and nine
millions each in the Belgian Congo and Portuguese Africa; and a dozen
other lands in Africa and America have groups ranging from two to five
millions. This hundred and fifty millions of people are gaining slowly
an intelligent thoughtful leadership. The main seat of their leadership
is to-day the United States.</p>
<p>In the United States there are certain unheralded indications of
development in the Negro problem. One is the fact that for the first
time in America, the American Negro is to-day universally recognized as
capable of speaking for himself. To realize the significance of this one
has but to remember that<span class="pagenum">[412]</span> less than
twenty-five years ago a conference of friends of the Negro could meet at
Lake Mohonk to discuss his problems without a single Negro present. And
even later than that, great magazines could publish symposiums on the
“Negro” problem without thinking of inviting a single Negro to
participate. Again, a revolution is happening under our eyes with regard
to lynching. For forty years, not less than a Negro a week and sometimes
as many as five a week have been lynched in order to enforce race
inferiority by terrorism. Suddenly this number in 1923 was cut in half
and it looks as though the record of 1924 was going to be not more than
one Negro lynched each month and all this was due primarily to the
tremendous onslaught of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People against lynching and their broad-casting of the
facts.</p>
<p>Finally and just as important is the new national policy as to
immigration, born of war. This policy is seemingly a tremendous triumph
of the “Nordics” and not only cuts down the foreign immigration to the
United States from 1,000,000 a year to 160,000, but also seeks to
exclude the Latins and Jews and openly to insult Asiatics. Now despite
the inhumanity of this, American Negroes are silently elated at this
policy. As long as the northern lords of industry could import cheap,
white labor from Europe they could encourage the color line in industry
and leave the Negroes as peons and serfs at the mercy of the white
South. But to-day with the cutting down of foreign immigration the Negro
becomes the best source of cheap labor for the industries of the white
land. The bidding for his services gives him a tremendous sword to wield
against the Bourbon South and by means of wholesale migration he is
wielding it. But note again the extraordinary bed fellows involved in
this paradox; Negro laborers, white capitalists and “Nordic” fanatics
against Latin Europe, Southern task masters, labor unions, the Jews and
Japanese!</p>
<p>Led by American Negroes, the Negroes of the world are reaching out
hands toward each other to know, to sympathize, to inquire. There are
few countries without their few Negroes, few great cities without its
groups, and thus with this <span class="pagenum">[413]</span> great
human force, spread out as it is in all lands and languages, the world
must one day reckon. We face, then, in the modern black American, the
black West Indian, the black Frenchman, the black Portuguese, the black
Spaniard and the black African a man gaining in knowledge and power and
in the definite aim to end color slavery and give black folk a knowledge
of modern culture.</p>
<p>There are those who see in the movement only danger—only the silly
agitation of would-be fomenters of trouble. They discount it, laugh at
it and secretly and openly obstruct it. When the Pan-African Congress
planned to meet in Brussels all the industrial exploiters of the Belgian
Congo united to misrepresent its objects, distort its actions and punish
its local supporters. When the same Congress met in France strong
pressure was exerted to keep it from any interference with the
investments of French capital in Africa. When the Congress met in
England it was dubbed “French” in sympathy and anarchistic in tendency.
And yet slowly but surely the movement grows and the day faintly dawns
when the new force for international understanding and racial
readjustment will and must be felt.</p>
<hr>
<p>To some persons—to more human beings than ever before at one time in
the world’s history, there came during the Great War, during those
terrible years of 1917 and 1918, a vision of the Glory of Sacrifice, a
dream of a world greater, sweeter, more beautiful and more honest than
ever before; a world without war, without poverty and without hate.</p>
<p>I am glad it came. Even though it was a mirage it was eternally true.
To-day some faint shadow of it comes to me again.</p>
<p>My ship seeks Africa. Ten days we crept across the Atlantic; five
days we sail to the Canaries. And then turning we sought the curve of
that mighty and fateful shoulder of gigantic Africa. Slowly, slowly we
creep down the coast in a little German cargo boat. Yonder behind the
horizon is Cape Bojador whence in 1441 came the brown Moors and black
Moors who through the slave trade built America and<span
class="pagenum">[414]</span> modern commerce and let loose the furies of
the world. Another day afar we glide past Dakar, city and center of
French Senegal. Thereupon we fall down, down to the burning equator past
the Guinea and Gambia, to where the Lion mountain glares, toward the
vast gulf whose sides are lined with Silver and Gold and Ivory. And now
we stand before Liberia; Liberia that is a little thing set upon a
Hill;—thirty or forty thousand square miles and two million folk; but it
represents to me the world. Here political power has tried to resist the
power of modern capital. It has not yet succeeded, but its partial
failure is not because the republic is black, but because the world has
failed in this same battle; because organized industry owns and rules
England, France, Germany, America and Heaven. And can Liberia escape the
power that rules the world? I do not know; but I do know unless the
world escapes, the world as well as Liberia will die; and if Liberia
lives it will be because the World is reborn as in that vision splendid
of 1918.</p>
<p>And thus again in 1924 as in 1899 I seem to see the problem of the
20th century as the Problem of the Color Line.</p>
