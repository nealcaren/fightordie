<hr>


<p><span class="pagenum">[369]</span> Throughout the years of history,
woman has been the weather-vane, the indicator, showing in which
direction the wind of destiny blows. Her status and development have
augured now calm and stability, now swift currents of progress. What
then is to be said of the Negro woman of to-day, whose problems are of
such import to her race?</p>
<p>A study of her contributions to any one community, throughout
America, would illuminate the pathway being trod by her people. There
is, however, an advantage in focusing upon the women of Harlem—modern
city in the world’s metropolis. Here, more than anywhere else, the Negro
woman is free from the cruder handicaps of primitive household hardships
and the grosser forms of sex and race subjugation. Here, she has
considerable opportunity to measure her powers in the intellectual and
industrial fields of the great city. The questions naturally arise:
“What are her difficulties?” and, “How is she solving them?”</p>
<p>To answer these questions, one must have in mind not any one Negro
woman, but rather a colorful pageant of individuals, each differently
endowed. Like the red and yellow of the tiger-lily, the skin of one is
brilliant against the star-lit darkness of a racial sister. From grace
to strength, they vary in infinite degree, with traces of the race’s
history left in physical and mental outline on each. With a discerning
mind, one catches the multiform charm, beauty and character of Negro
women, and grasps the fact that their problems cannot be thought of in
mass.</p>
<p>Because only a few have caught this vision, even in New York, the
general attitude of mind causes the Negro woman serious difficulty. She
is conscious that what is left of chivalry is not directed toward her.
She realizes that the ideals of <span
class="pagenum">[370]</span>beauty, built up in the fine arts, have
excluded her almost entirely. Instead, the grotesque Aunt Jemimas of the
streetcar advertisements, proclaim only an ability to serve, without
grace of loveliness. Nor does the drama catch her finest spirit. She is
most often used to provoke the mirthless laugh of ridicule; or to
portray feminine viciousness or vulgarity not peculiar to Negroes. This
is the shadow over her. To a race naturally sunny comes the twilight of
self-doubt and a sense of personal inferiority. It cannot be denied that
these are potent and detrimental influences, though not generally
recognized because they are in the realm of the mental and spiritual.
More apparent are the economic handicaps which follow her recent
entrance into industry. It is conceded that she has special difficulties
because of the poor working conditions and low wages of her men. It is
not surprising that only the most determined women forge ahead to
results other than mere survival. To the gifted, the zest of meeting a
challenge is a compensating factor which often brings success. The few
who do prove their mettle, stimulate one to a closer study of how this
achievement is won under contemporary conditions.</p>
<p>Better to visualize the Negro woman at her job, our vision of a host
of individuals must once more resolve itself into groups on the basis of
activity. First, comes a very small leisure group—the wives and
daughters of men who are in business, in the professions and a few
well-paid personal service occupations. Second, a most active and
progressive group, the women in business and the professions. Third, the
many women in the trades and industry. Fourth, a group weighty in
numbers struggling on in domestic service, with an even less fortunate
fringe of casual workers, fluctuating with the economic temper of the
times.</p>
<p>The first is a pleasing group to see. It is picked for outward beauty
by Negro men with much the same feeling as other Americans of the same
economic class. Keeping their women free to preside over the family,
these women are affected by the problems of every wife and mother, but
touched only faintly by their race’s hardships. They do share acutely in
the prevailing difficulty of finding competent household help. <span
class="pagenum">[371]</span>Negro wives find Negro maids unwilling
generally to work in their own neighborhoods, for various reasons. They
do not wish to work where there is a possibility of acquaintances coming
into contact with them while they serve and they still harbor the
misconception that Negroes of any station are unable to pay as much as
persons of the other race. It is in these homes of comparative ease that
we find the polite activities of social exclusiveness. The luxuries of
well-appointed homes, modest motors, tennis, golf and country clubs,
trips to Europe and California, make for social standing. The problem
confronting the refined Negro family is to know others of the same
achievement. The search for kindred spirits gradually grows less
difficult; in the past it led to the custom of visiting all the large
cities in order to know similar groups of cultured Negro people. In
recent years, the more serious minded Negro woman’s visit to Europe has
been extended from months to years for the purpose of study and travel.
The European success which meets this type of ambition is instanced in
the conferring of the doctorate in philosophy upon a Negro woman,
Dr. Anna J. Cooper, at the last commencement of the Sorbonne, Paris.
Similarly, a score of Negro women are sojourning abroad in various
countries for the spiritual relief and cultural stimulation afforded
there.</p>
<p>A spirit of stress and struggles characterizes the second two groups.
These women of business, profession and trade are the hub of the wheel
of progress. Their burden is twofold. Many are wives and mothers whose
husbands are insufficiently paid, or who have succumbed to social
maladjustment and have abandoned their families. An appalling number are
widows. They face the great problem of leaving home each day and at the
same time trying to rear children in their spare time—this, too, in
neighborhoods where rents are large, standards of dress and recreation
high and costly, and social danger on the increase. One cannot resist
the temptation to pause for a moment and pay tribute to these Negro
mothers. And to call attention to the service she is rendering to the
nation, in her struggle against great odds to educate and care for one
group of the country’s children. If the mothers of the race should <span
class="pagenum">[372]</span>ever be honored by state or federal
legislation, the artist’s imagination will find a more inspiring subject
in the modern Negro mother—self-directed but as loyal and tender as the
much extolled, yet pitiable black mammy of slavery days.</p>
<p>The great commercial life of New York City is only slightly touched
by the Negro woman, of our second group. Negro business men offer her
most of their work, but their number is limited. Outside of this field
in Negro offices, custom is once more against her, and competition is
keen for all. However, Negro girls are training and some are holding
exceptional jobs. One of the professors in a New York college has had a
young colored woman as secretary for the past three or four years.
Another holds the head clerical position in an organization where
reliable handling of detail and a sense of business ethics are
essential. Quietly these women prove their worth, so that when a vacancy
exists and there is a call, it is difficult to find even one competent
colored secretary who is not employed. As a result of the opportunity in
clerical work in the educational system of New York City, a number have
qualified for such positions, one having been recently appointed to the
office of a high school. In other departments, the civil service in New
York City is no longer free from discrimination. The casual personal
interview, that tenacious and retrogressive practice introduced into the
federal administration during the World War, has spread and often
nullifies the Negro woman’s success in written tests. The successful
young woman cited above was three times “turned down” as undesirable on
the basis of the personal interview. In the great mercantile houses, the
many young Negro girls who might be well suited to sales positions are
barred from all but menial positions. Even so, one Negro woman,
beginning as a uniformed maid in the shoe department of one of the
largest stores, has pulled herself up to the position of “head of
stock.” One of the most prosperous monthly magazines of national
circulation has for the head of its news service a Negro woman who rose
from the position of stenographer. Her duties involve attendance upon
staff conferences, executive supervision of her staff of white office
workers, broadcasting and journalism of the highest order.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[373]</span>Yet in spite of the claims of
justice and proved efficiency, telephone and insurance companies and
other corporations which receive considerable patronage from Negroes
deny them proportionate employment. Fortunately this is an era of
changing customs. There is hope that a less selfish racial attitude will
prevail. It is a heartening fact that there is an increasing number of
Americans who will lend a hand in the game fight of the worthy.</p>
<p>Throughout the South, where businesses for Negro patronage are under
the control of Negroes to a large extent, there are already many
opportunities for Negro women. But, because of the nerve strain and
spiritual drain of hostile social conditions in that section, Negro
women are turning away from opportunities there to find a freer and
fuller life in the North.</p>
<p>In the less crowded professional vocations, the outlook is more
cheerful. In these fields, the Negro woman is dependent largely upon
herself and her own race for work. In the legal, dental and medical
professions, successful women practitioners have usually worked their
way through college and are “managing” on the small fees that can be
received from an underpaid public.</p>
<p>Social conditions in America are hardest upon the Negro because he is
lowest in the economic scale. The tendency to force the Negro downward,
gives rise to serious social problems and to a consequent demand for
trained college women in the profession of social work. The need has
been met with a response from young college women, anxious to devote
their education and lives toward helping the submerged classes. Much of
the social work has been pioneer in nature; the pay has been small, with
little possibility of advancement. For, even in work among Negroes, the
better paying positions are reserved for whites. The Negro college woman
is doing her bit at a sacrifice, along such lines as these: as probation
officers, investigators and police women in the correctional departments
of the city; as Big Sisters attached to the Children’s Court; as field
workers and visitors for relief organizations, missions and churches; as
secretaries for traveller’s aid societies; in the many organizations
devoted to preventative and educational <span
class="pagenum">[374]</span>medicine; in clinics and hospitals and as
boys’ and girls’ welfare workers in recreation and industry.</p>
<p>In the profession of nursing, there are over three hundred in New
York City. In the dark blue linen uniform of Henry Street Visiting Nurse
Service, the Negro woman can be seen hurrying earnestly from house to
house on her round of free relief to the needy. Again, she is in many
other branches of public health nursing, in the public schools, milk
stations and diet kitchens. The Negro woman is in the wards of two of
the large city hospitals and clinics. After a score of years of service
in one such institution, a Negro woman became superintendent of nurses
in the war emergency. Deposed after the armistice, though eminently
satisfactory, she retained connection with the training school as
lecturer, for the inspiration she could be to “her girls.” The growing
need for the executive nurse is being successfully met as instanced by
the supervisors in day nurseries and private sanitariums, financed and
operated in Harlem entirely by Negroes. Throughout the South there is a
clear and anxious call to nurses to carry the gospel of hygiene to the
rural sections and to minister to the suffering not reached by
organizations already in the communities. One social worker, in New York
City, though a teacher by profession, is head of an organization whose
program is to raise money for the payment of nurses to do the work
described above. In other centers, West and South, the professional
Negro nurse is supplanting the untrained woman attendant of former
years.</p>
<p>In New York City, nearly three hundred women share in the good
conditions obtaining there in the teaching profession. They measure up
to the high pedagogical requirements of the city and state law, and are
increasingly leaders in the community. In a city where the schools are
not segregated, she is meeting with success among white as well as
colored children in positions ranging from clerk in the elementary
school on up through the graded ranks of teachers in the lower grades,
of special subjects in the higher grades, in the junior high schools and
in the senior high schools. One Negro woman is assistant principal in an
elementary school where the other assistant and <span
class="pagenum">[375]</span>the principal are white men and the majority
of the teachers white. Another Negro woman serves in the capacity of
visiting teacher to several schools, calling upon both white and colored
families and experiencing no difficulty in making social adjustments.
Still another Negro woman is a vocational counsellor under the Board of
Education, in a junior high school. She is advising children of both
races as to future courses of study to pursue and as to the vocations in
which tests prove them to be apt. This position, the result of pioneer
work by another Negro woman, is unique in the school system of New
York.</p>
<p>In the teaching profession, too, the Negro woman finds evidence of
the white worker’s fear of competition. The need for teachers is still
so great that little friction exists. When it does seem imminent, it is
smoothed away, as it recently was at a meeting of school principals.
From the floor a discussion began with: “What are we going to do about
this problem of the increasing number of Negro teachers coming into our
schools?” It ended promptly through the suggestion of another principal:
“Send all you get and don’t want over to my school. I have two now and
I’ll match their work with any two of the best you name.” Outside of New
York City, the Negro woman teacher faces problems almost as difficult as
those besetting the pioneers in the field. Night riders are terrorizing
the leading educators of the South, with the same tactics used years ago
in the burning of buildings and in the threatening of personal injury.
Negro teachers in some sections show heroism matching that of such women
as Maria Becroft, Mary Wormely, Margaret Thompson, Fannie Hampton,
Myrtilla Miner and others who in the early ’8o’s faced riot and violence
which closed colored schools and made educational work a hazardous
vocation. Throughout the North and South, urban and rural teachers form
an earnest and forward-looking group of women. They are endeavoring to
hold for the future the progress that has been made in the past. The
Negro woman teacher finds that, figuratively speaking, she must stand on
her tip toes to do it, for educational standards are no longer what they
were. Surrounded by forces <span class="pagenum">[376]</span>which
persistently work to establish the myth of his inferiority, the Negro
youth must be encouraged to think vigorously and to maintain a critical
attitude toward what he is taught. The Negro teacher is bending herself
to the task of imparting this power to hold the spiritual and mental
balance under hostile conditions. Though her salary in most places lags
behind the service she is rendering (exceptions being noted where the
Jeannes-Slater and Rosenwald Funds bring relief), her inspiration is the
belief that the hope of the race is in the New Negro student. Of more
vital import than what he is compelled to be to-day, is what he is
determined to make of himself tomorrow. And, the Negro woman teacher,
bringing to the class room sympathy and judgment, is a mighty force in
this battle.</p>
<p>Comparatively new are opportunities in the field of trained library
work for the Negro woman. In New York City, the Public Library system
has opened its service to the employment of colored women of college
grade. The vision of those in charge of their training is illuminated by
fires that have somewhat of a missionary glow. There is an ever-present
hope that, once trained, the Negro woman librarian will scatter such
opportunities across the country, establishing branches wherever none
exist. Into such an emergency, the successful Negro woman head of the
library of the Veterans’ Hospital at Tuskegee, stepped from the New York
Library on One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Street. Recently at this same
Harlem Branch Library a Negro woman has been placed in charge of the
large, permanent collection of books by or about Negroes and examples of
Negro art. Another is acting head of the children’s department, and
several others have been assigned to branches throughout the city where
there is little or no Negro patronage. They are thus rendering
exceptional service, and additionally creating an impetus for the
enlargement of this field for Negro women.</p>
<p>One might go on to such interesting and more unusual professions as
bacteriology, chemistry and pharmacy, etc., and find that though the
number in any one may be small, the Negro woman is creditably
represented in practically every one, and <span
class="pagenum">[377]</span>according to ability, she is meeting with
success. In the fields of literature and art, the Negro woman’s culture
has once more begun to flower. After the long quiescent period,
following the harvest from the pen of Phyllis Wheatley, Negro women
dramatists, poets and novelists are enjoying a vogue in print. There is
every prospect that the Negro woman will enrich American literature and
art with stylistic portrayal of her experience and her problems.</p>
<p>Closing the door on the home anxieties, the women engaged in trades
and in industry faces serious difficulty in competition in the open
working field. Custom is against the Negro woman in all but a few trade
and industrial occupations. She has, however, been established long in
the dressmaking trade as helpers and finishers, and more recently as
drapers and fitters in some of the best establishments. Several Negro
women are themselves proprietors of shops in the country’s great fashion
district. In millinery, power-sewing machine operating on cloth, straw
and leather, there are few Negro women. The laissez- faire attitude of
practically all trade unions has, in the past, made of the Negro woman
an unwilling menace to the cause of labor. When one reviews the demands
now being made by white women workers, for labor colleges, for political
recognition, and for representation at world conferences, one cannot
help but feel how far back on the road of labor progress is the
struggling group of Negro workers. Yet, they are gradually becoming more
alive to the issues involved. One Negro woman has held office and been
most active in the flower and feather workers’ union. Another has been a
paid organizer in the garment industry for several years. Still another
has co-operated as an unpaid worker, in endeavoring to prevent Negro
women from breaking union strikes. Pacing with pickets, or explaining at
meetings the wisdom underlying union principles, she became convinced
that the problem lay as much in the short-sighted,
“wait-until-a-strike-comes” policy of the labor unions themselves, as in
the alienated or unintelligent attitude of the Negro worker. More
sincerity and understanding was greatly needed. Within the past year,
she has worked with two Negro men, a white woman and two white men, all
<span class="pagenum">[378]</span>union members, and with this committee
of six has brought about a conference of accredited delegates from
thirty-three unions in New York City. This is the first all-union
conference held on adjusting the Negro workers’ problem. As a result, a
permanent organization has been formed called the Trade Union Committee
for Organizing Negro Workers. Headquarters have been established and a
program is well under way which includes:—organizing special industries,
manned largely by Negro men and women; working to bring about changes in
the constitutions of trade unions which make it impossible or difficult
for Negroes to join; educating both black and white workers in union
principles through conferences and speeches; making necessary
adjustments among union members of the two races and taking part in
righting any grievances of Negro union members.</p>
<p>In trade cookery, the Negro woman’s talent and past experience is
recognized. Her problem here is to find employers who will let her work
her way to managerial positions, in tearooms, candy shops and
institutions. One such employer became convinced that the managing cook,
a young colored graduate of Pratt Institute, could build up a business
that had been failing. He offered her a partnership. As in the cases of
a number of such women, her barrier was lack of capital. No matter how
highly trained, nor how much speed and business acumen has been
acquired, the Negro’s credit is held in doubt. An exception in this
matter of capital will serve to prove the rule. Thirty years ago, a
young Negro girl began learning all branches of the fur trade. She is
now in business for herself, employing three women of her race and one
Jewish man. She has made fur experts of still another half-dozen colored
girls. Such instances as these justify the prediction that the foothold
which is being gained in the trade world will, year by year, become more
secure.</p>
<p>Because of the limited fields for this group, many of the
unsuccessful drift into the fourth social grade—the domestic and casual
workers. These drifters increase the difficulties of the Negro women
suited to housework. New standards of household management are forming
and the problem of the <span class="pagenum">[379]</span>Negro woman is
to meet these new businesslike ideals. The constant influx of workers
unfamiliar with household conditions in New York keeps the situation one
of turmoil. The Negro woman, moreover, is revolting against residential
domestic service. It is a last stand in her fight to maintain a
semblance of family life. For this reason, principally, the number of
day or casual workers is on the increase. Happiness is almost impossible
under the strain of these conditions. Health and morale suffer, but how
else can her children, loose all afternoon, be gathered together at
nightfall? Through it all she manages to give satisfactory service and
the Negro woman is sought after for this unpopular work, largely because
her honesty, loyalty and cleanliness have stood the test of time.
Through her drudgery, the women of other groups find leisure time for
progress. This is one of her contributions to America.</p>
<p>It is apparent from what has been said that even in New York City,
Negro women are of a race which is free neither economically, socially
nor spiritually. Like women in general, but more particularly like those
of other oppressed minorities, the Negro woman has been forced to submit
to overpowering conditions. Pressure has been exerted upon her, both
from without and within her group. Her emotional and sex life is a
reflex of her economic station. The women of the working class will
react, emotionally and sexually, similarly to the working-class woman of
other races. The Negro woman does not maintain any moral standard which
may be assigned chiefly to qualities of race, any more than a white
woman does. Yet she has been singled out and advertised as having lower
sex standards. Superficial critics who have had contact only with the
lower grades of Negro women, claim that they are more immoral than other
groups of women. This I deny. This is the sort of criticism which
predicates of one race, to its detriment, that which is common to all
races. Sex irregularities are not a matter of race, but of
socio-economic conditions. Research shows that most of the African
tribes from which the Negro sprang have strict codes for sex relations.
There is no proof of inherent weakness in the ethnic group.</p>
<p>Gradually overcoming the habitual limits imposed upon her <span
class="pagenum">[380]</span>by slave masters, she increasingly seeks
legal sanction for the consummation and dissolution of sex contracts.
Contrary to popular belief, illegitimacy among Negroes is cause for
shame and grief. When economic, social and biological forces combined
bring about unwed motherhood, the reaction is much the same as in
families in other racial groups. Secrecy is maintained if possible.
Generally the married aunt or even the girl’s mother claims the
illegitimate child as her own. The foundling asylum is seldom sought.
Schooled in this kind of suffering in the days of slavery, the Negro
woman often tempers scorn with sympathy for weakness. Stigma does fall
upon the unmarried mother, but perhaps in this matter the Negro’s
attitude is nearer the modern enlightened ideal for the social treatment
of the unfortunate. May not this, too, be considered another
contribution to America?</p>
<p>With all these forces at work, true sex equality has not been
approximated. The ratio of opportunity in the sex, social, economic and
political spheres is about that which exists between white men and
women. In the large, I would say that the Negro woman is the cultural
equal of her man because she is generally kept in school longer. Negro
boys, like white boys, are usually put to work to subsidize the family
income. The growing economic independence of Negro working women is
causing her to rebel against the domineering family attitude of the
cruder working-class husband. The masses of Negro men are engaged in
menial occupations throughout the working day. Their baffled and
suppressed desires to determine their economic life are manifested in
overbearing domination at home. Working mothers are unable to instill
different ideals in the sons. Conditions change slowly. Nevertheless,
education and opportunity are modifying the spirit of the younger Negro
men. Trained in modern schools of thought, they begin to show a
wholesome attitude of fellowship and freedom for their women. The
challenge to young Negro womanhood is to see clearly this trend and
grasp the proffered comradeship with sincerity. In this matter of sex
equality, Negro women have contributed few outstanding militants, a
notable instance being the historic Sojourner Truth. On the whole the
Negro <span class="pagenum">[381]</span>woman’s feminist efforts are
directed chiefly toward the realization of the equality of the races,
the sex struggle assuming the subordinate place.</p>
<p>Obsessed with difficulties which might well compel individualism, the
Negro woman has engaged in a considerable amount of organized action to
meet group needs. She has evolved a federation of her clubs, embracing
between eight and ten thousand women in New York state alone. The state
federation is a part of the National Association of Colored Women,
which, calling together the women from all parts of the country, engages
itself in enterprises of general race interest. The national
organization of colored women is now firmly established, and under the
presidency of Mrs. Bethune is about to strive for conspicuous goals.</p>
<p>In New York City, many associations exist for social betterment,
financed and operated by Negro women. One makes child welfare its name
and special concern. Others, like the Utility Club, Utopia Neighborhood,
Debutantes’ League, Sempre Fidelius, etc., raise funds for old folks’
homes, a shelter for delinquent girls and fresh-air camps for children.
The Colored Women’s Branch of the Y. W. C. A. and the women’s
organizations in the many churches as well as the beneficial lodges and
associations, care for the needs of their members.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the educational welfare of the coming generation
has become the chief concern of the national sororities of Negro college
women. The first to be organized in the country, the <em>Alpha Kappa
Alpha</em> has a systematized, a continuous program of educational and
vocational guidance for students of the high schools and colleges. The
work of Lambda Chapter, which covers New York City and its suburbs, has
been most effective in carrying out the national program. Each year, it
gathers together between one and two hundred such students and gives the
girls a chance to hear the life stories of Negro women, successful in
various fields of endeavor. Recently a trained nurse told how, starting
in the same schools as they, she had risen to the executive position in
the Harlem Health Information Bureau. A commercial artist showed how
real talent had overcome the color line. The graduate physician <span
class="pagenum">[382]</span>was a living example of the modern
opportunities in the newer fields of medicine open to women. The
vocations, as outlets for the creative instinct, became attractive under
the persuasion of the musician, the dressmaker and the decorator. A
recent graduate outlined her plans for meeting the many difficulties
encountered in establishing a dental office and in building up a
practice. A journalist spun the fascinating tale of her years of
experience. The <em>Delta Sigma Theta</em> Sorority (national in scope)
works along similar lines. Alpha Beta Chapter of New York City, during
the current year, presented a young art student with a scholarship of
$1,000 for study abroad. In such ways as these are the progressive and
privileged groups of Negro women expressing their community and race
consciousness.</p>
<p>We find the Negro woman, figuratively struck in the face daily by
contempt from the world about her. Within her soul, she knows little of
peace and happiness. But through it all, she is courageously standing
erect, developing within herself the moral strength to rise above and
conquer false attitudes. She is maintaining her natural beauty and charm
and improving her mind and opportunity. She is measuring up to the needs
of her family, community and race, and radiating a hope throughout the
land.</p>
<p>The wind of the race’s destiny stirs more briskly because of her
striving.</p>
