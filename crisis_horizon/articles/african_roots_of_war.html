</h2>
<p>‘Semper novi quid ex Africa,’ cried the Roman proconsul; and he
voiced the verdict of forty centuries. Yet there are those who would
write world-history and leave out this most marvelous of continents.
Particularly to-day most men assume that Africa lies far afield from the
centres of our burning social problems, and especially from our present
problem of World War.</p>
<p>Yet in a very real sense Africa is a prime cause of this terrible
overturning of civilization which we have lived to see; and these words
seek to show how in the Dark Continent are hidden the roots, not simply
of war to-day but of the menace of wars to-morrow.</p>
<p>Always Africa is giving us something new or some metempsychosis of a
world-old thing. On its black bosom arose one of the earliest, if not
the earliest, of self-protecting civilizations, and grew so mightily
that it still furnishes superlatives to thinking and speaking men. Out
of its darker and more remote forest fastnesses, came, if we may credit
many recent scientists, the first welding of iron, and we know that
agriculture and trade flourished there when Europe was a wilderness.</p>
<p>Nearly every human empire that has arisen in the world, material and
spiritual, has found some of its greatest crises on this continent of
Africa, from Greece to Great Britain. As Mommsen says, “It was through
Africa that Christianity became the religion of the world.” In Africa
the last flood of Germanic invasions spent itself within hearing of the
last gasp of Byzantium, and it was again through Africa that Islam came
to play its great rôle of conqueror and civilizer.</p>
<p>With the Renaissance and the widened world of modern thought, Africa
came no less suddenly with her new old gift. Shakespeare’s Ancient
Pistol cries,—</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="verse">
A foutre for the world, and worldlings base!
<p class="verse">
I speak of Africa, and golden joys.<br />

</div>
<p>He echoes a legend of gold from the days of Punt and Ophir to those
of Ghana, the Gold Coast, and the Rand. This thought had sent the
world’s greed scurrying down the hot, mysterious coasts of Africa to the
Good Hope of gain, until for the first time a real world-commerce was
born, albeit it started as a commerce mainly in the bodies and souls of
men.</p>
<p>So much for the past; and now, to-day: the Berlin Conference to
apportion the rising riches of Africa among the white peoples met on the
fifteenth day of November, 1884. Eleven days earlier, three Germans left
Zanzibar (whither they had gone secretly disguised as mechanics), and
before the Berlin Conference had finished its deliberations they had
annexed to Germany as an area over half as large again as the whole
German Empire in Europe. Only in its dramatic suddenness was this
undisguised robbery of the land of seven million natives different from
the methods by which Great Britain and France got four million square
miles each, Portugal three quarters of a million, and Italy and Spain
smaller but substantial areas.</p>
<p>The methods by which this continent has been stolen have been
contemptible and dishonest beyond expression. Lying treaties, rivers of
rum, murder, assassination, mutilation, rape, and torture have marked
the progress of Englishman, German, Frenchman, and Belgian on the dark
continent. The only way in which the world has been able to endure the
horrible tale is by deliberately stopping its ears and changing the
subject of conversation while the deviltry went on.</p>
<p>It all began, singularly enough, like the present war, with Belgium.
Many of us remember Stanley’s great solution of the puzzle of Central
Africa when he traced the mighty Congo sixteen hundred miles from
Nyangwe to the sea. Suddenly the world knew that here lay the key to the
riches of Central Africa. It stirred uneasily, but Leopold of Belgium
was first on his feet, and the result was the Congo Free State—God save
the mark! But the Congo Free State, with all its magniloquent heralding
of Peace, Christianity, and Commerce, degenerating into murder,
mutilation and downright robbery, differed only in degree and
concentration from the tale of all Africa in this rape of a continent
already furiously mangled by the slave trade. That sinister traffic, on
which the British Empire and the American Republic were largely built,
cost black Africa no less than 100,000,000 souls, the wreckage of its
political and social life, and left the continent in precisely that
state of continent in precisely that state of helplessness which invites
aggression and exploitation. ‘Color’ became in the world’s thought
synonymous with inferiority, ‘Negro’ lost its capitalization, and Africa
was another name for bestiality and barbarism.</p>
<p>Thus the world began to invest in color prejudice. The ‘Color Line’
began to pay dividends. For indeed, while the exploration of the valley
of the Congo was the occasion of the scramble for Africa, the cause lay
deeper. The Franco-Prussian War turned the eyes of those who sought
power and dominion away from Europe. Already England was in Africa,
cleaning away the debris of the slave trade and half consciously groping
toward the new Imperialism. France, humiliated and impoverished, looked
toward a new northern African empire sweeping from the Atlantic to the
Red Sea. More slowly Germany began to see the dawning of a new day, and,
shut out from America by the Monroe Doctrine, looked to Asia and Africa
for colonies. Portugal sought anew to make good her claim to her ancient
African realm; and thus a continent where Europe claimed but a tenth of
the land in 1875, was in twenty-five more years practically
absorbed.</p>
<h2 class="center">
II
</h2>
<p>Why was this? What was the new call for dominion? It must have been
strong, for consider a moment the desperate flames of war that have shot
up in Africa in the last quarter of a century: France and England at
Fashoda, Italy at Adua, Italy and Turkey in Tripoli, England and
Portugal at Delagoa Bay, England, Germany, and the Dutch in South
Africa, France and Spain in Morocco, Germany and France in Agadir, and
the world at Algeciras.</p>
<p>The answer to this riddle we shall find in the economic changes in
Europe. Remember what the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have meant
to organized industry in European civilization. Slowly the divine right
of the few to determine economic income and distribute the goods and
services of the world has been questioned and curtailed. We called the
process Revolution in the eighteenth century, advancing Democracy in the
nineteenth, and Socialization of Wealth in the twentieth. But whatever
we call it, the movement is the same: the dipping of more and grimier
hands into the wealth-bag of the nation, until to-day only the ultra
stubborn fail to see that democracy in determining income is the next
inevitable step to Democracy in political power.</p>
<p>With the waning of the possibility of the Big Fortune, gathered by
starvation wage and boundless exploitation of one’s weaker and poorer
fellows at home, arose more magnificently the dream of exploitation
abroad. Always, of course, the individual merchant had at his own risk
and in his own way tapped the riches of foreign lands. Later, special
trading monopolies had entered the field and founded empires over-seas.
Soon, however, the mass of merchants at home demanded a share in this
golden stream; and finally, in the twentieth century, the laborer at
home is demanding and beginning to receive a part of his share.</p>
<p>The theory of the new democratic despotism has not been clearly
formulated. Most philosophers see the ship of state launched on the
broad, irresistible tide of democracy, with only delaying eddies here
and there; others, looking closer, are more disturbed. Are we, they ask,
reverting to aristocracy and despotism—the rule of might? They cry out
and then rub their eyes, for surely they cannot fail to see
strengthening democracy all about them?</p>
<p>It is this paradox which has confounded philanthropists, curiously
betrayed the Socialists, and reconciled the Imperialists and captains of
industry to any amount of ‘Democracy.’ It is this paradox which allows
in America the most rapid advance of democracy to go hand in hand in its
very centres with increased aristocracy and hatred toward darker races,
and which excuses and defends an inhumanity that does not shrink from
the public burning of human beings.</p>
<p>Yet the paradox is easily explained: the white workingman has been
asked to share the spoil of exploiting ‘chinks and niggers.’ It is no
longer simply the merchant prince, or the aristocratic monopoly, or even
the employing class, that is exploiting the world: it is the nation; a
new democratic nation composed of united capital and labor. The laborers
are not yet getting, to be sure, as large a share as they want or will
get, and there are still at the bottom large and restless excluded
classes. But the laborer’s equity is recognized, and his just share is a
matter of time, intelligence, and skillful negotiation.</p>
<p>Such nations it is that rule the modern world. Their national bond is
no mere sentimental patriotism, loyalty, or ancestor-worship. It is
increased wealth, power, and luxury for all classes on a scale the world
never saw before. Never before was the average citizen of England,
France, and Germany so rich, with such splendid prospects of greater
riches.</p>
<p>Whence comes this new wealth on what does its accumulation depend? It
comes primarily from the darker nations of the world—Asia and Africa,
South and Central America, the West Indies and the islands of the South
Seas. There are still, we may well believe, many parts of white
countries like Russia and North Ameirca, not to mention Europe itself,
where the older exploitation still holds. But the knell has sounded
faint and far, even there. In the lands of darker folk, however, no
knell has sounded. Chinese, East Indians, Negroes, and South American
Indians are by common consent for governance by white folk and economic
subjection to them. To the furtherance of this highly profitable
economic dictum has been brought every available resource of science and
religion. Thus arises the astonishing doctrine of the natural
inferiority of most men to the few, and the interpretation ‘Christian
brotherhood’ as meaning anything that one of the ‘brothers’ may at any
time want it to mean.</p>
<p>Like all world-schemes, however, this one is not quite complete.
First of all, yellow Japan has apparently escaped the cordon of this
color bar. This is disconcerting and dangerous to white hegemony. If, of
course, Japan would join heart and soul with the whites against the rest
of the yellows, browns, and blacks, well and good. There are even
good-natured attempts to prove the Japanese ‘Aryan,’ provided they act
‘white.’ But blood is thick, and there are signs that japan does not
dream of a world governed mainly by white men. This is the ‘Yellow
Peril,’ and it may be necessary, as the German Emperor and many white
Americans think, to start a world-crusade against this presumptuous
nation which demands ‘white’ treatment.</p>
<p>Then, too, the Chinese have recently shown unexpected signs of
independence and autonomy, which may possibly make it necessary to take
them into account a few decades hence. As a result, the problem in Asia
has resolved itself into a race for ‘spheres’ of economic ‘influence,’
each provided with a more or less ‘open door’ for business opportunity.
This reduces the danger of open class between European nations, and
gives the yellow folk such chance for desperate unarmed resistance as
was shown by China’s repulse of the Six Nations of Bankers. There is
still hope among some whites that conservative North China and the
radical South may in time come to blows and allow actual white
dominion.</p>
<p>One thing, however, is certain: Africa is prostrate. There at least
are few signs of self-consciousness that need at present be heeded. To
be sure, Abyssinia must be wheedled, and in America and the West Indies
Negroes have attempted futile steps toward freedom; but such steps have
been pretty effectually stopped (save through the breech of
‘miscegenation’), although the ten million Negroes in the United States
need, to many men’s minds, careful watching and ruthless repression.</p>
<h2 class="center">
III
</h2>
<p>Thus the white European mind has worked, and worked the more
feverishly because Africa is the Land of the Twentieth Century. The
world knows something of the gold and diamonds of South Africa, the
cocoa of Angola, and Nigeria, the rubber and ivory of the Congo, and the
palm oil of the West Coast. But does the ordinary citizen realize the
extraordinary economic advances of Africa and, too, of black Africa, in
recent years? E. T. Morel, who knows his Africa better than most white
men, has shown us how the export of palm oil from West Africa has grown
from 283 tons in 1800, to 80,000 tons in 1913, which together with
by-products is worth to-day $60,000,000 annually. He shows how native
Gold Coat labor, unsupervised, has come to head the cocoa-producing
countries of the world with an export of 89,000,000 pounds (weight not
money) annually. He shows how the cotton crop of Uganda has risen from
3000 bales in 1909 to 50,000 bales in 1914; and he says that France and
Belgium are no more remarkable in the cultivation of their land than the
Negro province of Kano. The trade of Abyssinia amounts to only
$10,000,000 a year, but it is its infinite possibility of growth that is
making the nations crowd to Adis Abeda. All these things are but
beginnings; ‘but tropical Africa and its peoples are being brought more
irrevocably each year into the vortex of the economic influences that
sway the western world.’ There can be no doubt of the economic
possibilities of Africa in the near future. There are not only the
well-known and traditional products, but boundless chances in a hundred
different directions, and above all, there is a throng of human beings
who, could they once be reduced to the docility and steadiness of
Chinese coolie or of seventeenth and eighteenth century European
laborers, would furnish to their masters a spoil exceeding the
gold-haunted dreams of the most modern of Imperialists.</p>
<p>This, then, is the real secret of that desperate struggle for Africa
which began in 1877 and is now culminating. Economic dominion outside
Africa has, of course, played its part, and we were on the verge of the
partition of Asia when Asiatic shrewdness warded it off. America was
saved from direct political dominion by the Monroe Doctrine. Thus, more
and more, the Imperialists have concentrated on Africa.</p>
<p>The greater the concentration the more deadly the rivalry. From
Fasoda to Agadir, repeatedly the spark has been applied to the European
magazine and a general conflagration narrowly averted. We speak of the
Balkans as the storm-centre of Europe and the cause of war, but this is
mere habit. The Balkans are convenient for occasions, but the ownership
of materials and men in the darker world is the real prize that is
setting the nations of Europe at each other’s throats to-day.</p>
<p>The present world war is, then, the result of jealousies engendered
by the recent rise of armed national associations of labor and capital
whose aim is the exploitation of the wealth of the world mainly outside
the European circle of nations. These associations, grown jealous and
suspicious at the division of the spoils of trade-empire, are fighting
to enlarge their respective shares; they look for expansion, not in
Europe but in Asia, and particularly in Africa. ‘We want no inch of
French territory,’ said Germany to England, but Germany was ‘unable to
give’ similar assurances as to France in Africa.</p>
<p>The difficulties of this imperial movement are internal as well as
external. Successful aggression in economic expansion calls for a close
union between capital and labor at home. Now the rising demands of the
white laborer, not simply for wages but for conditions of work and a
voice in the conduct of industry, make industrial peace difficult. The
workingmen have been appeased by all sorts of essays in state socialism,
on the one hand, and on the other hand by public threats of competition
by colored labor. By threatening to send English capital to China and
Mexico, by threatening to hire Negro laborers in America, as well as by
old-age pensions and accident insurance, we gain industrial peace at
home at the mightier cost of war abroad.</p>
<p>In addition to all these national war-engendering jealousies there is
a more subtle movement arising from the attempt to unite labor and
capital in world-wide freebooting. Democracy in economic organization,
while an acknowledged ideal, is to-day working itself out by admitting
to a share in the spoils of capital only the aristocracy of labor—the
more intelligent and shrewder and cannier workingmen. The ignorant,
unskilled, and restless still form a large, threatening, and, to a
growing extent, revolutionary group in advanced countries.</p>
<p>The resultant jealousies and bitter hatreds tend continually to
fester along the color line. We must fight the Chinese, the laborer
argues, or the Chinese will take our bread and butter. We must keep
Negroes in their places, or Negroes will take our jobs. All over the
world there leaps to articulate speech and ready action that singular
assumption that if white men do not throttle colored men, then China,
India, and Africa will do to Europe what Europe has done and seeks to do
to them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the minds of yellow, brown, and black men the
brutal truth is clearing: a white man is privileged to go to any land
where advantage beckons and behave as he pleases; the black or colored
man is being more and more confined to those parts of the world where
life for climatic, historical, economic, and political reasons is most
difficult to live and most easily dominated by Europe for Europe’s
gain.</p>
<h2 class="center">
IV
</h2>
<p>What, then, are we to do, who desire peace and the civilization of
all men? Hitherto the peace movement has confined itself chiefly to
figures about the cost of war and platitudes on humanity. What do
nations care about the cost of war, if by spending a few hundred
millions in steel and gunpowder they can gain a thousand millions in
diamonds and cocoa? How can love of humanity appeal as a motive to
nations whose love of luxury is built on the inhuman exploitation of
human beings, and who, especially in recent years, have been taught to
regard these human beings as inhuman? I appealed to the last meeting of
peace societies in St. Louis, saying, ‘Should you not discuss racial
prejudice as a prime cause of war?’ The secretary was sorry but was
unwilling to introduce controversial matters!</p>
<p>We, then, who want peace, must remove the real causes of war. We have
extended gradually our conception of democracy beyond our social class
to all social classes in our nation; we have gone further and extended
our democratic ideals not simply to all classes of our nation, but to
those of other nations of our blood and lineage—to what we call
‘European’ civilization. If we want real peace and lasting culture,
however, we must go further. We must extend the democratic ideal to the
yellow, brown, and black peoples.</p>
<p>To say this, is to evoke on the faces of modern men a look of blank
hopelessness. Impossible! we are told, and for so many
reasons,—scientific, social, and what not,—that argument is useless. But
let us not conclude too quickly. Suppose we have to choose between this
unspeakably inhuman outrage on decency and intelligence and religion
which we call the World War and the attempt to treat black men as human,
sentient, responsible beings? We have sold them as cattle. We are
working them as beasts of burden. We shall not drive war from this world
until we treat them as free and equal citizens in a world-democracy of
all races and nations. Impossible? Democracy is a method of doing the
impossible. It is the only method yet discovered of making the education
and development of all men a matter of all men’s desperate desire. It is
putting firearms in the hands of a child with the object of compelling
the child’s neighbors to teach him, not only the real and legitimate
uses of a dangerous tool but the uses of himself in all things. Are
there other and less costly ways of accomplishing this? There may be in
some better world. But for a world just emerging from the rough chains
of an almost universal poverty, and faced by the temptation of luxury
and indulgence through the enslaving of defenseless men, there is but
one adequate method of salvation—the giving of democratic weapons of
self-defense to the defenseless.</p>
<p>Nor need we quibble over those ideas,—wealth, education, and
political power,—soil which we have so forested with claim and
counter-claim that we see nothing for the woods.</p>
<p>What the primitive peoples of Africa and the world need and must have
if war is to be abolished is perfectly clear:—</p>
<p>First: land. To-day Africa is being enslaved by the theft of her land
and natural resources. A century ago black men owned all but a morsel of
South Africa. The Dutch and English came, and to-day 1,250,000 whites
own 264,000,000 acres, leaving only 21,000,000 acres for 4,500,000
natives. Finally, to make assurance doubly sure, the Union of South
Africa has refused natives even the right to buy land. This is a
deliberate attempt to force the Negroes to work on farms and in mines
and kitchens for low wages. All over Africa has gone this shameless
monopolizing of land and natural resources to force poverty on the
masses and reduce them to the ‘dumb-driven-cattle’ stage of labor
activity.</p>
<p>Secondly: we must train native races in modern civilization. This can
be done. Modern methods of educating children, honestly and effectively
applied, would make modern, civilized nations out of the vast majority
of human beings on earth to-day. This we have seldom tried. For the most
part Europe is straining every nerve to make over yellow, brown, and
black men into docile beasts of burden, and only an irrepressible few
are allowed to escape and seek (usually abroad) the education of modern
men.</p>
<p>Lastly, the principle of home rule must extend to groups, nations,
and races. The ruling of one people for another people’s whim or gain
must stop. This kind of despotism has been in latter days more and more
skillfully disguised. But the brute fact remains: the white man is
ruling black Africa for the white man’s gain, and just as far as
possible he is doing the same to colored races elsewhere. Can such a
situation bring peace? Will any amount of European concord or
disarmament settle this injustice?</p>
<p>Political power to-day is but the weapon to force economic power.
To-morrow, it may give us spiritual vision and artistic sensibility.
To-day, it gives us or tries to give us bread and butter, and those
classes or nations or races who are without it starve, and starvation is
the weapon of the white world to reduce them to slavery.</p>
<p>We are calling for European concord to-day; but at the utmost
European concord will mean satisfaction with, or acquiescence in, a
given division of the spoils of world-dominion. After all, European
disarmament cannot go below the necessity of defending the aggressions
of the whites against the blacks and browns and yellows. From this will
arise three perpetual dangers of war. First, renewed jealousy at any
division of colonies or spheres of influence agreed upon, if at any
future time the present division comes to seem unfair. Who cared for
Africa in the early nineteenth century? The end was war. These scraps
looked too tempting to Germany. Secondly: war will come from the
revolutionary revolt of the lowest workers. The greater the
international jealousies, the greater the corresponding costs of
armament and the more difficult to fulfill the promises of industrial
democracy in advanced countries. Finally, the colored peoples will not
always submit passively to foreign domination. To some this is a lightly
tossed truism. When a people deserve liberty they fight for it and get
it, say such philosophers; thus making war a regular, necessary step to
liberty. Colored people are familiar with this complacent judgment. They
endure the contemptuous treatment meted out by whites to those not
‘strong’ enough to be free. These nations and races, composing as they
do a vast majority of humanity, are going to endure this treatment just
as long as they must and not a moment longer. Then they are going to
fight and the War of the Color Line will outdo in savage inhumanity any
war this world has yet seen. For colored folk have much to remember and
they would not forget.</p>
<p>But is this inevitable? Must we sit helpless before this awful
prospect? While we are planning, as a result of the present holocaust,
the disarmament of Europe and a European international world-police,
must the rest of the world be left naked to the inevitable horror of
war, especially when we know that it is directly in this outer circle of
races, and not in the inner European household, that the real causes of
present European fighting are to be found?</p>
<p>Our duty is clear. Racial slander must go. Racial prejudice will
follow. Steadfast faith in humanity must come. The domination of one
people by another without the others consent, be the subject people
black or white, must stop. The doctrine of forcible economic expansion
over subject people must go. Religious hypocrisy must stop.
‘Blood-thirsty,’ Mwanga of Uganda killed an English bishop because he
feared that his coming meant English domination. It did mean English
domination, and the world and the bishop knew it, and yet the world was
‘horrified’! Such missionary hypocrisy must go. With clean hands and
honest hearts we must front high Heaven and beg peace in our time.</p>
<p>In this great work who can help us? In the Orient, the awakened
Japanese and the awakening leaders of New China; in India and Egypt, the
young men trained in Europe and European ideals, who now form the stuff
that Revolution is born of. But in Africa? Who better than the
twenty-five million grandchildren of the European slave trade, spread
through the Americas and now writhing desperately for freedom and a
place in the world? And of these millions first of all the ten million
black folk of the United States, now a problem, then a
world-salvation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Twenty centuries before the Christ a great cloud swept over sea and
settled on Africa, darkening and well-nigh blotting out the culture of
the land of Egypt. For half a thousand years it rested there until a
black woman, Queen Nefertari, ‘the most venerated figure in Egyptian
history,’ rose to the throne of the Pharaohs and redeemed the world and
her people. Twenty centuries after Christ, black Africa, prostrate,
raped, and shamed, lies at the feet of the conquering Philistines of
Europe. Beyond the awful sea a black woman is weeping and waiting with
her sons on her breast. What shall the end be? The world-old and fearful
things, War and Wealth, Murder and Luxury? Or shall it be a new thing—a
new peace and new democracy of all races: a great humanity of equal men?
