<p>Many causes have been assigned for the three days of race rioting,
from July 27 to 30 in Chicago, each touching some particular phase of
the general condition that led up to the outbreak. Labor union officials
attribute it to the action of the packers, while the packers are equally
sure that the unions themselves are directly responsible. The city
administration feels that the riots were brought on to discredit the
Thompson forces, while leaders of the anti-Thompson forces, prominent
among them being State’s Attorney Maclay Hoyne, are sure that the
administration is directly responsible. In this manner charges and
counter-charges are made, but, as is usually the case, the Negro is made
to bear the brunt of it all—to be “the scapegoat.” A background of
strained race relations brought to a head more rapidly through political
corruption, economic competition and clashes due to the overflow of the
greatly increased colored population into sections outside of the
so-called “Black Belt,” embracing the Second and Third Wards, all of
these contributed, aided by magnifying of Negro crime by newspapers, the
the formation of a situation where only a spark was needed to ignite the
flames of racial antagonism. That spark was contributed by a white youth
when he knocked a colored lad off a raft at the 29th Street bathing
beach and the colored boy was drowned.</p>
<p>Four weeks spent in studying the situation in Chicago, immediately
following the outbreaks, seem to show at least eight general causes for
the riots, and the same conditions, to a greater or less degree, can be
found in almost every large city with an appreciable Negro population.
These causes, taken after a careful study in order of their prominence,
are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Race Prejudice.</li>
<li>Economic Competition.</li>
<li>Political Corruption and Exploitation of Negro Voters.</li>
<li>Police Inefficiency.</li>
<li>Newspaper Lies about Negro Crime</li>
<li>Unpunished Crimes Against Negroes.</li>
<li>Housing.</li>
<li>Reaction of Whites and Negroes from War.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of these can be grouped under the same headings, but due to the
prominence of each they are listed as separate causes.</p>
<p>Prior to 1915, Chicago had been famous for its remarkably fair
attitude toward colored citizens. Since that time, when the migratory
movement from the South assumed large proportions, the situation has
steadily grown more and more tense. This was due in part to the
introduction of many Negroes who were unfamiliar with city ways and
could not, naturally, adapt themselves immediately to their new
environment. Outside of a few sporadic attempts, little was done to
teach them the rudimentary principles of sanitation, of conduct or of
their new status as citizens under a system different from that in the
South. During their period of absorption into the new life, their
care-free, at times irresponsible and sometimes even boisterous, conduct
caused complications difficult to adjust. But equally important, though
seldom considered, is the fact that many Southern whites have also come
into the North, many of them to Chicago, drawn by the same economic
advantages that attracted the colored workman. The exact figure is
unknown, but it is estimated by men who should know that fully 20,000 of
them are in Chicago. These have spread the virus o” race hatred and
evidences of it can be seen in Chicago on every hand. This same cause
underlies each of the other seven causes.</p>
<p><img src="Images/body.png" /></p>
<p>With regard to economic competition, the age-long dispute between
capital and labor enters. Large numbers of Negroes were brought from the
South by the packers and there is little doubt that this was done in
part so that the Negro might be used as a club over the heads of the
unions. John Fitzpatrick and Ed Nockels, president and secretary,
respectively, of the Chicago Federation of Labor, and William Buck,
editor of the <em>New Majority</em>, a labor organ, openly charge that
the packers subsidized colored ministers, politicians and Y.M.C.A.
secretaries to prevent the colored workmen at the stockyards from
entering the unions. On the other hand, the Negro workman is not at all
sure as to the sincerity of the unions themselves. The Negro in Chicago
yet remembers the waiters’ strike some years ago, when colored union
workers walked out at the command of the unions and when the strike was
settled, the unions did not insist that Negro waiters be given their
jobs back along with whites, and, as a result, colored men have never
been able to get back into some of the hotels even to the present day.
The Negro is between “the devil and the deep blue sea.” He feels that if
he goes into the unions, he will lose the friendship of the employers.
He knows that if he does not, he is going to be met with the bitter
antagonism of the unions. With the exception of statements made by
organizers, who cannot be held to accountability because of their minor
official connection, no statements have been made by the local union
leaders, outside of high sounding, but meaningless, protestations of
friendship for the Negro worker. He feels that he has been given
promises too long already. In fact, he is “fed up” on them. What he
wants are binding statements and guarantees that cannot be broken at
will.</p>
<p>With the possible exception of Philadelphia, there is probably no
city in America with more of political trickery, chicanery and
exploitation than Chicago. Against the united and bitter opposition of
every daily newspaper in Chicago, William Hale Thompson was elected
again as mayor, due, as was claimed, to the Negro and German vote. While
it is not possible to state that the anti-Thompson element deliberately
brought on the riots, yet it is safe to say that they were not averse to
its coming. The possibility of such a clash was seen many months before
it actually occurred, yet no steps were taken to prevent it. The purpose
of this was to secure a two-fold result. First, it would alienate the
Negro set from Thompson through a belief that was expected to grow among
the colored vote when it was seen that the police force under the
direction of the mayor was unable or unwilling to protect the colored
people from assault by mobs. Secondly, it would discourage the Negroes
from registering and voting and thus eliminate the powerful Negro vote
in Chicago. Whether or not this results remains to be seen. In talking
with a prominent colored citizen of Chicago, asking why the Negroes
supported Thompson so unitedly, his very significant reply was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Negro in Chicago, as in every other part of America, is fighting
for the fundamental rights of citizenship. If a candidate for office is
wrong on every other public question except this, the Negroes are going
to vote for that man, for that is their only way of securing the things
they want and that are denied them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The value of the Negro vote to Thompson can be seen in a glance at
the recent election figures. His plurality was 28,000 votes. In the
second ward it was 14,000 and in the third, 10,000. The second and third
wards constitute most of what is known as the “Black Belt.”</p>
<p>The fourth contributing cause was the woeful inefficiency and
criminal negligence of the police authorities of Chicago, both prior to
and during the riots. Prostitution, gambling and the illicit sale of
whisky flourish openly and apparently without any fear whatever of
police interference.</p>
<p>In a most dangerous statement, State’s Attorney Maclay Hoyne, on
August 25, declared that the riots were due solely to vice in the second
ward. He seemed either to forget or to ignore the flagrant disregard of
law and order and even of the common principles of decency in city
management existing in many other sections of the city.</p>
<p>All of this tended to contribute to open disregard for law and almost
contempt for it. Due either to political “pull” or to reciprocal
arrangements, many notorious dives run and policemen are afraid to
arrest the proprietors.</p>
<p>During the riots the conduct of the police force as a whole was
equally open to criticism. State’s Attorney Hoyne openly charged the
police with arresting colored rioters and with an unwillingness to
arrest white rioters. Those who were arrested were at once released. In
one case a colored man who was fair enough to appear to be white was
arrested for carrying concealed weapons, together with five white men
and a number of colored men. All were taken to a police station; the
light colored man and the five whites being put into one cell and the
other colored men in another. In a few minutes the light colored man and
the five whites were released and their ammunition given back to them
with the remark, You’ll probably need this before the night is
over.”</p>
<p>Fifth on the list is the effect of newspaper publicity concerning
Negro crime. With the exception of the <em>Daily News</em>, all of the
papers of Chicago have played up in prominent style with glaring,
prejudice-breeding headlines every crime or suspected crime committed by
Negroes. Headlines such as “NEGRO BRUTALLY MURDERS PROMINENT CITIZEN,”
“NEGRO ROBS HOUSE” and the like have appeared with alarming frequency
and the news articles beneath such headlines have been of the same sort.
During the rioting such headlines as “NEGRO BANDITS TERRORIZE TOWN,”
“RIOTERS BURN 100 HOMES—NEGROES SUSPECTED OF HAVING PLOTTED BLAZE”
appeared. In the latter case a story was told of witnesses seeing
Negroes in automobiles applying torches and fleeing. This was the story
given to the press by Fire Attorney John R. McCabe after a casual and
hasty survey. Later the office of State Fire Marshall Gamber proved
conclusively that the fires were not caused by Negroes, but by whites.
As can easily be seen such newspaper accounts did not tend to lessen the
bitterness of feeling between the conflicting groups. Further, many wild
and unfounded rumors were published in the press—incendiary and
inflammatory to the highest degree, a few of them being given below in
order to show their nature. Some are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>
Over 1,000 Negroes had been slain and their bodies thrown in “Bubbly
Creek” and the Chicago River.
<li>
A Negro had been lynched and hanged from a “Loop” building overlooking
Madison Street.
<li>
A white woman had been attacked and mutilated by a Negro on State
Street. A Negro woman had been slain, her breasts cut off and her infant
had been killed by having its brains dashed out against a wall.
<li>
A white child had been outraged by a colored man.
<li>
A white child had been kidnapped by a band of colored men and its body
later found, badly mutilated and dismembered.
</ul>
<p>Immediately following the riots, a white woman was murdered in
Evanston, Ill. Immediately the crime was laid at the door of a colored
man with whom the woman had been intimate a number of years. Pitiful
stories were told of the woman waiting fr hours on street corners for
“just one look at her Billiken-like, mulatto lover,” played up under
headlines such as “CONFESSION EXPECTED TODAY FROM NEGRO SUSPECT,” “NEGRO
SUSPECT RAPIDLY WEAKENING” and the like which clearly led one to believe
that the colored man was guilty. A few days later, in an obscure item on
an inside page, a short account was given of the release of the colored
suspect “because insufficient evidence to hold him” existed. A long
period of such publicity had inflamed the minds of many people against
Negroes who otherwise would have been unprejudiced. Much of the blame
for the riots can be laid to such sources.</p>
<p>For a long period prior to the riots, organized gangs of white
hoodlums had been perpetrating crimes against Negroes for which no
arrests had been made. These gangs in many instances masqueraded under
the name of “Athletic and Social Clubs” and later direct connection was
shown between them and incendiary fires started during the riots.
Colored men, women and children had been beaten in the parks, most of
them in Jackson and Lincoln Parks. In one case a young colored girl was
beaten and thrown into a lagoon. In other cases Negroes were beaten so
severely that they had to be taken to hospitals. All of these cases had
caused many colored people to wonder if they could expect any protection
whatever from the authorities. Particularly vicious in their attacks was
an organization known locally as “Regan’s Colts.”</p>
<p>Much has been written and said concerning the housing situation in
Chicago and its effect on the racial situation. The problem is a simple
one. Since 1915 the colored population of Chicago has more than doubled,
increasing in four years from a little over 50,000 to what is now
estimated to be between 125,000 and 150,000. Most of them lived in the
area bounded by the railroad on the west, 30th Street on the north, 40th
Street on the south and Ellis Avenue on east. Already overcrowded this
so-called “Black Belt” could not possibly hold the doubled colored
population. One cannot put ten gallons of water in a five-gallon pail.
Although many Negroes had been living in “white” neighborhoods, the
increased exodus from the old areas created an hysterical group of
persons who formed “Property Owners’ Associations” for the purpose of
keeping intact white neighborhoods. Prominent among these was the
Kenwood-Hyde Park Property Owners’ Improvement Association, as well as
the Park Manor Improvement Association. Early in June the writer, while
in Chicago, attended a private meeting of the first named at the Kenwood
Club House, at Lake Park Avenue and 47th Street. Various plans were
discussed for keeping the Negroes in “their part of the town,” such as
securing the discharge of colored persons from positions they held when
they attempted to move into “white” neighborhoods, purchasing mortgages
of Negroes buying homes and ejecting them when mortgage notes fell due
and were unpaid, and many more of the same caliber. The language of many
speakers was vicious and strongly prejudicial and had the distinct
effect of creating race bitterness.</p>
<p>In a number of cases during the period from January, 1918, to August,
1919, there were bombings of colored homes and houses occupied by
Negroes outside of the “Black Belt.” During this period no less than
twenty bombings took place, yet only two persons have been arrested and
neither of the two has been convicted, both cases being continued.</p>
<p>Finally, the new spirit aroused in Negroes by their war experiences
enters into the problem. From Local Board No. 4, embracing the
neighborhood in the vicinity of State and 35th Streets, containing over
30,000 inhabitants of which fully ninety per cent are colored, over
9,000 men registered and 1,850 went to camp. These men, with their new
outlook on life, injected the same spirit of independence into their
companions, a thing that is true of many other sections of America. One
of the greatest surprises to many of those who came down to “clean out
the niggers” is that these same “niggers” fought back. Colored men saw
their own kind being killed, heard of many more and believed that their
live; and liberty were at stake. In such a spirit most of the fighting
was done.</p>
