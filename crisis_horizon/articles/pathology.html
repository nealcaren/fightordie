<p class="small"><strong>Abstract: </strong><em>The attitude of races to
one another has given rise to much speculation, and many writers have
maintained that men do not differ greatly from ants in their
antipathies. Race hatred is so strong among ants that their battles can
be arranged with certainty by entomologists for the movies. A more
flattering view of human prejudices is here suggested; for if they are
chiefly due to psychopathology there is hope that with the progress of
science a somewhat more rational attitude may eventually
prevail.</em></p>

Negro-in-America, therefore, is a form of insanity that overtakes white
men.” —<em>The Southerner</em>, by Walter Hines Page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the statement above makes no claim to technical exactness,
it is nevertheless confirmed by modern studies of insanity. If, in
developing this thesis, we consider some of the newer conceptions of
mental processes as they apply to abnormal Behavior, we shall find in
each case that the behavior motivated by race prejudice shows precisely
the same characteristics as that ascribed to insanity. This does not
refer, of course, to those phenomena of insanity due to abnormalities of
the actual structure of the brain, nor does it refer to the changes that
come in dementia. We are concerned here chiefly with the psychological
approach to the problem of insanity,—for race prejudice is an acquired
psychological reaction, and there is no scientific evidence that it
represents the functioning of inherited behavior patterns. Even from a
practical viewpoint, as we shall attempt to show, we are forced to
regard certain manifestations of race prejudice as abnormal
behavior.</p>
<p>The conception used to explain abnormal behavior which we shall
consider first is dissociation of consciousness. Normally, the mental
life appears to be a “homogeneous stream progressing in a definite
direction toward a single end”, as Dr. Hart puts it. That this apparent
homogeneity is deceptive, even in normal minds, is shown by a little
observation. Every one has had the experience of performing a task while
engaged in an unrelated train of thought. In cases such as this the
dissociation is temporary and incomplete, while in insanity the
dissociation is relatively permanent and complete. Automatic writing in
cases of <span id="Page_857" class="pagenum">[857]</span> hysteria,
somnambulism, dual personality, and delusions are cases of the splitting
off of whole systems of ideas. The conclusion of Hart that “this
dissociation of the mind into logic-tight compartments is by no means
confined to the population of the asylum” will lead us to those
manifestations of race prejudice that show the same marked mental
dissociation found in the insane. Herbert Seligman, in his book on the
Negro, suggests the insane nature of Southern reactions to the blacks
when he says, “The Southern white man puts certain questions beyond
discussion. If they are pressed he will fight rather than argue.”
Southern white people write and talk about the majesty of law, the
sacredness of human rights, and the advantages of democracy,—and the
next moment defend mob violence, disfranchisement, and Jim Crow
treatment of the Negro. White men and women who are otherwise kind and
law-abiding will indulge in the most revolting forms of cruelty towards
black people. Thus the whole system of ideas respecting the Negro is
dissociated from the normal personality and,—what is more significant
for our thesis,—this latter system of ideas seems exempt from the
control of the personality.</p>
<p>These dissociated systems of ideas generally have a strong emotional
component and are known as complexes. The Negro-complex,—the designation
which we shall give the system of ideas which most Southerners have
respecting the Negro,—has the same intense emotional tone that
characterizes insane complexes. The prominence of the exaggerated
emotional element has been noted by Josiah Royce in contrasting with the
American attitude the attitude of the English in the West Indies, who
are “wholly without those painful emotions, those insistent complaints
and anxieties, which are so prominent in the minds of our own Southern
brethren.” Moreover, just as in the insane any pertinent stimulus may
arouse the whole complex, so any idea connected with the Negro causes
the whole Negro-complex to be projected into consciousness. Its presence
there means that all thinking is determined by the complex. For example,
a white woman who addresses a colored man as mister is immediately asked
whether she would want a Negro to marry her sister and must listen to a
catalog of his sins. How else than as the somnambulism of the insane and
almost insane are we to account for <span id="Page_858"
class="pagenum">[858]</span> the behavior of a member of a school board
who jumps up and paces the floor, cursing and accusing Negroes, the
instant the question of appropriating money for Negro schools is raised?
Likewise, the Negro-complex obtrudes itself on all planes of thought.
Health programs are slighted because it is argued Negroes will increase;
the selective draft is opposed because the Negro will be armed; woman
suffrage is fought because colored women will vote. In many other cases
the behavior of white people toward life in general is less consciously
and less overtly influenced by the Negro-complex. Bitter memories quite
often furnish its emotional basis while the complex itself is elaborated
by ideas received from the social environment.</p>
<p>There is a mistaken notion, current among most people, that the
insane are irrational, that their reasoning processes are in themselves
different from those of normal people. The insane support their
delusions by the same mechanism of rationalization that normal people
employ to support beliefs having a non-rational origin. The delusions of
the insane, however, show a greater imperviousness to objective fact.
The delusions of the white man under the influence of the Negro-complex
show the same imperviousness to objective facts concerning the Negro. We
have heard lately an intelligent Southern white woman insisting that
nine-tenths of all Negroes have syphilis, in spite of statistical and
other authoritative evidence to the contrary. Moreover, just as the
lunatic seizes upon every fact to support his delusional system, the
white man seizes myths and unfounded rumors to support his delusion
about the Negro. When the lunatic is met with ideas incompatible with
his delusion he distorts facts by rationalization to preserve the inner
consistency of his delusions. Of a similar nature is the argument of the
white man who declares that white blood is responsible for character and
genius in mixed Negroes and at the same time that white blood harms the
Negroes! Pro-slavery literature denying the humanity of the Negro, as
well as contemporary Southern opinion supporting lynching and
oppression, utilizes the mechanism of rationalization to support
delusions.</p>
<p>Race prejudice involves the mental conflict, which is held to be the
cause of the dissociation of ideas so prominent in insanity. The
Negro-complex is often out of harmony with the personality <span
id="Page_859" class="pagenum">[859]</span> as a whole and therefore
results in a conflict that involves unpleasant emotional tension. In
everyday life such conflicts are often solved by what,—in those
following contradictory moral codes,—is generally known as hypocrisy.
When, however, the two systems of incompatible ideas cannot be kept from
conflict, the insane man reconciles them through the process of
rationalization. Through this same process of rationalization, the
Southern white man creates defenses for his immoral acts, and lynching
becomes a holy defense of womanhood. That the alleged reasons for
violence are simply defense mechanisms for unacceptable wishes is shown
by a case in which a juror was lynched for voting to exonerate a Negro
accused of a crime! The energetic measures which Southerners use to
prevent legal unions of white with colored people look suspiciously like
compensatory reactions for their own frustrated desires for such unions.
Other forms of defense mechanisms appear in the Southerner’s
sentimentalizing over his love for the Negro and the tendency in the
South to joke about him,—which has a close parallel in the humor of the
alcoholic. At the basis of these unacceptable ideas, requiring
rationalizations and other forms of defense mechanisms to bring them
into harmony with the personality, we find fear, hatred, and sadism
constantly cropping out.</p>
<p>When one surveys Southern literature dealing with the Negro, one
finds him accused of all the failings of mankind. When we reflect,
however, that the Negro, in spite of his ignorance and poverty, does not
in most places contribute more man his share to crime and,—even in the
opinion of his most violent disparagers,—possesses certain admirable
qualities, we are forced to seek the cause of these excessive
accusations in the minds of the accusers themselves. Here, too, we find
striking similarities to the mental processes of the insane. Where the
conflict between the personality as a whole and the unacceptable complex
is not resolved within the mind of the subject, the extremely repugnant
system of dissociated ideas is projected upon some real or imaginary
individual. Except in the case of those who, as we have seen, charge the
Negro with an inherent impulse to rape as an unconscious defense of
their own murderous impulses, the persistence,—in the face of contrary
evidence,—of the delusion that the Negro is a ravisher can only be taken
as a projection. <span id="Page_860" class="pagenum">[860]</span>
According to this view, the Southern white man, who has,—arbitrarily
without censure,—enjoyed the right to use colored women, projects this
insistent desire upon the Negro when it is no longer socially approved
and his conscious personality likewise rejects it. Like the lunatic, he
refuses to treat the repugnant desire as a part of himself and
consequently shows an exaggerated antagonism toward the desire which he
projects upon the Negro. A case has come to the attention of the writer
which shows clearly the projection of the unacceptable wish. A telephone
operator in a small Southern city called up a Negro doctor and told him
that some one at his home had made an improper proposal to her. Although
the physician protested that the message could not have come from his
house the sheriff was sent to arrest him. His record in the town had
been conspicuously in accord with the white man’s rule about the color
line. He had consistently refused to attend white men, not to mention
white women, who had applied to him for treatment. Unable, in spite of
his record, to escape arrest, he sought the aid of a white physician.
The whole matter died down suddenly, the white physician explaining to
his colored colleague that he had gone to the operator and found that
she was only “nervous” that day. To those who are acquainted with the
mechanism of projection, such a word as “nervous” here has a deeper
significance.</p>
<p>The mechanism of projection is also seen in the general disposition
of Southern white men to ascribe an inordinate amount of fear to
Negroes. That the Negro has no monopoly of fear was admirably
demonstrated in Atlanta, where, a year or so ago, white people were
fleeing from a haunted road while Negroes were coolly robbing
graveyards! This same mental process would explain why white men
constantly lay crimes to Negroes when there is no evidence whatever to
indicate the race of the criminal. Can we not find here also an
explanation of the unwarranted anxiety which white men feel for their
homes because of the Negro? Is this another projection of their own
unacceptable complexes? In the South, the white man is certainly a
greater menace to the Negro’s home than the latter is to his.</p>
<p>We must include in our discussion two more aspects of the behavior of
the insane that find close parallels in the behavior of those under the
influence of the Negro-complex. We meet in <span id="Page_861"
class="pagenum">[861]</span> insane with a tendency on the part of the
patient to interpret everything that happens in his environment in terms
of his particular delusion. In the case of those suffering from the
Negro-complex we see the same tendency at work. Any recognition accorded
the Negro, even in the North, is regarded as an attempt to give him
“social equality”, the personal connotations of which are familiar to
most Americans. In the South, Negroes have been lynched for being
suspected of such a belief. Misconstructions such as are implied in the
Southern conception of social equality are so manifestly absurd that
they bear a close resemblance to the delusions of reference in the
insane. Perhaps more justly to be classed as symptoms of insanity are
those frequent hallucinations of white women who complain of attacks by
Negroes when clearly no Negroes are involved. Hallucinations often
represent unacceptable sexual desires which are projected when they can
no longer be repressed. In the South a desire on the part of a white
woman for a Negro that could no longer be repressed would most likely be
projected,—especially when such a desire is supposed to be as horrible
as incest. It is not unlikely, therefore, that imaginary attacks by
Negroes are often projected wishes.</p>
<p>The following manifestation of race prejudice shows strikingly its
pathological nature. Some years ago a mulatto went to a small Southern
town to establish a school for Negroes. In order not to become persona
non grata in the community, he approached the leading white residents
for their approval of the enterprise. Upon his visit to one white woman
he was invited into her parlor and treated with the usual courtesies
shown visitors; but when this woman discovered later that he was
colored, she chopped up the chair in which he had sat and, after pouring
gasoline over the pieces, made a bonfire of them. The pathological
nature of a delusion is shown by its being out of harmony with one’s
education and surroundings. For an Australian black fellow to show
terror when he learns his wife has touched his blanket would not evince
a pathological state of mind; whereas, it did indicate a pathological
mental state for this woman to act as if some mysterious principle had
entered the chair.</p>
<p>From a practical viewpoint, insanity means social incapacity.
Southern white people afflicted with the Negro-complex show <span
id="Page_862" class="pagenum">[862]</span> themselves incapable of
performing certain social functions. They are, for instance, incapable
of rendering just decisions when white and colored people are involved;
and their very claim that they “know” and “understand” the Negro
indicates a fixed system of ideas respecting him,—whereas a sane and
just appraisal of the situation would involve the assimilation of new
data. The delusions of the sane are generally supported by the herd,
while those of the insane are often antisocial. Yet,—from the point of
view of Negroes, who are murdered if they believe in social equality or
are maimed for asking for an ice cream soda, and of white people, who
are threatened with similar violence for not subscribing to the
Southerner’s delusions,—such behavior is distinctively antisocial. The
inmates of a madhouse are not judged insane by themselves, but by those
outside. The fact that abnormal behavior towards Negroes is
characteristic of a whole group may be an example illustrating
Nietzsche’s observation that “insanity in individuals is something
rare,—but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule.”</p>
