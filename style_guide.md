## Markdown Style

Small caps, such as <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span>, is implemented with:

    <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span>

For  quotes that run more than one paragraph, use a non-printing space between each paragraph to preserve the indent. Additionally, each line, except the last, should end with two spaces.

    > Paragraph 1  
    > &nbsp;  
    > Paragraph 1
