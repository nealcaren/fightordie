C[ONNECTIONS AT]{.epub-sc} H[OME AND]{.epub-sc} A[BROAD]{.epub-sc}

N[INA]{.epub-sc} Y[OLANDE]{.epub-sc} Du Bois's role as an effaced and
dutiful wife was not entirely of her own choosing. She possessed average
intelligence rather poorly served by mediocre schooling. She was a
caring, though perhaps not warm, woman, and certainly a loyal and
resourceful one. She was unsure of herself both among strangers and in
the cosmopolitan world in which her husband increasingly spent his time.
Still waters run deep, yet by no stretch of feminist empathy could it be
claimed truthfully that Nina's depths yielded rich treasure. Even so,
there was probably a period after the death of Burghardt when her
talents and fragile self-confidence could still have been nurtured by
her husband: a time when, instead of becoming intimidated by scholarship
and causes, she might have learned to be comfortable with them. Nina
knew that Will cared for her and their daughter, and was as good as most
men of his generation about observing the special occasions of domestic
life. She knew also that Will saw marriage among prominent
African-Americans as an institution to be maintained, no matter what the
emotional cost, in order to negate white stereotypes about the black
family.

Perhaps she could have put her finger on some moment when the cord of
intimacy had finally snapped and she and her famous husband had learned
to conceal from each other their feelings of estrangement during those
increasingly rare times when they were together. But it is more likely
that they grew apart more gradually than Will's representation of it
(many years later, after the invisible Nina was dead) would have us
believe. Her letters to him give the impression that Nina tried over and
again to reach out to him, to engage Du Bois somehow and make him
recognize her as a person in her own right, rather than as an
abstraction and a significant, though uninteresting, extension of
himself. She made a bad job of it, usually. Although there were poignant
exceptions, the general run of her letters was one of narcotic banality,
relieved only by crises of health---her own and daughter Yolande's. The
""Dear Will"" salutations, followed by itemized accounts of her week, were
like heavy dough falling to a kitchen floor, thuds breaking the powers
of concentration in Vesey Street. ""Dear Will, I went to town yesterday
and bought thirty-four dollars worth of sheets, pillow slips, towels and
two bedspreads."" ""Dear Will, I have had to spend quite a bit for
Yolande's medicines and for things to eat for her, and I'm afraid I'll
run short before the first of the month."" ""Dear Will,"" Miss Pingree and
Mr. Dill were in good health, and ""we had a beautiful day yesterday for
Easter."" ""Dear Will,"" the family doctor thinks Yolande has a sprained
foot that ""she kept on usingÂ ... until the joints have become inflamed.""
Nina also worried about Will's health, and thought that he went ""too
long without eating very much and then eat\[ing\] too
much.""[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-1){#cha-1}

Sometimes she made a valiant effort to cross over into her spouse's
orbit of concerns; she wrote that ""we read and enjoyed"" the fiery ""Souls
of White Folk"" appearing in the [Independent]{.epub-i} on August 18,
1910. A few weeks later, she called his attention to a laudatory
newspaper editorial about him---""I suppose you've seen it."" Nina
expressed mild distress that there wasn't anyone ""so far directing the
work here that should be done for the opening of school,"" an
inconceivable state of affairs if Will had been on campus. She was sure
that the Howard University debating team had ""stolen"" its victory over
Atlanta. When Stephen Wise, the reform rabbi, leading American Zionist,
and founding member of the Committee of Forty, visited the campus with
his wife and spoke to the student body, Nina did her best to capture the
proud occasion. Rabbi Wise had discussed the stirrings in race relations
of which Will was an indispensable part. He spoke of their personal
friendship and of ""your worth to the negro,"" she wrote. ""But here is the
disappointing part of the visit,"" she complained, reverting to the usual
concerns: somehow she and Miss Pingree had missed the arrival of the
Wises' cab, although they had waited at the indicated spot for an hour.
Worse still, Yolande ""was not well as usual so was lying down she had a
headache so both Dr. and Mrs. Wise peeped in the bedroom at
Yolande.""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-2){#cha-2}

Busy hurling his editorial thunderbolts and carrying the new gospel of
civil rights far and wide beyond New York, Will let his correspondence
with Nina lag. ""I presume you will write to us some time,"" she
admonished mildly after weeks of silence. He failed to do better,
however. Since leaving them behind in August 1910, he found himself
tired, distracted, on the road, or constantly engaged. Throughout late
summer and into fall of 1911, Du Bois had worked what seemed a miracle
in bringing [The Crisis]{.epub-i} to life. He did manage to steal a few
days from the magazine to see in the New Year with Nina and Yolande in
Atlanta; but he was gone almost before his daughter realized he had been
there. ""Poor Yolande awoke about midnight after you left and cried
because she didn't see you before you left,"" Nina wrote. The family
physician diagnosed a ""lack of lime in her system"" when Yolande again
fell ill immediately after Will's departure. In fact, the illness was
another in a pattern of maladies for which medical explanations were
usually inadequate. Her child's confused mind may have told her that she
somehow caused her father's sudden leavings. When he dashed to New York
at Waiting's invitation to join the NAACP, Nina wrote Will that Yolande
had written him a letter, ""and then for some reason she decided she
wouldn't send it.""[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-3){#cha-3} In the
years ahead, his daughter would repeatedly try to capture his love and
attention by becoming sick or refusing to do what was expected of her.

The family's extended separation, then, was as much emotional as it was
geographical. Nina surrendered the keys to the South Hall apartment in
late May 1911 and left with Yolande, eventually to join Will in New
York; yet more and more he would manage to spend large blocks of time
away from them. The pace the editor had set himself left little time for
family. His first report to the NAACP directors on the activities of the
Department of Publicity and Research listed ninety-nine speeches
delivered to fifty-three mainly white and forty-six mainly black
audiences---a total of 35,000 people---during the period ending December
1911. Then, as he and Mary Maclean rushed the December 1911
[Crisis]{.epub-i} to press, he had somehow found time to prepare ""The
Rural South,"" a major paper on peonage, disfranchisement, and the
spreading socioeconomic decay of the South for the annual meeting of the
American Economic
Association.[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-4){#cha-4} There was no
immediate reunion in New York. Household goods had been shipped instead
from Atlanta to New Haven, Connecticut, where George W. Crawford, a
young Niagarite and Yale man from the South then embarking on an
outstanding career in law and real estate, apparently arranged for Nina
and Yolande to stay until permanent living accommodations could be
found. Will sailed for England in early June 1911 to address the Lyceum
Club, the British Sociological Society, and to participate in what he
believed was an epochal interracial congress in London. The
house-hunting during the late summer fell to Nina.

""I'm glad you had a pleasant voyage,"" she wrote him in London, as she
canvassed the few affordable neighborhoods in New Haven and New York
City open to respectable African-American families. There was so little
available and most of it was undesirable. Even if they could raise the
five-hundred-dollar down payment, she didn't at all care for ""those new
houses Mr. Crawford spoke to us about."" They had almost no front yards
and the streets were too
narrow.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-5){#cha-5} A rash of
municipal ordinances and restrictive covenants from Atlanta and
Louisville, Kentucky, to Baltimore and Providence, Rhode Island, was
suddenly making the housing situation for families like the Du Boises
much worse. The new codes and policies were drafted in response to the
migration from farm to town to city of poor and generally unskilled
African-Americans, unassimilated newcomers who, like many of their
""strange"" eastern and southern European counterparts, were regarded with
aversion (often bordering on hysteria) by much of Protestant white
America. In [The Sport of the Gods,]{.epub-i} one of the first works of
fiction dealing with urban life, Du Bois's Ohio intimate, the poet
Dunbar, had authentically described this raucous, black migrating mass
turning older, livable black communities into bursting slums. Talented
Tenth families who had lived and prospered for a generation now pushed
against the envelope of their ghettoes, trying to buy into healthier,
less-crowded living spaces occupied exclusively by white Americans. The
right to buy decent housing would be at the center of one of the NAACP's
first major court battles---the Louisville case of [Buchanan v.
Warley]{.epub-i}---one of its first paper victories before the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1917. But in the real world of real estate hypocrisy,
not even the editor of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} could do better than the
dogged Nina. The general manager of a model suburban community, the
Russell Sage Foundation Homes Company (the foundation itself had been
established to promote the welfare of African-Americans, Native
Americans, and other needy groups), would regret to inform Du Bois in
November 1912 that, after much deliberation, it had been decided that
""it would be a doubtful plan for you to settle in a communityÂ ... of
white people.""[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-6){#cha-6} The Du
Boises finally rented a small, neat house in the Bronx at 3059 Villa
Avenue.

Nina's worries tended to range from household needs to her daughter's
health, from cooking to covenants. Will took notice, expressed concern,
offered advice, and forwarded money. But his own preoccupations in the
summer of 1911 were far more lofty. They lifted him far above the plane
of the quotidian and the narrow. So compelling was the mission drawing
him to the United Kingdom, he thought, that members of the Niagara
Movement were sent a last-minute circular canceling his plans for
another annual meeting. Du Bois advised them to join the NAACP, which
most did, thereby definitively disbanding the first institutional
insurrection against Booker
Washington.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-7){#cha-7} For almost
two years, the British wing of the Ethical Culture movement, principally
guided by the boundlessly dedicated Gustave Spiller, had planned for an
ambitious ecumenical conclave, an unprecedented Universal Races Congress
embracing all the peoples of the planet. Kiplingesque sentiments about
parliaments of man in the federation of the world clearly inspired the
European and Eurocentric planners---an intellectual aristocracy
genuinely desirous of making the globe safe for imperialism with a human
face.

Du Bois had been urged to attend by Milholland, one of the initiators of
the Universal Races Congress (offering to pay his way), and to leave
early in order to undo the harm caused by the Wizard during his trip to
Great Britain the year before. In addition to speaking before the
Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society, the editor was to
enlighten the ladies of the highly influential Lyceum Club concerning
the true state of American race relations. But the long arm of Tuskegee
stirred up such commotion that Du Bois had tried to withdraw, until the
steadfastness of club president Dr. Ettie Sayer made him, as he wrote,
""feel like a deserter from the forefront of battle."" Milholland had also
rattled the members of the Anti-Slavery Society by telling its
distinguished secretary, Travers Buxton, that the object of Du Bois's
visit ""was definitely to oppose Mr. Washington's view."" Both
organizations were reassured. The upshot was that the editor delivered a
gracious Monday-evening dinner speech on June 26, attended, Du Bois was
pleased to recall forty years afterward, by the ranee of Sarawak, ""a
bishop and two countesses, several knights and ladies with Maurice
Hewlett and Sir Harry
Johnston.""[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-8){#cha-8} Truly alarmed
now, Booker Washington ordered Robert Moton to attend the Races Congress
and to do all he could to counter Du Bois. But after spending time with
Du Bois and Milholland and learning the gist of Du Bois's ""purely
impersonal---and very dignified"" address, Moton reported back to his
incredulous protector that there was no cause for
alarm.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-9){#cha-9} Moton had even
seconded the editor's statements when he followed him immediately to the
podium of the congress.

For Du Bois, however, the internationalizing of varsity combat with the
Tuskegee Machine was a secondary matter. For the remainder of his life,
he was incapable of discussing the Universal Races Congress without
recourse to superlatives, always insisting that ""it would have marked an
epoch in the racial history of the world if it had not been for the
World War."" Photographically preserved for [Crisis]{.epub-i}
subscribers, Du Bois stands erect, well tailored in the center of a good
gathering of the congress's savants and divines in front of the arched
gateway to the University of London, his incised goatee and upturned
mustaches accentuating the fine nose and perfect oval head. A thousand
delegates representing ""fifty races"" had assembled that Wednesday
morning, July 26, in Fishmongers' Hall for the Right Honorable Lord
Weardale's presidential welcome. Later many of them listened as Du Bois
recast Kipling's ""Recessional"" to fit this ""great and inspiring
occasion."" Elected cosecretary of the American delegation with Ethical
Culture founder Felix Adler, he greeted the first working session in the
great hall of the University of London with ""A Hymn to the Peoples,""
seven iambic stanzas considerably more distinguished for their elevated
sentiments than for the purity of verse.

[Truce of God! And primal meeting of the Sons of Man,]{.epub-i}

[Foreshadowing the union of the World!]{.epub-i}

[From all the ends of the earth we come!]{.epub-i}

....

[We be blood-guilty! Lo, our hands be red!]{.epub-i}

[Not one may blame the other in this sin!]{.epub-i}

[But here---here in the white Silence of the Dawn,]{.epub-i}

[Before the Womb of Time,]{.epub-i}

[With bowed hearts all flame and shame,]{.epub-i}

[We face the birth-pangs of a world:]{.epub-i}

....

[Save us, World-Spirit, from our lesser selves!]{.epub-i}

[Grant us that war and hatred cease,]{.epub-i}

[Reveal our souls in every race and hue!]{.epub-i}

[Help us, O Human God, in this Thy Truce]{.epub-i}

[To make Humanity
divine!]{.epub-i}[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-10){#cha-10}

He came before the congress twice again, once to deliver a scheduled
address in which he made a figurative bow to Tuskegee's philosophy of
uplift through enterprise while underscoring that ""intellectual
emancipation should proceed hand in hand with economic independence"";
and again to substitute at one of the main sessions for the renowned
gentleman ethnographer Sir Harry Johnston, stricken with tropical fever
from his sub-Saharan sojournings. Du Bois claimed that his speech
""gained wide reading."" His conviction seems curiously naive that ""a few
world congresses like this,"" assembling every four years, would have
changed history, but Du Bois held to the religion of ideas no matter how
passionately he came to embrace a program of action. Despite the
faith-shaking memory of Sam Hose's knuckles and the Atlanta litany, he
still wanted the Hegelian Real to fulfill the Hegelian Rational. Felix
von Luschan, a towering name in biology, came from Berlin to postulate
the ""monogenetic origin of humanity""---the emergence of all the races,
white, yellow, red, and black, from the same stock. Professor N. R.
D'Alfonso of Italy expatiated on the universality of ""psychological
possibilities""; history and culture, not innate differences, said he,
accounted for the great variety of human behaviors. From Brazil came Dr.
Jean-Baptiste De Lacerda, who praised, with qualification, the large
service rendered historically by the mixed races of his country. From
South Africa came Booker T. Washington's alter ego, the Bantu educator
J. Tengo Jabavu, who argued persuasively for the indigenous African
languages and traditions of his land. Felix Adler was convinced that the
greater the interaction of dissimilar peoples the greater the
understanding of the ""weak points in
each.""[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-11){#cha-11} Essentially the
same point was made to the delegates by West Africa's Dr. Mojola Agbebi.

""When fifty races look each other in the eye, face to face, there arises
a new conception of humanity and its problems,"" the editor rhapsodized
in [The Crisis.]{.epub-i} His old faith in the transforming potency of
the social sciences came flooding back. Religious dogmas, all the
delegates seemed to agree implicitly, had no legitimacy or place in
matters of serious social reform. The parasitic by-product of imperial
competition---finance capital---was devastatingly exposed and denounced
by the English economist John A. Hobson. In a similar vein, the elegant
Muhammad Bey Sourbour underscored the reality of imperial exploitation
by advocating for Egyptians some part ""in the making and execution of
laws."" The status of women in the world was systematically reviewed, and
the imperative moral and social justification for their liberation was
applauded. If Du Bois regretted that the global implications of the
""labor question"" and the time frame for the independence of India and
Egypt had not been addressed, he felt exhilarated, nevertheless, that so
many of the planet's great problems had been earmarked for systematic
investigation.[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-12){#cha-12}

But there was another reason for his euphoria. The Universal Races
Congress appealed to Du Bois's elitism and flattered his self-conceit.
If the Talented Tenth could deliver Afro-America from ignorance and
persecution, then surely this multiracial parliament of the world's
illustrious had the potential to do the same for mankind. ""The personnel
of the Congress was marvelous."" ""The two Egyptian Beys were evidently
negroid, the Portuguese was without a doubt a mulatto, and the Persian
was dark enough to have trouble in the South."" A Japanese
parliamentarian, another from the Cape Colony (its only black member), a
Sioux from the United States, the Liberian secretary of state, Mrs.
Annie Besant of the mystical Theosophical Society, who gave a fiery
critique of the British Empire, and the novelist and Zionist Israel
Zangwill, who was a highly interested spectator, especially caught Du
Bois's attention. The anarchist Russian prince, Pyotr Kropotkin,
attended most of the sessions. (When Kropotkin was told that Du Bois was
a radical and Washington a conservative, he exclaimed that he couldn't
imagine what a black person had to
conserve.)[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-13){#cha-13} Observing
her friends elation during these days in London, Mary Ovington was
impressed by how at ease and buoyant Du Bois was as he strolled in the
countess of Warwick's topiary gardens in evening dress, the beautiful
young daughter of General Legitime, Haiti's president, on his arm, a
wisp from his Benson and Hedges cigarette curling above them. Ovington
thought the sylphlike Mademoiselle Legitime was stunning: ""As she walked
across the perfect English lawnÂ ... she might have been a young queen
honoring England with her visit.""

On another gossamer night---the last night of the congress---Ovington
turned from Milholland to see her friend descending the ballroom steps
with another woman of remarkable beauty and culture. Totally absorbed in
each other, the two glided beneath the brilliant chandeliers onto the
polished floor and into the glittering gathering. ""They were talking
earnestly, of course of the race problem,"" and Ovington ""thought her the
loveliest person there, except perhaps the darker daughter of the
Haitian president."" Neither she nor Du Bois ever identified the woman of
the occasion. His significance to this cosmopolitan femme fatale or to
the French-educated Mademoiselle Legitime, for that matter, is also
unknown, but their company made an impression upon Du Bois that was
agreeably lasting. Ovington was absolutely positive that the lady of the
ballroom was the model for the protagonist of [The Dark
Princess,]{.epub-i} Du Bois's second novel, written seventeen years
afterward.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-14){#cha-14} This Races
Congress and its social setting were heady brew for a lonely, sensitive
genius, few of whose days ever passed without the stultifying intrusion
of racism into his private desires and professional achievements. In the
summer of 1911, Du Bois addressed respectful and illustrious Europeans,
embraced the hope that understanding between different peoples could be
advanced by a rainbow convention of intellectuals, and took a pleasant
furlough from skirmishes along the color line.

Little wonder, then, that he was almost as beguiled by the swan song of
the European world order as were the German professors and knighted
Englishmen present at the congress. Pax Britannica and free trade were
transforming the globe, linking the farthest outposts with the centers
of civilization and commerce. ""World peace, world organization,
conference and conciliation, the gradual breaking down of trade
barriers, the spread of civilization to backward peoples, the
emancipation of suppressed groups like the American Negro---seem\[ed?\]
to me the natural, the inevitable path of world progress."" But he would
come down to hard earth soon enough. Du Bois's powers of perception
invariably tamed his European susceptibilities. Three summers in the
future, he would write one of the twentieth century's most powerful
analyses of Europe's planetary spread into chaos. Then, he would see in
retrospect that the [Panther]{.epub-i} incident, occurring some three
weeks before the Races Congress convened, had been ""the forewarning of
coming doom."" On the pretext of protecting German interests from the
encroaching French in Morocco, a German gunboat had sailed into the port
of Agadir, creating what diplomats called the Second Moroccan Crisis.
But as Du Bois sailed for New York, he described his mood as thoroughly
sanguine. ""I fancied at the time that I knew my Europe pretty well,"" he
boasted, ""but familiarity with the dangers of the European scene had
bred contempt of
disaster.""[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-15){#cha-15} Plans for a
second Races Congress in Paris were to be aborted by an assassin's
bullet in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.

Du Bois came home to the heating up of quadrennial presidential politics
and would soon ask his readers to gamble on Woodrow Wilson. He came home
also to what was for him a major literary event, the publication that
October of his first novel, [The Quest of the Silver Fleece.]{.epub-i}
By the winter of 1911, only a few months away from his forty-third
birthday, Du Bois was so well known and admired among growing numbers of
African-Americans that clubs bearing his name had sprung up. The Du Bois
Club in Detroit was already nine years old, and another had been started
more recently at Cornell University. Most members of the Du Bois clubs,
like much of the general public, would have been surprised to learn that
the austere editor who wrote empirical studies of the race, championed
Latin and philosophy in the college curriculum, and disdained the
evangelism of the black church was really ""a poet and a dreamer."" Yet
that description, from a letter by a reader of manuscripts to Du Bois's
publisher, was accurate and revealing. The soaring expectations for the
Races Congress and the themes in [The Quest of the Silver
Fleece]{.epub-i} had their source in that part of Du Bois's fecund
intelligence governed by imagination, intuition, and sentiment. The
landscape of black America was and would continue to be littered with
the emotional wreckage of men and women whose escapist dreams had
enveloped their shattered intellects and, on the other hand, of those
whose remorseless intellects had poisoned their dreams. With Du Bois,
however, the tension between the creative and the logical was generally
(but with notable exceptions) constructive, reciprocally enhancing.
Fanny Hale Gardiner, McClurg's reader of Du Bois's manuscript, finally
decided, after seeing two versions, that, despite its defects in ""style
and language"" and ""much less interesting"" second half, [The Quest of the
Silver Fleece]{.epub-i} deserved to be published because it was a
remarkable social novel by a ""poet"" and ""dreamer,"" cogently exposing the
""unscrupulousness and heartlessness"" of those who lived by
calculation.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-16){#cha-16}

Du Bois himself called [The Quest]{.epub-i} ""an economic study of some
merit."" His later emphasis upon its economic underpinnings sought to
excuse many of the first-novel flaws that Gardiner had sympathetically
enumerated for McClurg editor Francis Fisher Browne. Yet it would have
been entirely out of character for Du Bois not to have had large hopes
for [The Quest,]{.epub-i} not to have wanted it to be seen as more than
an economic treatise embellished by dialogue. In one form or
another---when not doing research, giving speeches, organizing the
Niagara Movement, or publishing two magazines---he had worked on the
novel over a period spanning more than five years. With a cocksureness
inspired by the success of [The Souls of Black Folk,]{.epub-i} he
appears to have promised to whip off a novel for Francis Browne in time
for the 1904 fall list. An early April letter from Browne complained
that Du Bois's failure to do so ""will leave us in pretty bad shape."" By
winter 1905, a first draft of ""Scorn"" had been sent to the McClurg
editors, who frankly confessed to Du Bois that they failed ""to get the
central thought of the story; the plot does not seem to advance and
fulfill itself in a logical
sequence.""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-17){#cha-17} Once the
manuscript for [John Brown]{.epub-i} was accepted by the Jacobs
publishing company, however, Du Bois reshaped and completed his novel.

By April 1910, Du Bois's manuscript was on Gardiner's desk, where it was
given a qualified approval, but with a caveat that David Graham
Phillips, the muckraking journalist and current bestselling novelist,
had published [Golden Fleece]{.epub-i} in 1903. Du Bois's final,
slightly amended title was faithful to the economic [idÃ©e
maÃ®tresse]{.epub-i} of the work, an idea that had become stronger as he
reworked the numerous plots in his large narrative. As his literary
executor, Herbert Aptheker, has noted, novels exploring market forces
were the rage of the day: Frank Norris's wheat novels ([The
Octopus,]{.epub-i} 1901, and [The Pit,]{.epub-i} 1903); James Allen's on
hemp ([The Reign of Law, A Tale of the Kentucky Hemp Fields,]{.epub-i}
1900); and Upton Sinclair's meat-packing exposÃ© ([The Jungle,]{.epub-i}
1906).[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-18){#cha-18} And there was
another type of commodity novel that was equally popular---white
supremacist fiction, of which [The Leopard's Spots: A Romance of the
White Man's Burden]{.epub-i} (1902) and [The Clansman]{.epub-i} (1905),
by Thomas Dixon, Jr., were outstanding contemporary examples. The few
reviews of [The Quest]{.epub-i} were kind, but sales were extremely
modest. The author's Boston friend, William Braithwaite, praised it in
[The Crisis,]{.epub-i} astutely comparing it with [The Pit.]{.epub-i}
The [Nation]{.epub-i} reviewer gasped over the machinations,
miscegenation, and misery, asking ""can these things be true?"" The
unsigned review in the [Independent]{.epub-i} was more impressed by the
author than by the novel, wondering ""What will not Professor Du Bois
write next?"" Perhaps the fact was sufficiently well known that reviewers
of [The Quest]{.epub-i} felt no need to mention that Du Bois had joined
the ranks of possibly the country's most exclusive twentieth-century
profession---the African-American novelist. After the publication in
1902 of Dunbar's [The Sport of the Gods,]{.epub-i} followed three years
later by Chesnutt's [The Colonels Dream,]{.epub-i} and the appearance in
1908 of [Pointing the Way,]{.epub-i} the last novel by the fiery, now
practically forgotten Baptist preacher Sutton Griggs, nothing else had
been published until [The
Quest.]{.epub-i}[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-19){#cha-19}

Based loosely on the classical myth from which the novel derived its
title, the plot weaves together black and white lives in the rural
South, Washington, DC, and New York. There are cynical, complicated
bargains between northern finance and southern politics, while black
characters of varying hues, class backgrounds, and principles struggle
simply to survive. At the heart of the novel is Zora, the beautiful,
untamed black girl, the ""heathen hoyden,"" pure and intrinsically
innocent though sexually exploited by local white men. She lives in the
deepest depths of the swamp with her mother, the aged, amoral witch
Elspeth (emblematic both of Medea and the pagan African past). There
Zora inveigles handsome Bles Alwyn (Jason), model student of Yankee
schoolmarms, to clear, plough, and plant seed in soil that ""was virgin
and black, thickly covered over with a tangle of bushes,"" and from which
(conjured by Elspeth) springs forth a golden green field of plants.
""Never before was such a magnificent beginning, a full month of other
cotton.""[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-20){#cha-20}

While the cotton ripens, the lovers attend the school run by Miss Sarah
Smith and her northern white helpers. Zora wonders why they should do
so, questioning what the white people can possibly teach her that she
hasn't already learned from the swamp and her native wit. Bles, the New
Negro (who steps out of ""Of the Coming of John,"" a cameo part in [The
Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i}), explains that the white people ""know
things that give them power and wealth and make them rule."" Zora's reply
echoes the argument Du Bois had first advanced in the essay
""Conservation of the Races,"" an argument that recurred in books like
[The Negro]{.epub-i} and [The Gift of Black Folk]{.epub-i} and many of
his shorter writings---the splendid, even superior, characteristics of
black folk. ""'No, no. They don't really rule; they just thinks they
rule. They just got things---heavy, dead things. We black folks is got
the spirit. We'se lighter and cunninger; we fly right through them; we
go and come again just as we wants to. Black folks is wonderful.'"" But
Bles, like Du Bois in his writings and speeches, tells Zora that the
feral energies and intuitive culture of the swamp must be tamed: ""'Even
if white folks don't know everything they know different things from us,
and we ought to know what they
know.'""[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-21){#cha-21} Zora and Bles
learn together happily at first in Miss Smith's school.

Verisimilitude and symbolism commingle here; Sarah Smith's school was
based on the Calhoun School, where Du Bois had directed research for his
1906 land tenantry study, later destroyed by the U.S. Department of
Labor. This rural version of an urban settlement house was the product
of a remarkable educational venture by two northern white women of
granite courage, Mabel Dillingham and Charlotte Thornton, who had
founded the Calhoun School in 1892 in Lowndes County, a retreat to which
Du Bois had beckoned Ovington to join him while completing the ill-fated
Lowndes County study, describing it as ""floods of sunshine, frost in the
morning air; good company, with some exceptions, and an excuse of most
interesting work."" Miss Smith's establishment, uncorrupted by servile
schemes, represents the uplift ideal in all its radiance. ""In her
imagination the significance of these half dozen gleaming buildings
perched aloft seemed portentous---big with the destiny not simply of a
county and a State, but of a race---a nation---a
world.""[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-22){#cha-22}

But the money promised her school by a multimillionaire widow in the
North has strings attached to it. A ""Negro education steering committee""
composed of northern notables rolls out of Jersey City aboard a special
train for fictional Toomsville to study Sarah Smiths academy. Du Bois's
caricature of the General Education Board and the Ogdenites is rather
wicked: Temple Bocombe, the sociologist, confident, after a weeks
reading about the race problem, that he ""understand\[s\] it thoroughly"";
the Rev. Dr. Boldish of ""St. Faith's rich parish""; Mr. Easterly, ""who
thought this a good business opportunity""; the Vanderpools (Mr.
Vanderpool ""inducedÂ ... to come by stories of shooting""); all
accompanied by ""the necessary spice of young womanhood."" John Taylor,
the northern businessman who grows richer by the day, is the catalyst of
the Negro steering committee, and Du Bois has him promise, ""'We'll see
that on such committee you Southerners get what you want---control of
Negro education.'""[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-23){#cha-23}

The novel weaves between fable and realism, the pastoral and the
picaresque; sometimes effectively, sometimes jarringly. As appealing as
the author makes Zora, her behavior often disconcerts the reader not so
much because it is erratic or capricious, but because it is too
violative of the logic of psychological development. The same Zora who
clings to her deep suspicion of the elaborate learning and rigid
institutions of Sarah Smith's world has the equivalent of a postgraduate
semester in Washington and New York as the maid of the rich, cynical
Mrs. Vanderpool. She takes to reading [The Washington Post]{.epub-i} and
gossiping ""with old Herodotus across the earth to the black and
blameless Ethiopians,"" then listening ""to Demosthenes and walk\[ing\]
the Appian Way with Cornelia---while New York streamed beneath her
window.""[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-24){#cha-24} [Deus ex
machina]{.epub-i} forces toss Du Bois's African-American characters
about like flotsam on a roiling sea; these mysterious and prerational
forces belong to some earlier phase of evolution, uninfluenced by those
forces generated by the impersonal workings of industrial capitalism.

The author gives frequent expression to his maverick socialism, as when
Zora steals the Cresswell's mule so she and Bles can plough and plant
for two days, or when, after a white teacher reproaches Zora for the
theft of her pin, she hisses: ""'But you don't need it; you've got four
other prettier ones---I counted.' 'That makes no difference.' 'Yes it
does---folks ain't got no right to things they don't need.'"" Near the
novel's end the exchange between Zora and a poor white mother echoed the
lost possibilities of agrarian populism at its finest: watching haggard
white mill hands and downtrodden black sharecroppers milling in a town
square, the white woman sighs, ""'Durned if I don't think these white
slaves and black slaves had ought ter git together.' 'I think so, too,'
Zora agreed.""[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-25){#cha-25} But the
theme of socialism in [The Quest]{.epub-i} is randomly presented and
undeveloped, like Du Bois's own real-life advocacy of the political
philosophy during this time.

Capitalist greed, by contrast, is amply described in the novel. The
moth-eaten Cresswell family owns the great plantation with its ""'signs
of taste and wealth. But it was built on a moan,' cried Miss Smith to
herself.""[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-26){#cha-26} An aging
land baron, Colonel Cresswell embodies the gentry of the Old South whose
economic rapacity is tempered by patriarchal conscience and status
anxiety. The colonel's son, syphilitic and heartless Harry, rushes
pell-mell into the new order of Wall Street, Montgomery, and Atlanta,
marrying Mary Taylor, a Bryn Mawr graduate and teacher at Sarah Smith's
school, thereby uniting the new-generation white people of both regions.
When Zora brings the bales of fabulous silver fleece from the swamp into
town for sale, the Cresswells claim it against fabricated debts. The
fleece, woven into a wedding gown, will caress the delicate frame of
Harry's bride. The fleece is the second bitter loss to civilization for
Zora. Bles had found her love unworthy after learning of the white men
in her past from ambivalent liberal Mary Taylor. Meanwhile, Taylors and
Cresswells, Smiths and Vanderpools, and other cardboard characters
representing the new alliance of gold and cotton grow rich at the
expense of tradition, decency, and democracy. The scenes in ""The Cotton
Corner,"" Du Bois's chapter on the market combine, struck many readers
knowledgeable about market transactions as vividly modern and realistic.
Rattled almost to the point of putting a bullet through his brain
because every Cresswell cent is at stake, Harry watches John Taylor at
the telegraph machine in a Montgomery hotel suite:

The ticker whirred, ""8?---9---9Â½---10."" Then it stopped dead. ""Exchange
closed,"" said Taylor. ""We've cornered the market all right---cornered
it---d'ye hear, Cresswell? We got over half the crop and we can send
prices to the North Star---you---why, I figure it you Creswells are
worth at least seven hundred and fifty thousand above liabilities this
minute,"" and John Taylor leaned back and lighted a big black cigar.
""I've made a million or so myself,"" he added reflectively. Cresswell
leaned back in his chair, his face had gone white again, and he spoke
slowly to still the tremor in his voice. ""I've gambled---for
money---and---women---but---"" ""But not on cotton, hey? Well, I don't
know about cards and such; but they can't beat cotton."" ""And say, John
Taylor, you're my friend."" Cresswell stretched his hand across the desk,
and as he bent forward the pistol crashed to the
floor.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-27){#cha-27}

[The Quest]{.epub-i} is a sprawling novel---biracial, biregional, and
bisexual in the sense that characters of both genders play prominent
parts. As Arnold Rampersad, its keenest academic critic, concludes, [The
Quest]{.epub-i} is typical of the ""conflict between realism and romance
common in so much serious writing at the turn of the
century.""[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-28){#cha-28} And it is to
his women that Du Bois assigns the dominant, interesting parts. His men,
on the other hand, are relatively uncomplex, if not mechanical, whether
clever and ignoble like white John Taylor and Harry Cresswell,
respectively, or noble like Bles Alwyn and sleazy like Tom Teerswell, a
black political hack in the nation's capital, the setting for the second
part of the novel. Women possess vision, intelligence, and the capacity
to act---Zora, the protagonist, above all, and the cynical, delicious
Caroline Wynn, the well-connected Washington schoolteacher and
accomplished hostess ""sprung from at least three generations of
respectable mulattoes."" Whether Caroline Wynn was a composite
personality or based on an acquaintance of Du Bois's (perhaps the
novel's dedicatee ""To One Whose Name May Not Be Written""?), she and her
Washington circle may also have been suggested by another Harvard man's
social novel. Henry Adams's [Democracy]{.epub-i} (1880) comes to mind,
with its intellectual and disenchanted heroine, Madeleine Lee. Handsome,
possessed of an ""almost unconscious mental aggressiveness,"" and
well-educated, Caroline Wynn believes her life has been thwarted because
she is doubly cursed as a woman and a black person. Recognizing Bles's
great good heart and his ability to stir others by his moral
indignation, Caroline introduces him (along with Du Bois's white
readers) to Washington's pigmen-tocracy, its secret city of handsome,
cultured, tragic African-Americans now hidden in the deep shadows cast
by the afterglow of Reconstruction, a ""world-in-world with its accusing
silence, its emphatic self-sufficiency."" But Bles---""the Fool---and the
Man""---proves incorruptible in the face of a unique opportunity for
wealth and power through political skulduggery. With sadness but without
reluctance, Caroline Wynn of the Talented Tenth accepts the marriage
offer of Stillings, a backstairs creature on his way to white rewards
and clearly modeled on the Wizard. ""Bles, almost thou persuadest me---to
be a fool. Now go,"" says Miss Wynn as she shows the addled hero to her
parlor door with a farewell
kiss.[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-29){#cha-29}

[The Quest]{.epub-i} reflected the force and sincerity of Du Bois's
feminism, his credo that the degree of society's enlightenment and of
the empowerment of disadvantaged classes and races was ultimately to be
measured by its willingness to emancipate women---and, above all, black
women. What he would later affirm with pistol-shot accuracy was found on
virtually every page of the novel: that the race question was ""at bottom
simply a matter of the ownership of women; white men want the right to
own and use all women, colored and white, and they resent any intrusion
of colored men into this domain."" When Kelly Miller argued against votes
for women on the grounds that women need to be protected, Du Bois
heatedly dismissed the statement ""as sheer rot"" and the same sort of
thing ""that we hear about 'darker races' and 'lower classes.'"" Probably
with his own mother in mind, Du Bois had begun his earliest piece of
published fiction, a novelette in the Fisk [Herald,]{.epub-i} with the
sentence, ""It's hard to be a woman, but a black
one---!""[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-30){#cha-30} The main
character in that three-part [Herald]{.epub-i} novelette, ""Tom Brown at
Fisk,"" had been a woman, too, Ella Boyd, a summer schoolteacher, like Du
Bois, in the Tennessee backcountry. In [The Quest,]{.epub-i} Mary
Silvina, Ella Boyd, Du Bois himself, and the unforgettable Josie seem to
merge into the luminous Zora, symbol of the childhood of the race,
corruption in slavery, white-world skills and black-world intuitive
wisdom and humanity, and of the truly developed woman. Echoing Crummell
and reverberating in future African-American fiction and scholarship is
the conviction that the race will be saved by its Zoras, by the black
woman charting the course to culture, dignity, family, and
work.[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-31){#cha-31}

Not only is his main character female, but for the first time in
African-American fiction Du Bois created a heroine who is dark-skinned,
un-pedigreed, and sympathetic. Seeking what she repeatedly calls ""The
Way,"" Zora's intuition (for Du Bois, the trump card of ""racial""
faculties) slowly yet surely guides her through the swamp of
civilization (Washington and New York) and back to the South with money
in hand for Sarah Smith's school. In her dwelling, where all is harmony,
Zora displays her small treasure of books---the symbolic building blocks
of her new wisdom: Plato's [Republic,]{.epub-i} representing Du Bois's
conviction that the good society must be led by the broadly educated;
Tennyson's [Poems,]{.epub-i} underscoring Du Bois's belief, in
opposition to Plato, in the value of poetic vision in the republic;
Spencer's [First Principles,]{.epub-i} a salute to logic and
system-building applied to society; Gorky's [Comrades]{.epub-i} and
Balzac's novels, literature imbued with a social and moral perspective;
and an encyclopedia of agriculture, Du Bois's balancing concession to
the vocational idea informing Hampton and Tuskegee. [The Quest]{.epub-i}
ends with Zora in Bles's arms---both committed to a program of agrarian
self-sufficiency based on learning, cooperative labor, and a politics of
dignity and pragmatism. Du Bois places the last words of the novel in
Zora's mouth--- ""'Will you---marry me,
Bles?'""[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-32){#cha-32}

I[F]{.epub-sc} N[INA]{.epub-sc} D[U]{.epub-sc} B[OIS]{.epub-sc} ever
committed to paper any thoughts about her husband's first novel, they
have not survived. The unidentified person to whom he dedicated [The
Quest]{.epub-i} is almost certainly a woman, and it is absolutely
certain that Nina is not that person. None of the characters seems
likely to have been modeled on Nina, and her absence from [The
Quest]{.epub-i} seems to suggest her diminishing presence in Will's
emotional life. A theoretical feminist whose advocacy could erupt with
the force of a volcano (as in ""The Burden of Black Women"" in the
November 1907 [Horizon,]{.epub-i} or in ""The Damnation of Women"" in the
1921 collection of essays, [Darkwater]{.epub-i}), Du Bois proved to be
consistently patriarchal in his role as husband and father. The
all-too-commonplace truth is that he increasingly acted as a
well-intentioned tyrant at best and a bullying hypocrite at worst. Over
the next two years, when he found time to pay some attention to Nina and
Yolande he saw them as symbols---as Wife and Daughter, special enough,
to be sure, because they were [his]{.epub-i} wife and daughter, and
therefore the paradigmatic wife and daughter of the Talented Tenth. If
his expectations of Nina were narrow, they remained exacting. She had
the duty not to hinder his own private and public involvements and to
follow his prescriptions for their daughter's intellectual development.
His expectations of Yolande were as exalted as they were unrealistic.

Daughter Yolande was to be sacrificed time and again to the cruelest of
double standards. On the one hand, her life, like her mother's, was
controlled by the head of the family---a man whose faith in his own
wisdom was serene and always unequivocal; but, whereas other
late-Victorian husbands and fathers were determined to shelter their
womenfolk from overexposure to education and public life, Du Bois's
marching orders commanded Yolande to become superlatively educated and
emancipated. Her birthday fell in the same month McClurg published [The
Quest.]{.epub-i} She was only eleven, but the time had come for her to
recognize her father's high expectations. In Du Bois's vision, Yolande
was to mature into a wise and moral Zora endowed with the
cosmopolitanism of a Caroline Wynn. But there was surely something
more---the sublimation of a father's loss of a son through a daughter.
What the golden-haired Burghardt could have done, spunky Yolande would
do as well---and with less risk, because, although it was hard to be a
black woman, it was not usually fatal to be an intelligent, enterprising
one, as often was the case with black men. Du Bois had consoled himself
on his sons death with a ""Well sped, my boy, before the world has dubbed
your ambition insolence, has held your ideals unattainable, and taught
you to cringe and
bow.""[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-33){#cha-33} Yolande would
attain her goals and she would not cringe. He told her that
repeatedly---in letters, at the dinner table, and during those
increasingly rare bedtime sessions that she relished for the closeness
between them.

Du Bois prodded and exhorted Yolande to meet the challenge of the world.
Nina obediently repeated the catechism. Even so, as the months of school
terms passed, he felt that Yolande was slipping. He observed with
concern and annoyance her tendency to overeat and become flabby
(""nibbling and tasting all day""). She lacked motivation, discipline, and
needed outdoor exercise ""and training in games."" The worst of it was
Yolande's command of the language. It had been ""rather our pride a few
years back."" Of late, however, it had become ""very slovenly and
American,'"" he wrote to the headmaster of the English school in which he
contemplated enrolling her. In summer 1914, Du Bois convinced Nina that
their thirteen-year-old daughter should attend Bedales School in
Hampshire, one of England's first experimental country boarding schools,
in order to prepare for college. Bedales developed mind and character
through freedom of expression, group discussion, and pupil
self-government. It was the first public (i.e., private) school in the
United Kingdom to dare coeducation. As his letter of instructions to
Bedales headmaster John Haden Badley stipulated, although Du Bois did
not ""look for brilliance or genius,"" he wanted Yolande ""trained for
efficient work and not simply for
breeding.""[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-34){#cha-34}

On September 24, 1914, seven weeks after the outbreak of the European
war, Du Bois wrote a personal letter to William Jennings Bryan, now
Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State, requesting expedition of Nina's and
Yolande's passport applications. The matter was urgent, he explained to
Bryan, as his wife and daughter were booked to sail within days for the
United Kingdom. Ramsay MacDonald, leader of the Labour party and one of
Du Bois's many important Races Congress contacts, had been only too
happy to recommend Yolande to Bedales, where two of his sons were also
enrolled. Dr. Frances Hoggan, the old friend who had financed Du Bois's
summer trip to England in 1907, stood ready to help Nina find lodgings
in London after Yolande had settled in at Bedales. The organizer of the
Races Congress, Gustav Spiller, could be counted upon to encourage his
wife to draw Nina into her large, sophisticated social circle. A similar
welcome awaited her from the West Indian family of John Alcindor; an
organizer of the 1900 Pan-African Congress, Alcindor had a thriving
surgical practice in the borough of Paddington. From teenage worries
about an ""awfully rickety"" swing in the front yard (the topic of her
last letter to her father before leaving for England), Yolande was
transported to a foreign land and into vicissitudes she had never
imagined. She and Nina descended the gangplank of the [St.
Paul]{.epub-i} on October 6, 1914, to be met by a deputy U.S. consul at
Liverpool.[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-35){#cha-35}

Predictable letters filled with advice and instructions came from 70
Fifth Avenue, the new address of [The Crisis.]{.epub-i} On October 29,
Du Bois poured his thoughts into five full paragraphs, anxious that
Yolande comprehend fully the grand implications of her new life. She had
turned fourteen on Wednesday of the previous week. The letter was
classic. He had waited for his ""Dear Little Daughter"" to settle in. He
knew she missed the familiar, that all was ""new and unusual."" Probably
she was lonely and a little afraid. Above all, she must remember her
""great opportunity.""

You are in one of the world's best schools, in one of the world's
greatest modern empires.... You are there by no desert or merit of
yours, but only by lucky chance. Deserve it then. Study, do your work.
Be honest, frank and fearless and get some grasp of the real values of
life.... Remember that most folk laugh at anything unusual whether it is
beautiful, fine or not. You, however must not laugh at yourself. You
must know that brown is as pretty as white or prettier and crinkly hair
as straight even though it is harder to comb.... Don't shrink from new
experiences and custom. Take the cold bath bravely. Enter into the
spirit of your big bedroom. Enjoy what is and not pine for what is not.
Read some good, heavy, serious books just for discipline: Take yourself
in hand and master yourself. Make yourself do unpleasant things, so as
to gain the upper hand of your soul. Above all remember: your father
loves you and believes in you and expects you to be a wonderful woman. I
shall write each week and expect a weekly letter from you. Lovingly
yours, Papa.[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-36){#cha-36}

Less than two weeks later, Yolande received a second editorial. Her
father was pleased that she was liking Bedales. He promised her a watch
and riding lessons, if he could stand the expense. ""But most and
foremost---lessons, lessons, lessons! Learn, learn, learn!"" She must
read English, French, and German history in order to ""see the reasons of
this war."" Finally, he enclosed the latest [Crisis]{.epub-i} ""because it
is about our people---your people and mine, whom we must love and of
whom we must be proud."" Yolande should ""show it to the girls and never
be ashamed of your folk."" There was a barrage of such letters throughout
1915.[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-37){#cha-37}

Meanwhile, Nina husbanded her pounds sterling (""not complaining, I'm
simply telling you how I've spent the money""), kept track of Yolande
(reporting that her combs and brushes had been stolen and that her feet
and hands were swelling), and suffered in a London suburb from the
miserable English weather. The best lodging she could find was a
boarding house in High Barnet, a part of London beyond the Underground,
where she had to share a drab room with another woman. Nina's mood
became as grey and heavy as London's winter cloud-cover. Coal for the
little stove was in short supply and she suffered constantly from the
penetrating damp. She was going to have to buy heavier clothing; there
was no sign of her furs. They must be ""at the bottom of the ocean,"" she
sighed to Will in early February 1915. All the English people she met
knew, despite the news blackout, that U-boats were taking a heavy toll
of shipping in the Atlantic. Yolande's Christmas visit had been
especially hard. They had had to double up in the poorly heated room and
""Ouchie"" (Yolande's Bedales nickname, explained by her tender
extremities) consumed enormous amounts of scarce, expensive meat and
vegetables. ""I'm sorry to have to trouble you about money matters again
but I must"" became a refrain in Nina's letters
home.[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-38){#cha-38}

She felt she had to have her own room despite the weekly cost of a few
shillings more. Although the private room was much better heated, Nina's
physical condition deteriorated. ""I can't get on on the average English
meals""---she ate them but couldn't ""digest them."" She assured Will that
she was doing her best ""to get my stomach straightened out, am living
mostly on eggs and milk, oil, etc."" Frances Hoggan had prescribed this
diet, but as the weeks passed there was only a slight improvement in
Nina's condition. She was spending most of her days resting. Her eyes
troubled her a great deal in early March 1915, but the tone of her
letters over the period of a year suggests that boredom and cold were
the worst of it. ""Dear Will, There isn't anything new happening with
us,"" she sighed on March 5, 1916. ""We have been having some snow and
cold in London but on the whole it has not been a cold winter, still one
is always more or less cold here."" Will received detailed accounts of
board and dietary expenditures, but he must appreciate that the ""change
of food and climate and the living in general reduced my strength
considerable \[sic\]Â ... as I had none too much to start with."" In that
same letter she thanked Will for sending the latest [Crisis]{.epub-i}
and for taking the time ""to tell me about your own speech"" at the NAACP
meeting. She was genuinely grateful because she realized how monumental
his concerns were, how unyielding his self-imposed regime. One of Will's
earliest letters, a chatty one about Augustus Dill, Monroe Trotter,
Woodrow Wilson, and ""our ups and downs in the Association,"" had been
dictated with an apology: ""You will have to pardon this machine-made
letter. My left hand is so tired that I have not been using it for a few
days.""[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-39){#cha-39}

Gradually, she grew stronger and began to get about. She enjoyed Dr.
Hoggan's club and Mrs. Spiller's at-home, but they, the
Coleridge-Taylors, and others who took an interest in her well-being
lived in central London, a long, expensive double-decker ride (forty
pence) from High Barnet---a trip too long and too taxing on her delicate
health to make often. And besides, she added, ""London is one dirty
city."" She was lonely. Aida Young, the wife of Major Charles Young,
Will's old friend from Wilberforce, was not expected to pass through
London from Liberia until late May. The U-boats prevented the regular
arrival of her [Independent.]{.epub-i} Her furs, although fortunately
insured by Will through Wanamaker's, were definitely lost at sea.
Zeppelins were beginning to bomb the city. Racial prejudice prevented a
change of address. The places that ""were comfortable and reasonable in
price won't accommodate colored people \[and\] other places are very
expensive or very
dirty.""[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-40){#cha-40} Then, finally,
toward the end of March 1915, just before Yolande's Easter vacation,
Nina found a large, comfortable room at 13 Chepstow Place in Bayswater
for ten shillings and sixpence weekly. When Yolande came down from
Bedales, Nina held her breath. Mrs. Turner, the very proper Bayswater
landlady, enforced strict rules of conduct. Yolande's manners had been
disagreeable, altogether insolent during the Christmas vacation, Nina
reported. ""I was always wondering what she would say and do
next.""[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-41){#cha-41}

A taller, thinner Yolande arrived in Chepstow Place as hard as ever to
satisfy, and at about the same time the back issues of the
[Independent]{.epub-i} came in a bundle. Dr. Hoggan called on them,
recommended a specialist for Yolande's blistered feet (the English
climate was the culprit), and brought Nina news that she had full
privileges in the Emerson Club. They spent time in Kensington Park,
which was within walking distance of their boarding house, saw [Peg O My
Heart]{.epub-i} (""a pretty light play \[but\] Yolande enjoyed Peg very
much""), took in Madame Tussaud's wax museum, and visited the Spillers.
She wrote Will that Bedales said Yolande was ""as good as gold."" Nina
said she was frankly suspicious---the report ""readsÂ ... almost too
good."" Bedales was a fine place and she was certainly no expert in these
matters, but Nina didn't think ""they require as much of the pupils here
as they do in the schools at home."" The head matron sent word that
Yolande appeared to be unhappy. Maybe she wasn't [that]{.epub-i} unhappy
because Yolande ""had a way of not expressing herself,"" Nina reminded
Will, but it certainly was true that, except for one Belgian student,
""Ouchie"" didn't ""take to the girls and of course she hates the boys.""
Yolande was cagey, disinclined to show her true feelings. She refused to
say ""right out one way or the other,"" so Nina had to declare that she
""really could not form any opinion"" about Yolande's adjustment at the
school.[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-42){#cha-42} Their daughter
not only wanted nothing to do with the war (she refused to read anything
about it), Nina was afraid Yolande was uninterested in almost
everything---sports, hobbies, studies, people her age, travel, reading.

Nina didn't want to worry Will, especially as he had written that he was
about to take a brief vacation in Jamaica. She had been so relieved that
he was trying to pace himself after finishing his new book, [The
Negro,]{.epub-i} the strain of the NAACP's fierce campaign against [The
Birth of a Nation,]{.epub-i} and his preparations for the Washington,
D.C., mounting that fall of [The Star of Ethiopia,]{.epub-i} his pageant
with a cast of hundreds. ""You've had such a full life for the last few
years,"" Nina was sure he needed to relax. Actually he was ""feeling in
pretty good shape,"" Will reassured her from his new home at 248 West
Sixty-fourth Street, ""but at the same time"" he agreed that he ""ought to
take a good rest so as to be ready for next year's work which is going
to be hard with the pageant and other things."" Yes, she was ""so sorry to
trouble"" him when he was ""so busy trying to make the work go and meet
expenses there in the office."" Yet how could they continue to afford
Bedales? Prices were rising steeply now, shortages were becoming acute.
Yolande's fees per term came to thirty-five pounds; her vacation
expenses were large; the boarding house was almost two pounds weekly,
everything included; and the specialists Dr. Hoggan referred them to
were bound to be expensive. Nina calculated a global sum approaching 360
pounds a year---1,800 dollars. Will's annual pay was 2,500 dollars. ""Dr.
Hoggan doesn't realize that your salary isn't enough to meet such
demands,"" she wrote
despairingly.[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-43){#cha-43}

As he left for Jamaica, Will sent a check for sixty pounds, astonishing
Nina with his promise to send sixty pounds every other month---nearly
1,800 dollars, which, somehow, he did. The Jamaica trip was something of
an event, with a garden reception hosted by Sir Sydney Olivier, the
royal governor, and press coverage of Du Bois's well-attended address.
He extended a receiving-line handshake to a short, very dark-skinned man
of remarkable intensity, one Marcus Mosiah Garvey, who later left his
calling card at Du Bois's stopping
place.[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-44){#cha-44} On this island,
the editor's reserve gave way almost to ecstasy as he described a jewel
""thrown on the face of the sea with gash and shadow and veil."" For the
first time in his life, he told [Crisis]{.epub-i} readers, ""I lived
beyond the color line."" It was as though God had decided to implement
the resolutions of the Universal Races Congress in ""a most amazing
land."" People of color ran the society---the mayor of Kingston, ""smart,
dark constables in gleaming white hats,"" department store and postal
clerks with ""a curl or tintÂ ... that proclaimed the most ancient of
blood."" Ecstatic but not blinded, Du Bois saw that the ultimate
political and economic power was wielded by the white people and
witnessed the ""tragedy of a poverty almost incomprehensible"" that
shackled the ""great mass of hard working black laborers."" Nevertheless,
Jamaica was ""the most marvelous paradox,"" even after three hundred years
in which the ""white world has reaped its millions."" It represented ""the
gift of racial peace, the utter overturning of the barbaric war of
color.""[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-45){#cha-45}

Jamaica amazed Will. Sixty pounds every second month amazed Nina,
prompting two unanswered inquiries that
June.[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-46){#cha-46} Mysteriously
relieved of money concerns, she put a brave face to other worries. The
war intruded. Outside the Medieval Flemish city of Ypres, the Allied and
German forces sustained colossal losses throughout April and May 1915.
When the generals ordered a pause in the slaughter, 250,000 British and
French soldiers were dead from bullets, shrapnel, and poison gas (used
by the Germans for the first time in warfare). The controlled British
press concealed the casualties, but families in mourning were ubiquitous
and there was much talk of ghastly numbers in clubs and pubs. The
sinking of the British ocean liner [Lusitania]{.epub-i} in early May
1915, resulting in 1,198 civilian fatalities (128 of them American
citizens), horrified the American and British public. Nina shared the
feelings of outrage---so much, in fact, that she refused her German
neighbor's invitation to walk in Regent's Park the morning after the
sinking. ""I thought it most too much,"" she tutted to Will. She made the
best of an alien, unsafe world. Zepellins were unloading more tonnage on
London now, Bedales teachers were reporting for military duty, and food
and fuel were much dearer. Even in the midst of the hazards, she wrote
that she was ""really just beginning to appreciate London"" now that she
was no longer ""half frozen or starved."" There were visits to the
Coleridge-Taylor and the Ira Aldridge families. Aida Young finally came
from Liberia, somewhat ill and the worse for wear, but full of news
about the war and determined to cross the Channel as soon as possible to
enroll her two children in a Paris lycÃ©e. ""Afraid to cross the Channel
now,"" Nina declined Aida's invitation. Charles Young had sailed directly
for New York and Nina advised Will not to breathe a word about the
former U.S. military attachÃ©'s poor health. ""Should you by chance write
to Major Young don't write anything very personal for it seems their
mail is all tampered with,"" she disclosed
darkly.[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-47){#cha-47}

Although life was much fuller and more agreeable, Nina remained deeply
troubled about Yolande. She clearly misread Headmaster Badley's progress
reports (they were less positive than she thought), but she sensed that
her tight-lipped daughter's emotions were in commotion. Nina wondered if
the cause was racial, and intimated that the daughter of W. E. Burghardt
Du Bois had not yet come to terms with her own identity. ""I know of
course she feels strange,"" Nina confided, ""and I presume, though she
wouldn't acknowledge it, that she's beginning to feel she's colored.""
She hastened to concede that Yolande was ""better off here than she would
be in America,"" yet both of them lived an odd existence among the
English. ""I have had people stare at me until I'm sure there is
something wrong with
me.""[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-48){#cha-48} But it was less
the rude racial customs of many Britons that bothered Nina than her
daughter's alternately withdrawn and surly response and mounting
insouciance about her education. Nina now felt that the Bedales
philosophy of progressive education was wrong for Yolande. If not
""rather firmly guided,"" she would be ""like many other colored girls I
know, especially colored girls whose way has been rather easy."" In a
remarkably perceptive letter of May 16, 1915, about Yolande's
deficiencies, Nina also poignantly evaluated herself, if only
subconsciously, as one of those women of color who ""suddenly find out
that they don't know anything and therefore can't do anything. Then the
whole world becomes a bore to them and they hate themselves for having
wasted their
opportunities.""[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-49){#cha-49}

Du Bois either genuinely missed the troubling implications of his wife's
reports or was too busy fully to appreciate them. Yolande had repeatedly
tried to fix her father's attention. Child psychologists today might
argue that the overeating, the vague maladies, and the periodic
disciplinary crises stemmed largely from her need for attention. Through
her mother she had asked him to renew her subscription to [St. Nicholas
Magazine]{.epub-i} in February 1915 and reminded him about the promise
of the watch. The watch came, but it is unclear whether Du Bois got
around to the subscription. ""Dear Papa,"" a note from Bedales bleated, ""I
haven't had a letter from you for years."" Even though Nina had told him
that their daughter ""won't read the war news or stories,"" Yolande,
hoping to draw a reply, asked, ""Do you think America'll join the war,
don't you think she ought to? I do."" Soon she wrote that the war had
come to Bedales. A Zeppelin passed over Bedales and dropped bombs not
far away. One Sunday Yolande felt so unfairly treated by her dormitory
matrons, she poured out her feelings to her father: ""P.S. I wish I'd
never seen England or Miss
Ruth.""[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-50){#cha-50}

Often when he attempted a fatherly letter, Du Bois was unsure of his
tone and phrasing. In a lengthy, typewritten description of Niagara
Falls that he had sent her four years earlier, pronouns were changed and
one or two signature forms tried out before the final WEBD. But this
time, in a July 15 letter, he found his most human, intimate voice,
telling Yolande about his personal vulnerabilities. The world was
unfair. Learning to get along without the things you wanted most was
part of growing up, he advised. Then came an uncharacteristic personal
revelation:

I remember when I was a little boy that there was one boy who lived near
me who was almost my only playmate. When, therefore, he got obstreperous
and cut at my fingers with a hatchet and was otherwise naughty, I had to
give him up. Oh! It was an awful time! I felt absolutely alone in the
world and then I began to see how I could arrange to play with myself
and I have been doing that largely ever
since.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-51){#cha-51}

Yolande wrote back that she was trying cricket. She didn't like it; the
boys bowled too hard. He must have wanted to continue the
correspondence, but his work in connection with [The Crisis]{.epub-i}
and the association kept him busy writing and constantly
traveling---fifty lectures in fourteen states in 1915, thirty-seven in
eight states the following year. The NAACP was becoming truly national
now, with branches set up across the country and plans for more in the
Deep South. Mary Maclean's unexpected death in July 1912 had affected Du
Bois profoundly (she may be ""The Princess of the Hither Isles,"" an
enigmatic, moving prose poem in the October 1913 [Crisis]{.epub-i}), but
the staff and magazine continued to grow (the average monthly
circulation reached thirty thousand in
1915).[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-52){#cha-52} There were only
insignificant parts available to Nina and Yolande in the drama starring
W.E.B. Du Bois.

During this time, in fact, the editor had transformed himself into a
stage director. Robert Wood, the African-American printer well connected
to Tammany Hall, had arranged for Du Bois's appointment to the New York
Emancipation Exposition Committee. The great success in 1913 of what
came to be called [The Star of Ethiopia,]{.epub-i} presented in the 12th
Regiment armory as part of New York's commemoration of the fiftieth
anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, had thrilled him. ""The
Pageant is the thing. This is what the people want and long for,"" he
exulted after some fourteen thousand men and women of both races had
filed through the armory that October. By early 1915, Du Bois was
determined to ""teach on the one hand the colored people themselves the
meaning of their historyÂ ... and on the other to reveal the Negro to the
white world."" The bishops of the AME church would invite the editor to
mount [The Star of Ethiopia]{.epub-i} in Philadelphia's Convention Hall
during the denomination's hundredth-anniversary general conference in
May 1916. The Philadelphia production ""in its smoothness and finish was
technically the best,"" Du Bois said years afterward, but the earlier
Washington, D.C., premiere in autumn 1915 was also such a success that,
as he exuberantly told [Crisis]{.epub-i} readers, he ""walked home and
knew the joys of God.""[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-53){#cha-53}
There would be a final Hollywood Bowl presentation in 1925.

Refining and enlarging the original 1911 draft (probably completed after
the Races Congress), he transformed [The Star of Ethiopia]{.epub-i} into
a three-hour extravaganza in six episodes, featuring a thousand
creamy-complexioned young women and tawny, well-built men, and flocks of
schoolchildren marching through history. The anticipated costs of the
Washington production ran to three thousand dollars, a sum well beyond
the NAACP's discretionary budget, but Du Bois somehow raised and risked
five hundred of his own dollars. At the last moment, ""a wonderful gift
of one young woman"" brought in another fifteen hundred dollars. The
pageant was supported by enthusiastic citizens' committees and
organizations (President Wilson's daughter Margaret lent her name to the
Washington pageant committee). Except for two selections from Verdi's
[Aida,]{.epub-i} Du Bois chose music composed by black men: Bob Cole,
Rosamond Johnson, Coleridge-Taylor, and Charles Young, his accomplished
army friend, who contributed a prelude and four additional pieces. Du
Bois described the act of creation in a tumult of [Crisis]{.epub-i}
prose: ""It sweeps you on and you hang trembling to its skirts. Nothing
can stop it. It is. It will. Wonderfully, irresistibly the dream comes
true."" Eight searchlights sliced the Indian summer night and six
thousand Washingtonians watched from bleachers in the American League
ballpark as trumpets blared and the stentorian voice of a herald
proclaimed from the steps of a papier-mÃ¢chÃ© Egyptian temple the six
gifts of ""the Eldest and Strongest of the Races of men whose faces be
Black. Hear ye, hear ye!"" Misses Adella Parks, Eleanor Curtis, and Mrs.
Gregory Fraser, representing Sheba, Ethiopia, and Meroe, respectively
(as well as the flower of Talented Tenth pulchritude), were serially
replaced center stage by a pharaoh, Mali's fourteenth-century Islamic
ruler Mansa MÅ«sÄ, Columbus's pilot Alonzo; moaning slaves in chains;
Spanish lancers; Toussaint L'Ouverture; Sojourner Truth; Frederick
Douglass; and, to the accompaniment of rolling drums, the Massachusetts
regiment of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw; followed by children, the
professions, and the working class. Iron and fire, the herald intoned,
was Africa's first gift to mankind, then came Egypt's civilization,
followed by Faith in Righteousness, then Humility, and the gift of
""Struggle Toward Freedom"" and finally ""the Gift of Freedom for the
workers""---all this in ""a great cloud of music that hovered over them
and enveloped them.""[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-54){#cha-54}

Local newspapers applauded the edifying message and ambitious scale of
the pageant and congratulations poured into [The Crisis]{.epub-i} over a
three-year period from leading citizens in New York, Washington, and
Philadelphia. The [Bee]{.epub-i} described the pageant as ""electrical,
spiritual."" ""All the GrimkÃ©s were enthusiastic,"" Archibald wrote Du
Bois. Another Washingtonian whose opinion Du Bois valued enough to
request it in writing, Dr. H. B. Humphrey, a white official of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, found the pageant full of ""interest and
delightful surprises."" Perhaps it was ""a bit too slow between parts to
support the interest of the average AmericanÂ ... used to things
mov\[ing\] before the eye with Kaleidoscopic regularity,"" Humphrey
wrote; nevertheless, it was certainly a force for breaking down
prejudice. Humphreys opinion is revealing, in light of the fascinating
fact that [The Star of Ethiopia]{.epub-i} was the most patent, expansive
use yet made by Du Bois of an ideology of black supremacy in order to
confound one of white supremacy. In its fabulous dramaturgy, he worked
out the basics of an Afrocentric aesthetics and historiography---the
sweeping interpretive claims he was just then inserting into the
scholarship on which the forthcoming books [The Negro]{.epub-i} and [The
Gift of Black Folk]{.epub-i} were based. Clearly anticipating the
message of his pageant in [The Crisis,]{.epub-i} Du Bois wrote that the
Negro ""is essentially dramatic. His greatest gift to the world has been
and will be the gift of art, of appreciation and realization of
beauty.""[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-55){#cha-55} If European
philosophers from Hegel to de Gobineau (and soon the American
sociologist Robert Park) had been saying much the same things for a
century, in [The Star of Ethiopia]{.epub-i} Du Bois presented those
attributes as the source of mankinds greatest achievements.

The 242-page book [The Negro,]{.epub-i} published simultaneously in the
United States and Great Britain in May 1915, was stippled with similar
double-edged generalizations, broad characterizations of African peoples
that would have been seen as invidious if propounded by a European
scholar. In what was the first general history yet written in English on
the subject, Du Bois casually informed readers that ""in disposition the
Negro is among the most lovable of men,"" that there could be ""no doubt
of the Negro's deep and delicate sense of beauty in form, color, and
sound,"" or that Haiti's peasantry is ""the happiest and most contented
peasantry in the
world.""[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-56){#cha-56} Yet, as the
editor of the popular Home University Library series and Alfred Harcourt
at Henry Holt and Company immediately recognized, Du Bois's original
75,000-word manuscript was a pioneering synthesis of the latest
scholarship brilliantly beamed through a revisionist lens. The author
ranged from the dawn of civilization to the turn of the twentieth
century and over three continents. [The Negro]{.epub-i} was a large
building block in an Afrocentric historiography that has achieved
credibility through the writings of scholars such as Basil Davidson,
Martin Bernal, and Cheikh Anta Diop. Although several mainstream reviews
were conventionally racist (such as one by a future associate editor of
[The Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences]{.epub-i}), most praised Du Bois's
sixth book as a major contribution, although many barely concealed their
inadequate grasp of the
subject.[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-57){#cha-57}

Greatly indebted to Boas, von Luschan, Alexander F. Chamberlain, Robert
H. Lowie, Jacques Loeb, and other social and physical scientists (all
extensively quoted), the pages of [The Negro]{.epub-i} were littered
with the fallacious concepts exploded by Du Bois---estimates of black
African technological backwardness in the Neolithic Age, Aryan and
Hamitic foundations of ancient civilizations, color-based presumptions
of inferiority prior to the Industrial Revolution in northern Europe,
absence of high culture and complex political structures in precolonial
Africa, and so on. Du Bois presented slavery in the American South as
integral to modern capitalism, but an institution that worked badly and
mirrored ""the modern factory system in its worst conceivable form."" His
interpretation of Reconstruction remained radically at variance with the
prevailing Dunning dogma. His prediction of Pan-African unity and the
global solidarity of darker peoples would have a deep impact upon
nonwhite elites in the United States, the Caribbean, and West Africa. ""A
belief in humanity means a belief in colored men,"" Du Bois proclaimed at
the close of [The Negro,]{.epub-i} much as the herald of his pageant
had. ""The future world will, in all reasonable probability, be what
colored men make it.""[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-58){#cha-58}

Near the end of October 1915, Nina received a typed, single-spaced,
three-page account of the pageant's reception in the capital. ""The
people of Washington were very good indeed, but skeptical,"" Du Bois
said; ""they just could not believe that the thing could be done,
especially in so short a time."" Nina had worried about the unpunctual
Charles Burroughs, the drama director (one of Will's Wilberforce
students), but Will wrote that Burroughs, though late as usual, had done
""splendid work."" The wet weather had held off almost miraculously. The
only mishap had had to do with Will's own injudiciousness on the night
before the opening. Despite nagging stomach trouble, he had gone with
Dill and a few others to a party and eaten crab salad and ice cream. ""It
nearly knocked out the pageant although the public did not know
it.""[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-59){#cha-59} He closed with a
query about the Zeppelins. Maybe Nina would prefer living in a smaller
town. But, on second thought, he supposed a new town ""would be lonesome
after your many acquaintances."" The next news Nina had from him would be
about his trip to Florida and Georgia in February 1916. In Atlanta he
had seen Miss Pingree (""and talked and talked and talked""), Proctor, and
the Hopes, and had spoken in both the Morehouse (the new name for
Atlanta Baptist) College and Atlanta University chapels. There had been
some sharp exchanges with Ware and the trustees in 1912 about
transferring the Atlanta University Studies to New York and Du Bois
would make a final grab for them through the Slater Fund that November.
After publication of the excellent [Negro American Artisan]{.epub-i} in
1912, Du Bois had pulled Dill away in September of the following year to
become business manager of [The Crisis.]{.epub-i} The last of the
conference reports, [Morals and Manners among Negro Americans,]{.epub-i}
appeared in 1914.[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-60){#cha-60}

Whatever the tensions caused by the Atlanta Studies issue, all was
conviviality during Du Bois's visit, with ""everybody ask\[ing\] about
you and Yolande,"" and a Saturday evening lecture and faculty reception.
After his lecture, Will wrote that he went over to the Townses with some
of the teachers and danced until midnight. From Atlanta, he sped to
Boston to attend the Spingarn Medal ceremony in honor of Charles Young,
who gave an excellent address. He, Young, and twenty others returned
together to New York for a dinner to send Young off to command his
cavalry regiment in the punitive expedition against Pancho
Villa.[[61]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-61){#cha-61} While in
Atlanta, though, Du Bois had seen a woman with whom both he and Nina had
been friendly. As people remember her, she was not beautiful in any
conventional sense, but Louie Davis Shivery was a handsome woman with
panache. She was college-trained, exceedingly intelligent, taught
English in the segregated public school system, and was given to wearing
outlandish clothes. She and her dentist husband, George, lived in
discord in a tidy corner house on Chestnut, a narrow street at the foot
of the Atlanta University campus. Dr. Shivery was a brute whose
mistreatment of his wife was common knowledge in the neighborhood. There
were many nights when the daughter of one faculty family on Chestnut
Street overheard her parents consoling the tormented wife. George
Shivery's demands, it seems, ""were more than she could tolerate,""
Josephine Harreld Love says, ""so it wasn't, you know, exactly an idyllic
marriage."" That was exactly what Will had written Nina that
February---that Louie Shivery ""has a hard time. Her husband gets drunk
and beats her now and then for
exercise.""[[62]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-62){#cha-62} Will's
concern for Louie Shivery's welfare, which led to their much-gossiped
about relationship of many years, may well have crossed the line
dividing compassion from adultery at this time.

Nina's knowledge of Will's various affairs is elusive. She would have
had to have been deliberately undiscerning not to have had any
suspicions, because by then Will had carried on more than a few such
relationships. Mildred Bryant's name would have meant nothing to her
then. Will must have met this mischievous, fast-talking piano teacher in
Louisville, Kentucky, on an NAACP speaking circuit during 1913 or 1914.
""Another favor to ask (don't you feel like shaking me and calling me a
bother? Well, please put such thoughts away!),"" Bryant chirped in a
March 1916 letter about a public school position in Washington,
D.C.[[63]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-63){#cha-63} Although he sent
a reference immediately, Bryant would soon move on to Chicago, where the
frayed little places that she rented or later owned on the South Side
would warm a visiting Du Bois on many nights over the next thirty-odd
years. But Nina would have known Jessie Fauset well. The
Philadelphia-born Cornell graduate was the epitome of what shallow folk
regarded as the highest Talented Tenth virtues---cosmopolitan, comely,
and cafÃ© au lait. Her effusive 1903 letter about [The Souls of Black
Folk]{.epub-i} had led to her becoming Du Bois's protÃ©gÃ©e, then
collaborator, and soon lover. Fauset had taught since 1906 at
Washington's academically demanding M Street (later Dunbar) High School.

Her ambition, which Du Bois sincerely encouraged, was to write the Great
African-American Novel, something she called ""There Is Confusion"" even
then. In March 1912, she had begun writing the ""What to Read"" section in
[The Crisis.]{.epub-i} In December and January, the
twenty-seven-year-old French teacher had almost seemed to monopolize the
magazine with ""Emmy,"" a fat, serialized, illustrated story about
prejudice, ""passing"" for white, and star-crossed romance. An opportunity
to write, while pursuing advanced work in French, came in June 1914 with
a fellowship to study in Paris. Du Bois sent a tureen of steamed
lobsters to the S. S. [Cedric]{.epub-i} as it weighed anchor from New
York, with a note in his nearly illegible left-handed script. When Du
Bois wanted to, Fauset gushed aboard ship, he could be ""so unspeakably
kind and nice."" She had delayed opening fifteen other letters (some from
relatives) and two telegrams in order to read his first, ""and reread it
and tucked it under my pillow my one sea-sickish night and thought
literally 'on' it many
times.""[[64]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-64){#cha-64}

Whatever her qualms about Will's relationships, Nina's pressing concern
remained Yolande, whose roller-coaster performance at Bedales had
finally stuck fast by spring of 1916. Headmaster Badley gravely informed
the Du Boises in early April of his sad conclusion that ""either the girl
is not by temperament and natural bent able to respond to the influences
around her here, or that we have quite failed to find the means of
reaching what may be yet undeveloped in her."" It was time to come home,
Nina announced in a letter barely concealing her relief. ""I think we
better, taking all things into consideration."" They would sail on the
[St. Louis]{.epub-i} on August 5, she said. Yolande's reaction was
unexpected and traumatic. It was her father who had forced her into this
alien environment and had caused her to disgrace herself, even though
she had done her best. Subconsciously, she must have wanted to blame
him; but since W. E. Burghardt Du Bois was infallible, she could not
bring herself to dare it; instead, she let her anger and impertinence
overflow, arguing that she had the right to try to do better and make
him proud of her. She collected her classmates' signatures on a letter
that amounted to a petition. Molly Scott was so upset that she wrote
directly to ""Dear Dr. Du Bois,"" pleading on Yolande's behalf for another
year, She'd rather do ""[anything]{.epub-i} in all the world than leave
Bedales,"" Yolande insisted. ""I know I've worked hard at lessons this
term and I can't do more and I can't help it if I'm stupid."" Why had he
made her come there if she had to leave now ""just when I am a senior and
getting to \[be\] old enough to be something like a
vice-boss...?""[[65]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-65){#cha-65}

Nina and Yolande sailed into New York harbor in mid-August of 1916. Will
met them and escorted them to Sea Isle City, New Jersey, where he
settled them into Ocean House. Then he left for his summer vacation in
Maine.[[66]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter16-66){#cha-66}

B[ERKSHIRE]{.epub-sc} P[RODIGY]{.epub-sc}

""S[O WITH]{.epub-sc} some circumstance,"" Du Bois trumpeted in
[Darkwater,]{.epub-i} ""having finally gotten myself born, with a flood
of Negro blood, a strain of French, a bit of Dutch, but, thank God! no
'Anglo-Saxon,' I come to the days of my childhood."" The house where he
was born was one of two on Church Street belonging to Thomas Jefferson
McKinley, an enterprising ex-slave who worked as a coachman for the
Humphrey family, sold vegetables, and quietly accumulated considerable
real estate. ""Old Jeff,"" as the townspeople called him, had come north
out of Louisiana about 1863, after being sold ""down the Mississippi"" by
his North Carolina master. Later, he escaped and served in some menial
capacity with the Southern Berkshire Company of the 49th Massachusetts
Infantry Regiment at Port Hudson, Louisiana. Alfred and Mary lived next
door to McKinley, on the north side of Church Street, just a few yards
from the Housatonic, at what is today number 51. Both houses were torn
down about 1900, and M. T. Cavanaugh's plumbing supply roughly marks the
spot today, ninety years later. The house was, as Willie described it,
sturdy, neat, large enough, with fair-sized front and back yards, and
convenient to Main Street. Their lives together should have been off to
a good start.[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-1){#cha-1}

The collapse of Mary Silvina's marriage came quickly. Before the baby
was two years old, she had had to give up the house by the Housatonic
and leave him with Othello and Sarah in their house on the South
Egremont road. Willie always believed that the ""black Burghardts"" had
made Alfred feel so unwelcome that he took his barber's tools elsewhere,
fully expecting that Mary Silvina and the new baby would shortly follow.
Not only were the black Burghardts seen as clannish rustics, deeply
hostile to all that was different or new, Du Bois almost bitterly
accuses his mother's people of color prejudice. These ""black Burghardts
didn't like it \[marriage to Alfred\], because he was too white,"" he
insisted, ""and he had a lot of extra manners which they weren't used
to.... At any rate, they practically drove him away."" When a historian
from Columbia University's Oral History Project delicately probed the
subject the year before Du Bois left for Ghana, reproach gave way to raw
indictment, exposing the festering wound inflicted by a father's absence
upon a still-tortured son. To the interviewer's question about whether
his father ""didn't just run away,"" Du Bois's agitated denial was,
""NoÂ ... I know, from testimony from other parts of the family, that they
made it just as uncomfortable for Alfred as they could."" Then,
reflecting upon the doleful implications of in-group color prejudice, Du
Bois added, ""I don't suppose it was simply a matter of color. It was a
matter of culture."" In the son's final ordering of blame, Alfred was
absolved because he ""came from a different
world.""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-2){#cha-2}

And yet, subconsciously, he must always have wondered. The family's
brooding conspiracy of silence about Alfred was deeply unsettling. He
watched as his mother ""sank into depression."" If Willie asked her very
little about Alfred because he knew ""instinctively that this was a
subject which hurt"" too much even to mention, how much of his reticence
also came from knowing instinctively that his father had caused much of
the pain? That he was not illegitimate like his older brother meant a
great deal to a sensitive boy born into the last generation of
Victorians and growing up in a typical New England
town.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-3){#cha-3} The stigma of
bastardy on top of poverty and blackness in a fishbowl community of
whites must have been an appalling threat to the Burghardts.
Star-crossed love with a first cousin was supposed to repair Mary
Silvina's transgression, although the extent to which the fiction was
actually believed is doubtful. But the stigma of spousal desertion
remained. Willie would have needed to believe Mary Silvina when she told
him that Alfred had intended for them to follow him to Connecticut, and
that he had waited and hoped until his death. But as this, too, was a
fiction, undoubtedly it retained its hold over mother and son only to
the degree that it remained unexamined and accepted on faith. What boy
would choose to believe that his father had deserted him when the
romantic myth of the well-intentioned cavalier allowed the blame to be
shifted to jealous, rustic clansmen?

Reading these formative years through Willie's reconstructions of them
in mature life raises doubts about how much is a faithful record of his
mother's thoughts and how much is his own elaboration. Adelbert's
version is certainly very different. According to Willie, his older
brother was ""silent""---a cipher, evanescent, and conveniently
unavailable. His virtual absence from Willie's autobiographies---aside
from two or three sentences---makes us neglect to probe the nature of
their relationship. Adelbert must have had to care for his little
brother when they lived on Egremont Plain. Five years older than his
sibling, he might have instructed Willie in his first game of marbles or
put a healing gob of spittle on a small cut. Willie, of course, had no
memory of that strangely confused night when some of his Burghardt
cousins---the Jackson boys, George, Henry, and Samuel---fired pistols
from the riverbank near the Church Street house, throwing Alfred into
frenzied packing and a precipitous exit from Great Barrington. Although
Adelbert said long afterward that what was merely a rustic prank had
been mistaken for a deadly plot---""for some reason \[he\] thought they
were after him""---Alfred certainly had reason to think he was escaping
from angry Burghardts who had found out about the Albany Hannah or some
other indecent chapter in his life. Apparently, Adelbert never told
Willie about the details of this night until long after they reached
adulthood. And there was more he could have told. Seventy-seven years
later, living on public welfare in Brooklyn, he sent word to his now
famous brother that he wanted to share information about the family. The
gigantic collection of Du Bois papers is silent about the response, if
any, Adelbert received.[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-4){#cha-4}
Were there things about his family (especially his father) Willie sensed
early on that it was better not to know for the sake of the family past
he preferred to invent? In any case, Alfred Du Bois appears to have shot
out of Mary's and Willie's lives like a rocket.

Othello---""Uncle Tello""---died when Willie was only five, and family
fortunes went steadily downward from then on. In [Darkwater,]{.epub-i}
the most passionate but least candid of his autobiographical writings,
Du Bois says of these times, nevertheless, ""They were very happy.""
Almost a score of years afterward, he still insisted his childhood had
been idyllic. He could ""remember no poverty, although our family was
certainly poor."" The town and its surroundings ""were a boy's
paradise.... My family were pleasant and miscellaneous."" Yet Sarah was
forced to sell the property on Egremont Plain immediately in settlement
of debts, moving with Mary Silvina and her two grandsons into central
Great Barrington, where Inez, the daughter of Mary Silvina's brother,
James, probably continued to live with them. For a time, they lived
above the Sumner estate stables south of Main Street, which Willie
remembered as affording ""infinite pleasure"" because of the wide yard and
the lane leading to the public school grounds. As needy as Sarah and
Mary must have been for lodging and domestic work, Willie suggests that
""this nearness to school induced mother to choose this
home.""[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-5){#cha-5} Adelbert's half
brother fails to say whether Mary Silvina was also concerned about her
older son's education. Presumably, Adelbert was already working as a
waiter to help the family.

Willie says that the home above the stables gave way, with Sarah's death
in about 1875, to a sojourn in Railroad Street. Living there would have
undermined the emotional resiliency of most boys of average abilities.
Willie, who was anything but average, lost no time in learning how to
survive the unacceptable fate of the Railroad Street years. It was a
feat of sublimation, willpower, and brains. Railroad intersects Main at
its midpoint, then runs west up a mild gradient where several buildings
in its path force a sharp L turn, after which it follows for a short,
parallel distance what were, in Willie's day, the old Housatonic
Railroad tracks. To local Comstocks, Railroad Street was two blocks of
perdition, a foul causeway of ruin through three or four saloons,
gambling dens, and at least one house of prostitution. A miasma of
tobacco and reek of alcohol saturated the narrow street, as mill
workers, day laborers, and more than a few less-respectable old settlers
stumbled into and out of it. The indelible social taint of the street
was such that, long after George Briggs invested his saloon profits in a
respectable and successful business, Willie said the townspeople ""never
forgot his former calling."" Mary Silvina rented a dilapidated house at
the top of Railroad Street, hard by the tracks. They shared it with a
white family, the Millers, even more destitute than themselves. Mrs.
Miller was nearly insane.[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-6){#cha-6}

In his Columbia oral-history transcript, Willie remembers having liked
the Railroad Street house because he ""could see the engines."" But even
then, at ninety-two, this must surely have been reflexive bravura about
a milieu circumscribed by immiseration, dementia, and deformity. Mary
Silvina's nerves tell us the truth about the family's fall from grace,
even if, humanly enough, her son never quite could. A paralytic stroke,
suffered soon after renting the soot-covered house by the tracks,
impaired her left leg or arm, or both. James, her barbering brother, and
her sisters ""always stood by,"" and many of the townspeople gave them
necessities and found light chores that Mary Silvina could do without
taxing herself.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-7){#cha-7} Adelbert
sent small sums from odd jobs in Albany. Willie pitched in, finding work
after school. Most school days, he headed down Main after four to meet
his mother, taking whatever bundles she was carting home and offering a
supporting shoulder as they hobbled into Railroad Street. They were a
regular feature of town life, occasioning well-intentioned remarks about
their mutual devotion. Willie was always ""a little surprised because
people said how nice I was to my mother."" ""I just grew up that way. We
were companions,"" said he, pure and
simple.[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-8){#cha-8}

The companionship of cellmates is a harsh image, and yet it would be
serviceably close to the truth. By nature laconic, Mary Silvina said
almost nothing these days, shutting up memories of improvident loves and
spoiled womanhood inside herself. She had responded with a venturesome
woman's love to Alfred's trompe-l'oeil world of breeding and enterprise.
There in Railroad Street---almost the end of the line for
her---disabled, and further disabled by education, class, gender, and
race, Mary Silvina invested what was left of herself in Willie. Her
specific do's and don'ts were few, he said: with the ravages at their
doorstep as a constant reminder, Willie must never touch liquor (which
he didn't until student days in Germany); loose women and games of
chance for money were never to be indulged; and she forbade smoking (a
command he violated ""a little bit, but not very much""). Otherwise, Mary
Silvina followed a policy of noninterference in Willie's conduct. Unlike
many parents of her generation, she made no attempt to train him out of
left-handedness. But though taciturn, she had a way of making her
displeasure unmistakable, and when that happened, if Willie ""got the
idea that anything that I did displeased her, then I just didn't do it,
that's all.""[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-9){#cha-9} What gave
Mary Silvina the greatest of all pleasures was her younger son's
performance in school. It was not only a means by which a dutiful son
could please his mother; Willie gradually saw that academic achievement
was his ticket out of Railroad Street.

Even before his scholastic abilities became apparent, he sensed that he
was something of a curiosity to the white townspeople because of his
light color and the long locks that changed to a crinkly texture by the
time he was four; and he was well aware of their interest by the time he
entered public elementary school. But if his being physically different
""riveted attention"" upon him, he was fortunate in long being able to
ignore Great Barrington's muted racism (even when he dimly recognized
it). First came an awareness of class distinctions. A restraint of
displayed affluence muted Great Barrington's income disparities, making
the lot of the deprived socially less onerous. The mill-owning Russell
family's unostentatious frame house was distinguished from that of
Johnny Morgan's storeowning parents by quantity of Victorian plush in
furnishings, rather than by dramatic differences of scale and inventory.
Gradually, Willie realized nonetheless that ""most of the colored
personsÂ ... including my own folk, were poorer than the well-to-do
whites."" If he couldn't say exactly why this was so while he was growing
up (""There was no real discrimination on account of color""), he could
see that the mudsill Irish served, like black people in the contemporary
South, to deflect stigma from others who would have shared a place at
the bottom. ""I cordially despised the poor Irish and South Germans,"" he
confessed, adding that ""none of the colored folk I knew were so poor,
drunken and sloven.""[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-10){#cha-10}

However poor, drunken, and sloven, the Irish and Bavarians and Czechs
were as white as their Anglo-Saxon detractors, a trump card that Willie
and his people could never find in the deck of assimilation.
[Darkwater]{.epub-i} would insist that his adolescence was spent
securely among white mates, that he ""annexed the rich and well-to-do"" as
his natural companions, and was ""very much one of them,"" even at ""the
center and sometimes the leader of the town gang of boys."" Not when they
played the new game of baseball, however; he confessed to being not very
good at it. Never once, interestingly, does Willie mention that he was
shorter and skinnier than most of his peers. Yet, much as he felt he
""belonged"" and disdained the foul-mouthed, rock-throwing immigrant
youngsters who ridiculed his proper airs and sometimes called him
""nigger,"" Willie's troubling sense that he was somehow different grew,
at first imperceptibly, then gnawingly. Puberty and high school brought
the feeling to a
climax.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-11){#cha-11}

One, perhaps two, African-American teenagers had taken a year or more of
high school, but no Burghardt had ever gone beyond an elementary
education. They saw no need of it, says Willie. Mary Silvina did. ""My
mother rather insisted on it,"" Willie recalled. By now, at age twelve,
he ""began to recognize that in some way, for some reason---I wasn't
clear at all about it---I sort of had to justify myself."" Part of the
reason must have been Mary Silvina. Her boy had the stamina of the best
of her people and the quickness of the Du Boises, and it would have been
in her nature to do all that she could to save him from an obscure
existence as one more upstanding, prosaic Great Barrington Burghardt.
She must have resigned herself to her son's success coming too late to
improve her lot: Mary Silvina would already be in her late fifties when
Willie reached manhood---aged in the enervated way of working-class
females, her once-sturdy frame crippled and crumbling. But Willie
deserved the chance to make a place for himself beyond the Berkshires;
and his success would be her redemption.

But first they had to escape Railroad Street. Fortunately, some of the
town's prominent citizens had begun to take more than passing interest
in the family (""a sort of overseeing custody,"" Willie wrote
later)---especially in
Willie.[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-12){#cha-12} In an act of
supreme commitment to his future, silent Mary Silvina led them out of
Railroad Street to a prim, small house behind the property of the Cass
family back in Church Street, just a few diagonal paces from the rear of
the First Congregational Church on Main and within sight of the
Housatonic. Willie tells us that the river was golden-colored because of
pollution from the paper mill upstream. Mary Silvina's brother, the
barber James, boarded with them, which helped. The house Dr. Cass rented
to them was without plumbing or electricity, like most of the houses of
the period, but it had two rooms and a pantry on the ground floor and
two bedrooms above. Willie now had his own room, a ""luxury \[he\] never
dreamed was so rare,"" an admission bourgeois enough to be excised,
eighty-one years later, from the Russian-language edition of his
[Autobiography.]{.epub-i}[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-13){#cha-13}
From the neat house with its breathing space and relative quiet, he
walked every day up to Main Street to the brick school building facing
the town hall.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[FOUR YEARS]{.epub-sc} of hard, resourceful, stellar labors rolled by
while he and his mother lived in the Cass home. Willie mowed lawns,
distributed tea from the new A&P chain, tossed the hefty [Springfield
Republican]{.epub-i} onto front porches, chopped wood on weekends for
the spinster Smith sisters, stoked Madame L'Hommedieu's millinery shop
stove every morning for twenty-five cents a week, and fetched free milk
from old Mr. Taylor's cows on lower Main. Charles Taylor, who died soon
after volume one of his [History of Great Barrington]{.epub-i} was
published in 1883, ""impressed \[Willie\] greatly."" Very likely, the old
scholar talked shop with the young scholar; but the fact that
African-Americans are invisible in Taylor's rich chronicle tells us much
about the times, the milieu, and the races. Willie was certainly not
invisible, though, as he scurried from home to school to chores and
back. As the hard slog to survive ground down his mother and the other
Burghardts, it had the reverse effect on him. While Mary Silvina
persevered, limping and sighing, and Uncle Jim came home from Railroad
Street ""walking very straight because of liquor,"" and the Casses learned
not always to expect the monthly rent, Willie developed a compensating
sense of adolescent self that would become more portentous and embracing
in the coming years. ""I very early got the idea,"" he told the
interviewer from Columbia, ""that what I was going to do was to prove to
the world that Negroes were just like other
people.""[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-14){#cha-14}

He had told himself that race, in the large sense of generalized and
dismissive attitudes about his people, had played no part in his
elementary school experience. Had he not become the ""favorite"" of ""stern
and inflexible"" Miss Cross, his first primary teacher? Had he not been
cheered on by the leading citizens as he advanced year after year---the
sole black boy in the school---more quickly than most of his white
classmates? Had he not always felt welcome in the homes of even his
wealthy classmates and frequently been complimented by their parents for
setting a good example? In the early, innocent, Horatio Alger years,
then, Willie believed that the differences between people were the
result of industry or ability---and sometimes physical courage.
""Trounced"" once by a burly white lad during recess, ""honor"" had been
preserved by fighting and suffering manfully before onlooking
classmates.[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-15){#cha-15} The shanty
Irish ""preferred"" to live as they did, he concluded, just as most of the
black Burghardts now lacked the acumen to keep up. Mike Gibbons was
better at marbles than he, but Mike was a dummy at Latin. Art Benham
drew awfully good pictures but was a slouch when it came to putting his
feelings into words. Secure in his playground sociology, in which class
and race had more to do with character than with economics, Willie had
acquired a rugged individualist's understanding of social mobility and
been greatly reassured until he reached his
teens.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-16){#cha-16}

With that flare for drama in language in which he has few equals, Willie
pinpoints, in [The Souls of Black Folk,]{.epub-i} the exact moment in
his ten-year-old life, a spring day in 1878, when the theorems of
playground sociology were, supposedly, forever shattered:

I remember well when the shadow swept across me. I was a little thing,
away up in the hills of New England, where the dark Housatonic winds
between Hoosac and Taghkanic to the sea. In a wee wooden school-house,
something put it into the boys' and girls' heads to buy gorgeous
visiting-cards---ten cents a package---and exchange. The exchange was
merry, till one girl, a tall newcomer, refused my card---refused it
peremptorily, with a glance. Then it dawned upon me with a certain
suddenness that I was different from the others; or like, mayhap, in
heart and life, and longing, but shut out from their world by a vast
veil.[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-17){#cha-17}

A permanent, anchoring sense of Du Bois's racial identity
[could]{.epub-i} have come from a single such traumatic rebuff in the
""wee wooden schoolhouse."" Interracial companionship has always been one
of the first casualties of approaching puberty. The incident must have
occurred, and his account of it is certainly psychologically plausible;
yet sympathetic skepticism is advisable whenever Du Bois advances a
concept or proposition by way of autobiography. Often, the truth is not
in the facts but in the conceptual or moral validity behind them. In the
case of the sweeping shadow and separating veil, there are several
versions and equivalents.

In one, the lacerating moment is replaced by a Chinese water torture of
small and subtle insults. ""Very gradually---I cannot now distinguish the
steps,"" [Darkwater,]{.epub-i} angriest of the memoirs, says, ""though
here and there I remember a jump or a jolt---but very gradually I found
myself assuming quite placidly"" that race mattered greatly. And how is
the placid recognition of racism on one page of [Darkwater]{.epub-i} to
be squared with the unambiguous racial assault on his ego when local
girls spurn him?---""Then I flamed! I lifted my chin and strode off to
the mountains, where I viewed the world at my feet and strained my eyes
across the shadow of the hills."" Another account seems to place the
conversion experience of the cards in the brick high school, and the
offending newcomer may have been Agnes O'Neil, whom Willie dismisses in
the [Autobiography]{.epub-i} as a gorgeous dresser ""whose ancestors
nobody knewÂ ... otherwise she was negligible."" In this version, it was
then that he ""began to feel the pressure of the 'veil of color'; in
little matters at first and then in larger,"" after entering high
school.[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-18){#cha-18}

Whatever the personal dynamics of racial self-discovery were, by his
thirteenth birthday Willie came to have an informed idea of what being a
black male meant even in the relatively tolerant New England. ""There
were some days of secret tears."" He became painfully aware of the local
whites who ""actually consideredÂ ... brown skin a misfortune""; some ""even
thought it a crime."" One of them, a Church Street neighbor, nearly sent
him to the large reform school in eastern Massachusetts for stealing
grapes from the yard of a wealthy citizen. Judge Justin Dewey, Jr., of
the county court, who huffed out of the Congregational Church into the
Episcopal over a matter involving communion wine cups, was of the
opinion that a smart, poor, spirited black boy would be much improved
learning a trade under lock and key. After considerable hubbub and firm
opposition from the high school principal, Frank Hosmer, the judge
settled for a crotchety admonition. It was the close call historically
awaiting all black males in American society, putting Willie on notice
of his fragility and isolation, and driving him much closer to despair
than his game, euphuistic prose ever revealed. There were many times
when he soared above Great Barrington in order to keep ""them"" from
deflating his spirits, pitying his ""pale companions"" and telling himself
that he ""felt not so much disowned and rejected as rather drawn up into
higher spaces and made part of a mightier
mission.""[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-19){#cha-19}

Frank Alvin Hosmer had more than an inkling of the social and emotional
gamut Willie Du Bois had to run, and he did his best to guide him
through it, but without obvious favoritism or condescension. Hosmer's
was an old, moderately distinguished New England family with strong
Congregational ties. Service, uplift, and reform were bred deep in it.
After graduating from Amherst, he came to Great Barrington to teach,
becoming principal of the public high school---""G.B.H.S.""---in the late
1870s. In 1890, he took over the editorship of the [Berkshire
Courier]{.epub-i} but answered the call to Hawaii after a year to take
the presidency of the missionary college at Oahu. When the American
sugar planters and missionaries overthrew Queen Liliuokalani two years
later, electing Sanford Ballard Dole, another Bay State
Congregationalist, to the presidency of the Provisional Government of
Hawaii, Frank Hosmer served on the Advisory Council. About 1900, he came
back to the mainland, successfully ran for the Massachusetts
legislature, and, always ready to serve, died, according to [The New
York Times,]{.epub-i} ""from overwork in \[the\] Red Cross"" in May 1918.
Yankee families like Hosmer's had manned the battalions of American
Missionary Association (AMA) teachers and Freedmen's Bureau personnel
fanning out over the defeated South to take charge of the
ex-slaves---what one historian has aptly called ""soldiers of light and
love,"" who, with limited understanding of their wards and less sense of
humor, set out to inculcate an austere gospel, a stern work ethic, and
an enabling literacy.[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-20){#cha-20}

By the time Willie entered high school, the end of the military
occupation of the South---Reconstruction---was just four years old,
bringing with it, in the infamous Compromise of 1877, the inevitable
dismantling of what most white people in the former Confederacy
furiously denounced as the alien political and social experiment in
black empowerment. For better or worse, Yankee stewardship of the
republic's newest citizens was in its final phase. Formal
disfranchisement, in naked violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, had not
yet come about, nor had institutionalized ""Jim Crow""---banning of black
people from commercial establishments and public places and herding them
into the last seats and rickety add-ons in trains and streetcars. That
would begin in earnest a decade later, with the revision of
Mississippi's constitution. In the 1880s, however, it was still possible
for northern ""friends"" to believe that there would be room in the
""redeemed"" South for ""wise"" and ""patient"" exercise of civil rights,
provided African-Americans found intelligent, upright leaders of their
own race. Principal Hosmer believed in the prospect of fair-minded race
relations in the South, and, as was true of many other leading
Congregationalists, he was always on the lookout for African-American
leadership talent. Without knowing it at the time, Willie began his
audition with Hosmer before the end of the first year.

Later, he would understand just how fortuitous Hosmer's influence upon
his life had been. In 1880s America, not even the sons of millowners
(and no daughters) took college education as a matter of course. Willie
recalled that maybe two others in his graduating class of thirteen were
heading for college. He knew well that the doors to higher education
were ""barred with ancient tongues"" and that his best hope for steady
work in the future, paying enough to support himself and his ailing
mother, was by way of vocational courses offered at Great Barrington
High. Willie's supercharged ambition at first failed to grasp the value
a college education might have for a colored man. That realization came
from Hosmer: ""He suggested, quite as a matter of fact, that I ought to
take the college preparatory
course.""[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-21){#cha-21} There was no
way Mary Silvina's weekend work at farmer Beckwith's, Uncle Jim's
barbering, the unraveling Burghardt clan's fitful help, and all Willie's
odd jobs could afford the college-course textbooks on Greek, Latin,
algebra, and geometry. Hosmer spoke to Louis Russell's mother, second
wife of Farley Russell the millowner, who agreed to buy them. Louis
Russell was a frail, friendly boy, not too bright, who attended the
town's private secondary school, the exclusive Sedgwick Institute now
run by the Van Lennups. Willie helped him with his lessons, and,
perhaps, as Mrs. Russell had hoped, became one of the awkward boy's
closest companions. Charles Church, independent-minded heir to the
paper-mill fortune and another Van Lennup student, hobnobbed with them.
These were friendships that support Will's insistence that he ""was
thrown with the upper rather than the lower social classes and protected
in many ways.""[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-22){#cha-22}

The picture of a mischievous Willie, assigned to a front seat in Miss
Ida Roraback's class in order to be watched, rings false, even though
schoolmate Mary Crissey's recollections have to be taken seriously. Mary
was a good student, but nearly ninety years had elapsed when reporter
John La Fontana of the [Berkshire Courier]{.epub-i} asked her what she
remembered about Du Bois. The single surviving mention of him in the
school records notes a perfect attendance record. Then there is Willie's
distress over the lackluster scholastic performance of the only other
black student to attend GBHS (who ""did not excel the whites as I was
used to doing"" and washed out quickly). He was probably too competitive
for prankishness, too ""grimly determined to make them sweat for it!""
whenever any of his white mates topped him in academics. Still, he was
sociable enough. Mary Crissey and Sabra Taylor liked him, and since
there were no dances at GBHS to trouble the racially squeamish, Willie
felt he could be friendly without fear of
complications.[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-23){#cha-23} Fat Ned
Kelly, future town clerk, and unsmart George Beebee, GBHS's best
dresser, were boon companions to go skinny-dipping with in Green River
or for hiking up into the Mountains of the Moon. George and Willie were
closer, opposites attracted to one another, with Willie, wearing
hand-me-down clothes tenderly restitched by Mary Silvina, helping
handsome, natty George with his studies. George Beebee became a
prosperous physician. Willie and Mary Dewey, the hanging judge's
daughter, seem to have been on amicable terms, even though she ran rings
around him in math.[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-24){#cha-24}

Today's educators would find the learning environment at GBHS rigid and
limited, with no-nonsense Ida Roraback and the school's other female
teacher beating time with their pointers to Latin declensions and rote
declamations from Underwood's [Primer of English Literature]{.epub-i}
and Greenleaf's [Algebra,]{.epub-i} while Frank Hosmer presided over the
complexities of Xenophon's [Anabasis,]{.epub-i} Virgil's
[Georgics,]{.epub-i} and William Jevons's [Theory of Political
Economy]{.epub-i} in the higher grades. But Hosmer was progressive for
his day, with a vision of Great Barrington's own sons and daughters
enriching cultural life through such newfangled activities as plays at
the town hall and a school paper. Sir Walter Scott's [Lady of the
Lake]{.epub-i} (without Willie) and [Old John Brown Had a Little
Indian]{.epub-i} (with Willie) were hits, filling Main Street with the
buckboards of farming families come to town hungry for entertainment.
Willie and a red-haired classmate, Art Benham, as gifted and
unattractive as George Beebee was slow and handsome, coedited the school
newspaper, [The Howler,]{.epub-i} during its very short life. Hosmer
even suggested the adoption of a snappy cap emblazoned with G.B.H.S.
(ridiculed, says Willie, as ""Great Big Hosmer Speculation"") to promote
esprit de corps and present a tonier face to the Sedgwick Institute
swells.[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-25){#cha-25}

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[AS FOR]{.epub-sc} Willie, Hosmer continued to influence his
intellectual growth. Some of those titles on Johnny Morgan's shelves, in
what passed for the town's bookstore, must have been suggested by
Hosmer. Thanks to Morgan, a chatty Welshman, Willie was welcome to read
cover to cover each weekend the new [Puck]{.epub-i} and [Judge]{.epub-i}
illustrateds before they were put on sale. But Willie was there every
day after school, as well, unobtrusively browsing in a corner the books
he had no money to buy. One fall day---it was early in his sophomore
year---he saw a deluxe edition of Macaulay's five-volume [History of
England.]{.epub-i} He ""wanted it fiercely."" Fondness for this nonpaying
customer had grown to the point where Morgan made what was then a
radical proposal: purchase on the installment plan at twenty-five cents
a week---the weekly wage from Madame L'Hommedieu's. Willie accepted,
carting his five volumes proudly off to Church Street just before
Christmas to devour them.

This supremely smug Whig history of the British Isles had sold more than
one hundred thousand copies before its author's death in 1859 stopped
the series at volume five. For Thomas Babington Macaulay, civilization
(by definition, Anglo-Saxon) was like a precisely engineered clock whose
mainspring, the Parliament at Westminster, had (ever since the rout of
monarchical privilege in the Glorious Revolution of 1688) kept the works
ticking over as perfectly as the Newtonian God did the cosmos. A few
historians already deplored Macaulay's Eminent Victorian
narrowmindedness, as well as his sociopolitical point of view, which
was, said the biographer Lytton Strachey, ""distinct enough, butÂ ...
without distinction."" Fourteen-year-old Willie was unaware of such
cutting-edge criticisms, of course; but in his enthusiasm for Macaulay's
matchless narrative powers---of such metered verisimilitude that
Macaulay's Seige of Derry and Battle of Killiecrankie were recited from
memory in cultured parlors on both sides of the Atlantic---he found
common ground even with the detractors (""no one has ever surpassed
Macaulay,"" the caustic Strachey conceded). Hosmer and Johnny Morgan had
introduced their young protÃ©gÃ© to a style of writing perhaps best
characterized as Westminster Abbey vivid---whose phrases, spliced by
commas, would swell in his inner ear decades after
GBHS.[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-26){#cha-26}

Fortunately for his readers, Macaulay's influence is altogether absent
from Willie's regular notices in the New York [Globe]{.epub-i} during
this time. Willie had been the Great Barrington distributor of the
weekly for more than a year before his first piece appeared in April
1883. Founded in 1881 by Timothy Thomas Fortune, a Byronically handsome
African-American who once seemed destined to inherit the mantle of the
great Frederick Douglass, the immensely popular [Globe]{.epub-i} spoke
for the forward-looking members of the
race.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-27){#cha-27} Fortune hailed
originally from Jacksonville, Florida, where his father, Emmanuel, had
served in the Reconstruction legislature and battled the Klan. Fortune
was named after his Irish grandfather, and, as if to prove an era's
stereotype, his meteoric career as author, journalist, and founder of
protest organizations was to be brawling, hard-drinking, and, in the
end, a tragedy of brilliance and courage misspent. He was one of the
first African-American men outside his own family whom Willie Du Bois
admired.[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-28){#cha-28} No paper trace
of his thoughts survives, but Willie must have hoped that writing might
open the door to a career, and T. Thomas Fortune was surely delighted to
find another free contributor.

Between April 10, 1883, and May 16, 1885, no less than twenty-four
articles and notices, signed ""W.E.D.,"" appeared in the [Globe]{.epub-i}
and the [Freeman,]{.epub-i} its successor. They are remarkably
revealing. First, they make it possible for us to realign the tilted
picture in the autobiographical writings of a somewhat uprooted,
mock-patrician, teenage Du Bois. Second, they catch for us the embryonic
distinct voice of the future prophet of African-American advancement and
protest. The [Autobiography]{.epub-i} was composed during the last full
decade of his life, when Willie was already well within the fold of the
American Communist Party, and yet, paradoxically, it contains the most
bourgeois treatment of the Great Barrington period. There, he writes of
having ""the social heritage not only of a New England clan but Dutch
taciturnity,"" and rather superciliously notes the existence of
""'contrabands,'"" those newcomers, ""a little uncouth"" but ""hardworkers
and so jolly,"" who ""astonished us by forming a little Negro Methodist
Zion Church, which we sometimes attended."" A similar superior tone is
heard in [Dusk of Dawn]{.epub-i} when, as he leaves Great Barrington for
the South, we hear that once or twice already he ""had had swift glimpses
of the colored world.""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-29){#cha-29}

He had had more than glimpses, and the AME Zion Church turns out not to
have been ""sometimes attended"" but a place of important and continual
social reference for him. He filed regular reports to the
[Globe]{.epub-i} and [Freeman]{.epub-i} detailing the church's busy
doings---the AME Zion Sewing Society's monthly supper at the home of Mr.
Jason Cooley (April 10); the well-attended quarterly-meeting services,
attracting worshippers from Lee and Stockbridge (May 29); the Sewing
Society's monthly supper and a debate (""Ought the Indian to Have Been
Driven Out of America?"") between Messrs. Crosby and Du Bois (June 26);
and, in the last report for 1883 (December 26), the startling news that
fifteen-year-old Willie is secretary of the Zion Sewing
Society.[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-30){#cha-30} For a
precocious teenage boy who found baseball uninteresting and relations
with girls of both races problematic, service as secretary of a sewing
circle must have had compensations. Whether or not those compensations
were ever sexual (introducing a brittle young male to forbidden delights
among sultry AME Zion wives and widows) is unknown, though unlikely. The
principal benefit may well have been in affording Willie the experience
of guiding an adult group's activities. That the group was mainly of
women may also have resonated in some deep recess of his sexual
identity---in that part of the male core where proclivities deemed to be
feminine by Victorian society reside. In any case, the Zion Sewing
Society was the first in a lifetime of similar activities in which
collaboration with women proved crucial to Willie's advancement.

Instead of the Sleepy Hollow peopled by taciturn Burghardts, Willie's
newspaper dispatches introduce us to a larger, livelier African-American
community, with himself in the midst of its joyous church services,
sewing circle, Sons of Freedom, and hayriding picnics to Lake Buell.
Rather quickly, also, his pieces in the New York weekly evolve from
straightforward reporting to uplifting commentary, occasionally just on
the cusp of scolding. ""The best thing that could be done for the colored
people"" would be the creation of a literary society, he advises,
regretting that ""there was not much interest manifested."" ""By the way,""
he interjects in the middle of one sewing circle piece, ""I did not
notice many colored men at the town meeting last month."" He notes the
local indifference to the forthcoming National Convention of Colored Men
in Louisville, Kentucky, to protest the 1883 Supreme Court decision
invalidating the Civil Rights Act of 1875. But he applauds recent
concern about the lack of ""business men among us."" A September 1883
piece---probably the lengthiest---has all the didactic urgency that
future readers of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} would come to expect. There had
been a humiliating reminder that year of black people's subordinate
position in New England civic life when two men of the town---one a
white Democrat, the other a black Republican---were finalists for the
position of nightwatchman. A committee of Republicans chose the
Democrat, an improbability that led Willie to summon the race to action:
""The colored men of Great Barrington hold the balance of power, and have
decided the election of many officers for a number of
years.""[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-31){#cha-31}

How Willie Du Bois actually began to see himself in these teen years,
rather than how he portrayed that consciousness of racial self years
later, assumed sharper contours during the summer before his last year
at GBHS. During July and early August 1883, he went to visit the
grandfather he had never seen, Alexander Du Bois, Alfred's elegant,
iron-willed father, now a retired merchant and ship's steward in New
Bedford, Massachusetts. Annie M. Freeman, Alexander's third wife,
persuaded the eighty-year-old patriarch that, before it was too late, an
inspection of Alfred's son was right and
proper.[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-32){#cha-32} Annie Freeman's
letter must have stimulated long dormant hopes in Mary Silvina.
Suddenly, there was a chance that Alexander Du Bois could give her son
some of the advantages she had believed possible through Alfred. Either
she scraped together the money or Alexander sent it, and Willie was off
on the Housatonic Railroad to Bridgeport for the first extended trip of
his life.

There were missed connections: first, the train to New Haven; then,
after exchanging tickets and going to Hartford, the early train to
Providence. There were memorable sights: the frescoed capitol building
at Hartford, where Willie entered his ""illustrious name"" into the
registry; beautiful coastal scenery, grand resorts, and steamships along
the Providence route. There was emotion and nostalgia: a Burghardt
relative doted on him in her ""nice little cottage"" in Providence. There
was entertainment: a grand picnic at Onset Point, followed by a Martha's
Vineyard outing to hear a famous female elocutionist. There was a new
navy blue suit, bought by an uncle in Amherst. All of it he recorded in
a wonderfully observant ""Dear Mam"" letter to Mary Silvina shortly after
reaching New Bedford. Telling her of the Hartford stopover, he wrote:

I looked into the chamber of the House of representatives. It is very
nice. The chairs & desk are arranged in a semicircle. The chairmans
\[sic\] seat is in the middle. In front are seats for the clerks & at
the side for reporters. There is an elevator which anybody can go up &
down in when they wish to. The whole building is frescoed splendidly. On
the outside there are niches for statues. There is a picture gallery in
the state library room. I cannot tell you Â½ what I saw there. I did not
go up in the dome fearing that the train would leave me. When I came
down to the depot & finding that I had a little time left I took a walk
up a street near by. When I got back to the depot the train was
[gone,]{.epub-i} & news agent told me there was no other to providence
train that afternoon. imagine my
situation\![[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-33){#cha-33}

Other things happened that impressionable summer. Heading home by way of
Providence again, Will was swept into the British Emancipation Day
festivities on August 1, mounted by the United Order of Odd Fellows at
Rocky Point on Narragansett Bay. ""Ten thousand Negroes of every hue and
bearing"" from three states came to celebrate the 1833 manumission by
Parliament of the slaves of the West Indies. Willie saw the ""whole
gorgeous gamut of the American Negro world; the swaggering men, the
beautiful girls, the laughter and gaiety, the unhampered
self-expression""---more people of color than he had ever imagined could
be found together in one spot. In [Dusk of Dawn]{.epub-i} and the
[Autobiography]{.epub-i} Willie remembered stopping in Albany with
Adelbert and seeing his first electric streetlights; but this was
actually an experience from a later
trip.[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-34){#cha-34} None of his
experiences that summer, however, quite matched Grandfather Alexander.

Meeting Grandfather Alexander was one of the turning points of Willie's
young life. ""Mad, very mad,"" because nobody met him at the depot, he
found his grandfather's home at 93 Acushnet Street about a half mile
off---a white house with green shutters and a ""yard full of flower
gardens \[sic\]."" ""Grandma,"" Alexander's wife, ""is about my color and
taller than I thought."" He found Alexander short, thickset, and erect.
""He says very little but speaks civily \[sic\]"" when spoken to, Willie
reported to Mary Silvina. Grandmother Annie maneuvered adroitly between
them, taking Willie on walks, presenting him to New Bedford's quality
""colored folk,"" and interpreting Alexander's cryptic moods. ""Grandma
says by and bye he'll talk more."" But grandfather never once mentioned
Alfred, as far as the available record reveals. He told his grandson
almost nothing of his own past (Annie, who had known Alfred, must have,
though), but Alexander's library, his silver plate, silk waistcoats, and
oenophile conceits filled the silences between them, leaving his
grandson with an evening's ineffaceable sense of the importance of
stately manners and breeding. With impressionable Willie looking on,
Alexander entertained New Bedford's leading colored citizen, Mr.
Freedom, with lace tablecloth and cut-glass decanter displayed. More
than seventy years after Mr. Freedom's visit, Willie described the
scene:

They sat down and talked seriously; finally my grandfather arose, filled
the wine glasses and raised his glass and touched the glass of his
friend, murmuring a toast. I had never before seen such a ceremony; I
had read about it in books, but in Great Barrington both white and black
avoided ceremony. To them it smacked of pretense.... The black
Burghardts indulged in jokes and backslapping. I suddenly sensed in my
grandfather's parlor what manners meant and how people of breeding
behaved and were able to express what we in Great Barrington were loath
to give act to, or unable. I never forgot that
toast.[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-35){#cha-35}

What Willie knew about his paternal ancestry and when are difficult to
determine precisely: the quest would still be under way when he was in
his eighties, drawing him to island pinpoints in the
Bahamas.[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-36){#cha-36} Long before
then, however, and very probably a few months after Alexander Du Bois's
death in December 1887, he learned the essentials of the story about his
father's people. Grandfather Alexander bequeathed to him all that was
left of the Du Bois memory---cryptic leatherbound diaries, whose
fragmentary hieroglyphs and tantalizing allusions Willie would decode by
the time he reached his twenty-first year. Fabulous encounters and one
or two painful secrets were embedded in the strata of his grandfather's
past, and Willie would always harbor an almost desperate need to unearth
them, cleaning and carefully restoring them to a gloss in the museum of
his mind. Grandfather Alexander was more than a little remarkable; as a
man of color in antebellum America, he was, as President Nkrumah would
say of his grandson, a phenomenon.

Alexander's movements during the 1820s and early 1830s are now
impossible to reconstruct, despite his grandson's creative attempt to do
so in the [Autobiography.]{.epub-i} Certainly, he cannot have departed
in 1821 for ten years in Haiti, as Du Bois believed, on account of his
marriage two years later in New Haven to Sarah Marsh Lewis (both were
twenty), who bore a daughter, Augusta, within the
year.[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-37){#cha-37} With almost equal
certainty, his diary places him in Haiti during 1829, midpoint in the
ambitious, repressive presidency of Jean-Pierre Boyer, an educated
mulatto ruler who fled into French exile in 1843. Under Boyer, Haiti,
the French-speaking western third of the island of Hispaniola, brutally
conquered Santo Domingo, the Spanish-speaking eastern portion,
devastated the Spanish Creole elite, doubled the size of the army, and
bound the peasantry to perpetual tillage on the great mulatto
plantations. In this way, Haiti maximized its coffee and sugar exports
to a United States whose southern parts verged on apoplexy over this
black republic's continued existence. Machiavellian politics, rampant
corruption, and brutal repression kept Haiti, chronically primed to
explode along seams of class and color,
docile.[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-38){#cha-38}

To strengthen his regime, Boyer offered land to free people of color in
the northern cities of the United States. The president's New York agent
was instructed to sell ""fifty thousand weights"" of coffee so that ""such
individuals of the African race, who groaning in the United States under
the weight of prejudice and misery"" might be resettled ""under Haitian
beneficence."" That venerable Philadelphia divine, Richard Allen, founder
and bishop of the first organized church among his people in America,
the African Methodist Episcopal (of which the Zion was an offshoot),
assumed chairmanship of the Society for Promoting the Emigration of Free
Persons to Hayti. More than two thousand came during 1824--25, quickly
found the Haitian peasants darkly suspicious, the agents of the
enterprise embezzlers or incompetents, the land useless, living
conditions deadly, and President Boyer prey to second
thoughts.[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-39){#cha-39}

As Du Bois guessed, his grandfather was a strong candidate for
involvement in this experiment. It would have been a compelling reason
for a proud, free man of color with unique ties to the Caribbean to
leave New Haven, either in some organizational capacity or as a solitary
pioneer counting on inherited connections in the island republic. Then,
as the resettlement scheme unraveled, personal relationships soured, and
Boyer's policies only aggravated what they were designed to correct,
Alexander left Haiti sometime between 1833 and 1834. Back in New Haven,
at 23 Washington Street, he resumed his grocery business and, briefly,
life with Sarah Marsh. When Sarah died in July 1834, Alexander buried
her in the family plot in Grove Street Cemetery behind Yale College. He
remarried the following year. The grocery flourished well enough, even
though Alexander was also chief steward on ships plying between New
Haven and New York. His energies were divided among the store, the
ships, and being treasurer of St. Luke's, the Episcopal church he
angrily helped form about 1842, after Trinity Parish made
African-Americans
unwelcome.[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-40){#cha-40}
Twenty-one-year-old Alexander Crummell led the Trinity Parish walkout,
serving as de facto pastor of St. Luke's, a mainspring of Free Negro
advocacy. Rivetingly eloquent, the first of his race ordained in the
Episcopal faith, the tall, lithe Crummell gloried in his black color as
much as in his abundant learning. Until Willie became Dr. William Edward
Burghardt Du Bois of Harvard and Berlin, incomparably surpassing them,
Crummell of New York's Oneida Institute and Cambridge University was
among the half dozen most carefully educated persons of his race in the
United States. Alexander's records for 1840 enumerate collection-tray
receipts for stirring public lectures in New Haven by Crummell, whose
ideas the grandson would applaud in the ennobling Crummell portrait in
[The Souls of Black
Folk.]{.epub-i}[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-41){#cha-41}

There is a ten-year hiatus in Alexander's diaries. When they resume, he
is living in Springfield, Massachusetts, possessed of an estate with a
declared value of four thousand dollars. Mary Emily Jacklyn, the second
New Haven wife, twenty when they married in 1835, had produced in fecund
sequence, between 1836 and 1842, Henrietta, Henry, Helen, Harriet, and
John, the last two recorded by the 1850 census as being in the
Springfield home. Grandfather had become a gentleman farmer, residing in
town and paying seasonal visits to the farm, and was still an occasional
communicant in the New Haven church during this roiling decade of
increasing antislavery agitation, sectional strife, and John Brown's
last-straw martyrdom.[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-42){#cha-42}
At St. Luke's, Reverend James Theodore Holly was installed as the
church's first official black rector in 1856. Freeborn in Washington,
D.C., Holly's considerable capacities had won him appointment as clerk
to Lewis Tappan, New York's leading white abolitionist, and priestly
orders in the Episcopal Church in 1855. Within weeks, Holly had
discovered his life's passion during an exploratory visit to Haiti. Upon
his return, he poured his emigrationist convictions into a famous
printed sermon on [The Capacity of the Negro Race for Self
Government.]{.epub-i} Amid the shipwreck of state, the incoming
President Lincoln, a much-troubled advocate of voluntary removal of
Africans from North America, encouraged in his endeavors the British
abolitionist James Redpath, a one-man dynamo of publicity and
fund-raising, official agent of Haiti, and director, with Holly's
dedicated assistance, of the Haytian Bureau of Emigration in
Boston.[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-43){#cha-43}

Now, as the South departed the Union and months of fecklessness at
Washington ensued, African-American leadership stampeded to Holly's
cause. The existence of the Confederate States of America meant slavery
forever. Frederick Douglass uttered words in January 1861 that totally
contradicted the combative injunctions of a lifetime: ""Whatever the
future may have in store for us, it seems plain that inducements
offeredÂ ... to remain here are few, feeble, and very uncertain."" At
Holly's invitation, Douglass and his daughter stood ready to embark for
Haiti with more than a hundred St. Luke's parishioners that May,
deciding against sailing only after news of Fort Sumter, on April 12.
Alexander Du Bois was one of the leaders of this St. Luke's exodus,
although clearly conflicted about it. ""Have thoughts of leaving the
vessel,"" a May 9 diary entry confessed, ""but want resolution to do so.""
Commitments had been made; he felt ""ashamed to back out, will wait a day
or two longer, but feel like one rushing to his fate."" Grandfather
reached Port-au-Prince on June 3: ""Jackasses, Negroes, mud, water,
soldiers, universal filth."" Another entry concluded that ""the people
have retrograded since I last saw them in 1829.... Even the very animals
appear dwarfed.""[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-44){#cha-44}

To say that history had cursed Haiti since Alexander Du Bois's last
visit was not an exaggeration. After Boyer had come Faustin-Ãlie
Soulouque, former slave and hardened veteran of Haiti's wars against
France. President Soulouque became Emperor Faustin I, after surprising
and liquidating his overconfident mulatto supporters in 1849. A
scorched-earth invasion of the now-independent Dominican Republic and
ten years of carnage within Haiti blanketed the island until Soulouque's
overthrow. Haiti's new president, Nicolas-Fabre Geffrard, securely
connected to the pigmentocracy although dark-skinned himself, was closer
to being a statesman than any of that country's nineteenth-century
rulers. Recognition by the United States of Haiti's existence had
occurred on his watch in 1861. He summoned Redpath and Holly's Haitian
Bureau into existence, imposed paper reforms in the ministries, and
appointed as his minister of education the enlightened, aggressive
FranÃ§ois-Ãlie Du Bois. Grandfather was received at the palace, the day
following his arrival, by President Geffrard and his Du Bois relative,
with whom he sailed on a government steamer to the town of St. Marc.
However Holly and his immigrants sized up their settlement east of
Port-au-Prince, Alexander decided that the experiment was hopeless.
Securing passage on a British merchant ship, he wrote in his diary that
he ""felt happy to arrive \[and\]Â ... more than happy to leave. God grant
that I may see Massachusetts again."" He sailed on June 8. Some profit
must have come from the venture, though, because on July 12 he and his
new partner, one Thomas, leased a shop on Springfield's Main Street ""at
\$150 a year.""[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-45){#cha-45}

If Frank Hosmer had made it possible for Willie to find a way out of an
impoverished, limited present to a transformed future, Grandfather
Alexander made it possible for him to transform the past. The name Du
Bois was no longer merely a formal patronymic but the link in a vital,
rich, fairly exalting chain of being. The old man of grave manners and
stoic perseverance brought Willie into communion with the spirits of the
clan, enabling him for the first time to feel truly sprung from the
Huguenot seed of that seventeenth-century seigneur, ChrÃ©tien Du Bois,
and ultimately from the primordial Geoffroi Du Bois who sailed with
William the Conqueror. The black Burghardts retained his respect---even
affection---in a formal way, but in occasional moments of unguardedness
Willie's psychic affinity, after the New Bedford summer of 1883, was
less with great-grandfather Jake and his Bantu wife in their Berkshire
hollows than with Grandfather Alexander and his transoceanic universe of
Norman knights, Caribbean notables, and black abolitionists. What an
inspiration for a fatherless young man, this grandfather who always
""held his head high, took no insults, made few friends. He was not a
'Negro'; he was a man!""[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-46){#cha-46}

Yet, for all its glamor and even some distinction, the pedigree must
have presented the young Du Bois with a formidable problem, a Medea's
robe of a gift, as potentially harmful as it was appealing. Whether or
not Annie Freeman, Alexander's widow, finally told her step-grandson
that Alfred, his father, was alive (or had recently been) in Meriden,
Connecticut, is impossible to know, but he must have begun to suspect
it. He would have suspected that the meaning of a poem about illicit
love, composed during Alexander's second voyage to Haiti, explained much
about the old man's estrangement from Alfred:

[It may be right, perchance tis wrong]{.epub-i}

[To love without the priestly ken,]{.epub-i}

[Such things are often known among]{.epub-i}

[The disappointed Sons of
Men.]{.epub-i}[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-47){#cha-47}

Since Alfred was not born in New Haven, and nothing suggests that
Alexander took Sarah Marsh to Haiti in the 1820s, he must have been born
out of wedlock---of ""love without the priestly ken,"" a product of
Haitian venture number one.

Several scenarios suggest themselves: Alfred may have come to the United
States either with his father's help or on his own as a very young man
(after the death in 1834 of Sarah Du Bois, perhaps); Alexander, dour and
outwardly moral, may have found his son's presence an intolerable
reminder of a failed economic and domestic experiment; conversely,
Alfred may have resented his situation with such bitterness that none of
his father's amends was acceptable. In any case, an illegitimate Alfred
fathered an illegitimate son, by virtue of his bigamy, deserted his
family, lived on for at least a decade after disappearing, and very
likely married a third time. Here was the downside of the Du Bois
lineage, the corrosive, humiliating part of the heritage (or so Willie
would have felt in his late-Victorian marrow) for which his particular
predicament of color and class could find no other solution than in
transcendence through ability, aplomb, and carefully calibrated amnesia.

Transcendence was already well along by his senior year of high school.
Johnny Morgan encouraged him to try writing for the [Springfield
Republican,]{.epub-i} the most influential newspaper outside New York
City and the largest newspaper in western Massachusetts, and he did,
becoming its occasional Great Barrington correspondent that year and the
next. ""The Housatonic Festival,"" September 26, 1884, ""From Our Special
Correspondent,"" must be one of his three or four (unsigned) lost
articles. Readers of the [Globe]{.epub-i} had read his piece on the
topping off the year before of the rebuilt First Congregational Church.
Only the granite walls of the church had withstood the fire leaping out
of the basement furnace room one Saturday evening in early March 1882.
Communicants and fellow townspeople had immediately rallied to rebuild
the steepled structure on its 139-year-old foundations. More than one
hundred thousand dollars were contributed by the Hopkins family
alone---descendants of the renowned Reverend Samuel Hopkins, the
church's doctrinally exigent first pastor. The splendid new 3,594-pipe
organ, built by the firm of Hilborne L. Roosevelt, was so massive that
the Hopkinses had to provide additional funds to construct a loft for it
at the rear of the church. Willie and Mary Silvina attended the
dedicatory service on September 21, 1883. The six-hundred-plus audience
was mammoth for Great Barrington, with persons coming from as far away
as Springfield. The organist for the occasion, Albert A. Stanley of
Providence, Rhode Island, was one of New England's finest; his recital
that evening on the Roosevelt organ would live on in the collective
memory of the town, the round chords of Sodermann, Delibes, and
Mendelssohn's ""Spring Song"" reverberating from the new walls of what was
now one of New England's most imposing tabernacles. Great Barrington's
First Congregational Church was simply the ""handsomest church in the
county, and compares with any in the State,"" Willie's [Globe]{.epub-i}
dispatch boasted.

Willie's religious beliefs at this time were superficially orthodox and
anchored in the rigorous Calvinism of New England Congregationalism. The
First Congregational Church's Articles of Faith had remained steadfast
in their ""Hopkinsian"" rigor---a rigor proceeding virtually
arrow-straight from the tenets of the great divine, the Reverend
Jonathan Edwards, and his Yale disciple Samuel Hopkins, through the
teachings of Professor Edwards A. Park of Andover Theological Seminary
to Evarts Scudder, the admired pastor whose twenty-eight-year tenure
(1867--1895) would be the second longest since the church's founding in
1743: the divine authority of the Bible was to be interpreted literally;
man's nature was sinful; salvation was possible solely through
sanctification by Christ; and the wicked were to roast everlastingly in
Hell. Mary Silvina is recorded as having been formally admitted to
membership in Reverend Scudder's congregation in 1878. Prior to that
time, the family tradition had been to attend the Episcopal Church a few
blocks farther along Main Street, but First Congregational was closer
and its pastor was friendlier. It is extremely doubtful that Mary
Silvina would have harbored any reservations about the theological
literalism at First Congregational. As for Willie, participation in the
church's Sunday school was, like his role among the AME Zion
parishioners, another opportunity to shine. He savored the building's
lavish, sunlit appointments made possible in large part by the largesse
of Mrs. Mark Hopkins and of Timothy, her adopted son who lived on a
ducal estate in Menlo Park, California. ""The new Sunday School building
was my chief pride and joy,"" Willie fondly remembered long afterward.
""The carpet, the chairs, the tables, were all new, and the teachers were
inspired to new efforts with their growing classes.""

Willie was, as he himself put it, ""quite in his element"" as he ""led in
discussions, with embarrassing questions."" He showed off in Greek, being
""proudly able to read: ['He alethia eleutherosi humas']{.epub-i} (The
truth shall make you free),"" and he may well have been more of a
nuisance to his fellow Sunday school communicants than the awesome
interlocutor he fancied himself. He became ""both popular and a little
dreaded,"" he says, as he served up ""long disquisitions"" on the Hebrew
scriptures. What his genuine religious beliefs were, though, is unclear.
Such was his precocity that Willie would have been intrigued by almost
any well-reasoned, controversial idea. Although the dynamic Reverend
Scudder set himself uncompromisingly athwart the liberal theological
currents just beginning to waft through Congregationalism, his vigilance
proved barely adequate to the task even in his own church. Judge Dewey
was as progressive in theological matters as he was irascible. The
Articles of Faith were outmoded, he maintained, for which Scudder
denounced him from the pulpit. One Sunday morning in 1881, nevertheless,
Judge Dewey had revealed to the Great Barrington Bible Society that,
based on his readings of the latest criticism, he now believed that
God's message was not absolute but progressive---that that which ""is
later is higher"" than the earliest revelations of the Old Testament. It
was even suggested that non-Christians might not be damned for all
eternity. The clangorous dispute over the substituting of Welch's
unfermented grape juice for communion wine caused Judge Dewey to storm
out of First Congregational into the Episcopal (temporarily) and left a
deep trace in Willie's
memory.[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-48){#cha-48}

Great Barrington, then, was being penetrated by ecumenical and
relativistic notions at the very time Willie was beginning to examine
the teachings of his Congregational faith. It seems plausible to
conjecture that, while his formal religious beliefs stayed well within
the circle of orthodoxy, Willie's fierce dislike of narrow, intolerant
religious thinking (soon to manifest itself in college) was nurtured in
the church ferment along Main Street. Within a few years after the
memorable 1883 dedication ceremony for the grand church building, he
would hold theological beliefs that would have scandalized Reverend
Scudder; but Willie's ethical beliefs would remain, in their Calvinist
essence, as firm as the dolomite from the Hopkins quarry used to rebuild
Scudder's church. The promise of salvation would lie in the social
sciences, not the Bible; damnation lay in store for those who led
unexamined lives or who squandered their talents; above all, inner
strength and quiet resolve he deemed to be attributes possessed by the
elect.

Whatever his bedrock beliefs at the time, Willie knew that the church
could help promote him in life, and his Sunday school enthusiasms were
largely a vehicle to further that eventuality, just as his affiliation
with the AME Zion congregation advanced his social side. Neither the god
of Moses nor the redeeming Christ appears to have spoken deeply to Mary
Silvina's brainy, self-absorbed son. On the other hand, the prose of the
King James Version registered powerfully, complementing the influence of
Macaulay. It may have been a case of medium over message---of the way in
which the Lord and His servants spoke, rather than of what they said.

Meanwhile, schoolwork went along dazzlingly. The records for the high
school years are lost or destroyed, but memories of Willie's academic
rage to succeed persist even today among some of the townspeople. There
were seven boys and six girls in the graduation class. The evening
ceremony was held at the town hall on June 27, 1884, a Friday, followed
by a reception at GBHS. The [Berkshire Courier]{.epub-i} reported that
there were declamations interspersed with music by the Germania
Orchestra of Pittsfield after the opening prayer by Reverend C. W.
Mallory of Housatonic. It must have been a long evening, with the
program preliminaries, music, and thirteen finest-hour recitations.
Salutatorian James Parker offered a spirited ""Defense of Andrew
Johnson,"" followed by Mary Frein's celebration of Berkshire beauty, and
a little later Minnie Ford's clever, warmly applauded speech about the
pleasures of reading. Looking ""somewhat drawn"" but proud, Mary Silvina,
and probably Uncle James and other Burghardts, heard Willie deliver an
oration on Wendell Phillips, the conscience of New England abolitionism.
It was the success of the evening, the [Berkshire Courier]{.epub-i}
reporter judging that ""William E. Dubois \[sic\] a colored lad who has
had good standing"" gave an excellent oration and ""provoked repeated
applause."" George Beebee's Longfellow recitation and valedictorian Abbie
Joyner's ""Knownothingism"" were somewhat
upstaged.[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-49){#cha-49}

Phillips had died recently, the ""gatling gun"" mind described by Van Wyck
Brooks slowing down, but its sweeping arc blasting away at capitalism
until the end. Phillips had become more radical, isolated from the
compromisers who announced in 1870, as they dissolved the Abolitionist
Movement, that the Fifteenth Amendment was all African-Americans needed
to forge ahead. Fellow Brahmins, like Charles Sumner and Charles Francis
Adams, who rallied to Horace Greeley's insurgent Liberal Republican
party because the Grant presidency was corrupt, because the Bourbon
South promised to behave if left alone with its ""Negroes,"" and because
the votes of western farmers and southern planters were said to be had
in exchange for lower tariffs---they and all these rationalizations
earned Phillips's eloquent, withering contempt. ""Our work is not done,""
he had lectured the Garrisons and the Whittiers when the American
Anti-Slavery Society was dismantled, ""we probably never shall live to
see it done."" Moral righteousness impelled him from the rights of former
slaves and women to greenbackism and unionism. In his seventies, he
became a paladin of socialism. ""We affirm as a fundamental principle,""
Phillips wrote in [The Labor Question,]{.epub-i} ""that labor, the
creator of wealth, is entitled to all it
creates.""[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-50){#cha-50}

Although neither the speaker nor anyone in the audience could then have
possibly guessed, the public career of Wendell Phillips uncannily
prefigured that of William Edward Burghardt Du Bois. Even though the
Phillips that evening was not Phillips the economic radical but Phillips
the abolitionist stalwart, it was more than hindsight when Willie wrote
much later of being fascinated by ""his life and work and \[taking\] a
long step toward a wider conception"" of what he was going to do because
of Phillips's example. Looking back on that graduation summer, it can
now be seen just how relevant Phillips's double message of racial and
economic justice was. Just three weeks after his town-hall oration,
Willie could have read the enormously popular James G. Blaine's letter
of acceptance of the Republican party's presidential nomination in the
[Springfield Republican.]{.epub-i} Blaine of Maine, the ""Plumed Knight,""
former secretary of state and twice candidate for the presidency,
pledged, if elected, to uphold the 1877 bargain with the Bourbon South.
""It would be a great calamity,"" the letter stated, ""to change these
influences under which southern commonwealths are learning to vindicate
civil rights and adapting themselves to the conditions of political
tranquility and industrial progress."" New England humanitarianism was
then running at low tide, as dark alarms about troublesome European
immigrants prompted contrite, collusive sympathy for the white South on
the part of erstwhile abolitionists turned
businessmen.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-51){#cha-51}

There had been talk of Williams College during his graduation year, but
Willie dreamed of going to Harvard. That he was going to go to college
had been ""settled in \[his\] own mind"" ever since Hosmer steered him
into the preparatory
curriculum.[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-52){#cha-52} The problem
was not just money, however. The money might be earned or borrowed.
There was the care of failing Mary Silvina. She wanted college for
Willie as much as he did, but the loyal, humane thing for him to do was
to stay in Great Barrington working to help support her. He was only
sixteen, anyway. College could wait another year or two. Meantime,
unlike many boys his age in an era of early marriages, Willie seems to
have been undistracted from his goal by the opposite sex. For a
sensitive, well-behaved male of sixteen, and in that time and place, his
innocence of the opposite sex was not all that unusual. Except for a
single, coy reference in the [Autobiography]{.epub-i} to a ""lovely
little plump, brown girl who appeared out of nowhere, and smiled at me
demurely,"" girls had significance solely as classmates or relatives in
the Great Barrington
narratives.[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-53){#cha-53} Willie's
class consciousness and the town's attitude toward interracial courtship
compounded a boy's otherwise difficult-enough life after puberty. But he
was not only innocent of girls, he seems to have been wholly uninvolved.
The closeness of mother and son could have been an underlying cause or
effect of that innocence. He was, after all, her world, her future, her
vindication. Her son knew Latin, even Greek. He was her marvel. Her
brilliant Willie was certainly not going to consort with plump, smiling
brown girls if Mary Silvina could help it. Watchful indulgence and
subtle imperatives tied him to her in a mutual dependency.

Yet it seems not too psychologically speculative to detect latent
resentment on Willie's part. Gnawing suspicions (possibly even a few
hard facts) about the reasons for his father's disappearance led him to
cling to paternal mythology---to gild Alfred's portrait---and to blame
Mary Silvina for removing him from their lives. After all, it was she
who had acquiesced in the Burghardt clan's putative opposition to their
going to Connecticut. At bottom, she had deserted his father and was
largely responsible, therefore, for their demeaning material predicament
in Great Barrington. Undereducated and infirm, Mary Silvina, his ""good
chum,"" was now an albatross, although the more this cruel, disloyal
thought insinuated itself, the more evasive, ambivalent, and wretched
Willie's feelings for her must have become. He knew that she lived
almost entirely to see him prosper in the world, that she would die for
him if need be. But if his mother were to die, then it surely followed
that his life would make sense only if he repayed her sacrifice with
extraordinary success---a success in which no other woman would ever be
included as a full participant. In ""The Damnation of Women,"" a midlife
essay of great emotion and feminist conviction, Willie would write of
the sad truth and pain behind these shaping Berkshire years. ""Only at
the sacrifice of intelligence and the chance to do their best work can
the majority of modern women bear children,"" he
lamented.[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-54){#cha-54} Pondering
what his ""good chum"" mother and his ""pretty, brown"" cousin Inez
represented, Willie tells us that they ""existed not for themselves, but
for men."" He owed them a great deal, indeed.

Suddenly, Mary Silvina was gone, dead of an apoplectic stroke and buried
in the last week in March 1885. For all the tender words of affection
and comradeship, Willie's grief is oddly formal, repressed,
intellectualized. In both [Darkwater]{.epub-i} and the
[Autobiography]{.epub-i} he writes of relief, of ""choking gladness"" to
see her at last at peace, and gives the wrong year for her death. ""Of my
own loss,"" he tells us, he had then ""little realization. That came only
in after years. Now it was the choking gladness and solemn feel of
wings!"" He may have been shaken to the core by his mother's death,
manfully holding in his grief as a stoic New England teenager ought to,
until emotions could burst through in some private corner after her
burial. On the other hand, feeling frankly relieved as he did at her
release from wearying debility, yet feeling guilty, too, because Mary
Silvina's death ended his own suffocating calvary and flashed a green
light to his future, Willie may not have known, in the whipsaw of such
conflict, which emotional chord to sound. What gave the appearance of
extreme control may have been in reality a state of emotional
paralysis---a failure to grieve and a freezing up of oedipal
disengagement. Whatever her death really meant to him, the timing was
perfect. One more obstacle to Harvard College had fallen. Finally, he
was free to begin redefining
himself.[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-55){#cha-55}

Aunt Minerva, one of Mary Silvina's sisters, took him in, and the
African-American community, about which he says always as little as
possible, came to his rescue. J. Carlisle Dennis, a steward recently
arrived from San Francisco with the widow of railroad prince Mark
Hopkins, having ascended almost overnight to the pinnacle of local
""colored"" society, broadcast the community's pride in ""young Willie Du
Bois,"" writing as J. C. D. in his July 8 letter to the [Globe]{.epub-i}
about the overly modest scholar:

Du Bois entered school under many disadvantages; being his widowed
mother's only support, he was compelled to perform odd jobs between
school hours for the friendly neighbors. By persistent, industrious
effort he has accomplished the results hoped forÂ ... and is considered
by all who know him to be one of the most promising young colored men of
the times. Du Bois is the youngest of his class, being only
sixteen.[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-56){#cha-56}

Dennis was a relatively young man and, like Willie, possessed of ability
and pretensions. They liked each other, and Dennis, as chief steward to
Mrs. Mark Hopkins, was in a position to be uniquely helpful. Mary
Frances Hopkins was a Great Barrington Kellogg whose considerable wealth
had been a hefty factor in the Gilded Age rise and railroad predations
of her deceased husband. Now she was back from California, conferring
with bankers, architects, and builders in her Victorian on Main Street.
Her castellated mansion of blue dolomite and fourteen rare pink marble
columns rose throughout the spring of 1885, a McKim, Mead & White
version of the Chenonceaux chateau. In all her deliberations, Dennis,
debonair and slightly swarthy, stood by her side. And as the vast pile
of masonry rose, thanks to Dennis, Willie Du Bois sat in a shed keeping
time on the army of laborers at the ""fabulous wage"" of a dollar a day.
Dennis may have been, as Willie believed, Mrs. Hopkins's lover,
although, given their age difference and her eventual marriage to her
decorator, Edward Searles, who was almost surely homosexual, the truth
of the story might be quite different. ""Searles had the glamour and the
clothes of an English gentleman,"" the timekeeper recalls, ""and soon the
whole direction and control of the Hopkins fortune passed into his
hands."" Willie's friend Dennis is said to have committed suicide. But
Searles (whose name attaches to this day to the castle) came from
Methuen, Massachusetts, not from England; and he was not an architect
but a very saucy interior decorator. Our timekeeper, however, remembers
talking ""with the contractors,"" poring ""over the plans and
specifications and even came in some contact with the distinguished
English architect,
Searles.""[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-57){#cha-57} The Searles
Castle experience was one Willie liked to recount, and his
embellishments reflected two lifelong predilections---for illustration
over accuracy and his prominence in events.

Searles Castle rose and Leavitt's gigantic barn burned down that summer.
The [Springfield Republican]{.epub-i} carried Willie's eyewitness
account of the fire, his farewell dispatch from Great Barrington. He
would be gone before the town's next momentous happening, the first
practical demonstration in America of the alternating-current lighting
system in March 1886. But he was not going to Harvard. The reconstructed
Harvard of President Charles W. Eliot had admission standards that were
probably just a cut above what had been offered at GBHS. Money remained
a big problem, even with his timekeeper windfall. And there was the
racial factor, the distinct lack of enthusiasm among so many otherwise
kindly, charitable white people for helping even a brilliant ""Negro"" to
attend the nation's leading college. Hosmer got busy just as Willie
began the job at the castle, finding an ally in the principal of the
private school, Edward Van Lennup. They were joined by Reverend Scudder
and Reverend C. C. Painter, another Congregationalist brother and former
official of the Federal Indian Bureau. Through their efforts, four
Congregational churches pledged twenty-five dollars each for four years
to underwrite Willie's education at Fisk University, a Congregational
school for Negroes in Nashville,
Tennessee.[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-58){#cha-58}

Willie disguised his disappointment masterfully. His Burghardt relatives
supposedly grumbled about his going South. He says he did not. For him,
it was a great adventure into the unknown, sort of an educational safari
among the fascinating and barbarous---""the South of slavery, rebellion,
and black folk."" He would finally meet other people of color like
himself. They were still a mystery, these vibrant people, Willie reminds
us again. With the exception of the Providence Emancipation Day picnic
and the Hampton Institute quartet that had ""thrilled \[him\] to tears""
in the First Congregationalist Church not long ago, what did he know of
The Negro? And so he was ""glad to go to Fisk."" In a sense, he
represented the new thrust of New England uplift. African-Americans in
the South ""needed trained leadership. I was sent to furnish it."" Harvard
was not lost---the thought never occurred to him---merely adjourned.
Meanwhile, the ""age of miracles"" had
begun.[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter3-59){#cha-59}

C[RISES AT]{.epub-sc} [T[HE]{.epub-sc} C[RISIS]{.epub-sc}]{.epub-i}

I[T WAS]{.epub-sc} still audacious in 1913 to write, as William Ferris
did, that ""Mr. Washington is now a waning influence in the country
amongst the colored people,"" that Du Bois's star was ""in the
ascendancy,"" and that [The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i} was the
""political bible of the Negro race."" With a bachelors degree from Yale
(1891) and a masters from Harvard (1900), the thirty-nine-year-old
Ferris had been one of the first recruits to the Niagara Movement,
although his usual state of financial duress as free-lance journalist
and lecturer seems to have kept him from attending the annual meetings.
Recently, he had been treated to a dose of Du Bois's most solvent
candor, via a reproving note in which Du Bois said Ferris was ""lazy and
will not keep clean,"" which precluded companionship with ""people of your
intellectual level."" Admiration for the Crisis editor remained unshaken,
nevertheless, and if personal hygiene continued to make Ferris an
infrequent guest at the interracial Civic Club, Du Bois held his nose
long enough to praise [The African Abroad or His Evolution in Western
Civilization,]{.epub-i} Ferris's 1913, two-volume tour de force, as
""keen and even brilliant in parts."" A disjointed display of
nineteenth-century learning, in which history fulfilled the Hegelian
world spirit, the Anglo-Saxon race was the ""advance guard of
civilization,"" and the ""Negrosaxon"" was endowed with uplifting
""spiritual and emotional qualities,"" the book was also a panegyric to Du
Bois, whom Ferris called ""the political messiah of the
race.""[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-1){#cha-1}

Nevertheless, in the official mind of white America Booker T. Washington
still reigned, and a great many African-Americans, North and South,
would also have questioned Ferris's judgment. True, Washington's
intimates saw a rapid decline from the remarkable vigor he had exhibited
in the days before the Tenderloin incident. His physicians either could
not or would not identify precisely what was causing his nervous
system's progressive collapse. Increasingly, Emmett Scott carried the
load. Under Woodrow Wilson, the Tuskegee principal no longer held
anything like the political influence he had appeared to exert during
Roosevelt's two terms. His two most powerful agents, Charles Anderson
and William Lewis, had been forced to resign their plum federal
appointments. Yet he was still a considerable force among his own
people, and, as far as most influential white people were concerned, he
was the only reliable one. When Ruth Baldwin, William's widow, helped
create the National Urban League in 1910, the Wizard and his allies were
able to extend their influence to an African-American organization
well-funded enough to rival the NAACP Men like George F. Peabody
remained almost blindly trusting in Washington and sick at heart about
Du Bois's loud agitation and defiance. He knew of no people ""whose
splendid attitudes throughout hundreds of years so fully confirms the
virtue and ultimate value of non-resistance,"" Peabody wrote Du Bois,
chastising him for his attacks ""on individuals who are leaders of the
movement."" Washington himself seemed to be evolving with the times,
speaking out more about egregious racial discrimination, encouraging (by
letter and telegram) resistance to residential segregation, lending his
name to a successfully organized public protest against a bill in the
Senate to bar immigration of Africans to the United States, and even
going as far as to write an article in the November 1912 [Century
Magazine]{.epub-i} deploring labor exploitation of convicts, lynching,
disfranchisement, inequalities in education, and the rank injustice of
substandard separate transportation facilities. Although he opposed
outright censorship, he joined the chorus condemning the vicious
propaganda of D. W. Griffith's [The Birth of a
Nation.]{.epub-i}[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-2){#cha-2}

But Washington was trying awkwardly and too late to accommodate deep and
broad developments that enhanced Du Bois's leadership with each passing
year. Segregation in the South after 1890 dulled minds and reduced tens
of thousands to torpor, as was its economic and political design, yet
the new version of white supremacy continued to encounter real
resistance. Jim Crow, with its posted signs and arbitrary customs, could
demoralize and intimidate through a thousand daily indignities. It could
destroy livelihoods and entire neighborhoods periodically, as in
Wilmington in 1898 and Atlanta in 1906, but the permanent leveling of
the small merchant and professional classes of the cities and
towns---classes that Du Bois's Atlanta University Studies showed were
managing to prosper despite cruel and bulky obstacles---would have been
counterproductive for the white South itself. The generation of
African-Americans born after slavery was in its mid-forties and the
next, like Yolande, was entering its teens. They were already reading
[The Crisis,]{.epub-i} and many would soon come under the influence of
local branches of the NAACP. And there was steady movement out of the
South as thousands voted with their feet against Jim Crow and went to
make a living in the East and Midwest. These were motivated men and
women, many skilled and schooled, who filled the ranks of the older,
established African-American urban communities where Washington's
agrarian and vocational program had an appeal now every bit as faint as
the white South's memory of the bargain struck at Atlanta in
1895.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-3){#cha-3}

Ironically, the Wizard himself had named the phenomenon that now
undermined his power and appeal in a book published under his signature
in 1900, [The New Negro for a New Century,]{.epub-i} but Du Bois had
unveiled the soul of that Negro. The latter's star was rising, if not
yet as brilliantly as Ferris claimed. Overwhelmingly, the Talented Tenth
thought and spoke Du Bois. Its civil rights organizations, colleges,
clubs, and Greek letter and professional societies were increasingly
imbued with and guided by his ideals and goals. When he declared long
afterward in [Dusk of Dawn]{.epub-i} that his ""stinging hammer blows
made Negroes aware of themselvesÂ ... so much so that today common
slogans among the Negro people are taken bodily from the words of my
mouth,"" he was referring to the triumph of the trend that Ferris had
ballyhooed. To believe Du Bois, however, although he was willing to
inaugurate and give authoritative direction to the trend, he had no
desire to lead a civil rights organization. Just as he protested that
his Niagara Movement role had distracted him from scholarship and taxed
his personality, he insisted that he wanted only to be left alone to run
[The Crisis.]{.epub-i} He was not a ""'mixer' and there is no use in my
trying to be a popular leader,"" he wrote old Boston friend Butler
Wilson. He had not ""and never had a desire to lead the
NAACP.""[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-4){#cha-4}

Du Bois said this repeatedly. He saw himself as an intellectual turned
propagandist, not as the general officer of an organization. On the
other hand, there would be more than a few crises within the association
that would convince him of the racial or moral necessity to assume
command of institutional tasks that he would otherwise have wished to
renounce. It was not in his nature, after all, to doubt his capacity.
What controlled his every decision was the form and the reality within
the NAACP of interracial deference, of active participation by the
African-American officers. As he wrote later, ""ordinarily the white
members of the committee formed of Negroes and whites"" dominated that
committee. On the other hand, ""if the Negroes attempt to dominate and
conduct the committee, the whites become dissatisfied and gradually
withdraw."" This was an [idÃ©e fixe,]{.epub-i} a chronic Du Boisian
sensibility of such tenderness that even the doting, keenly empathetic
Mary Ovington sometimes failed to gauge it accurately. Yet she also
understood why she failed to, once confessing to Oswald Villard that she
found herself ""still occasionally forgetting that the Negroes weren't
poor people for whom I must kindly do something.... They were men with
most forceful opinions of their
own.""[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-5){#cha-5} Any perception of
the slightest racially tinged condescension or arbitrariness caused her
friend to react instantaneously, vigorously, and not infrequently with
an acerbity that even his partisans thought overblown or plain petty.

Du Boisian displeasure was almost never like an explosion; it was a
shard of ice down the back. Time and again, Villard, Florence Kelley,
Joel Spingarn, and other well-meaning officers would depart from the
boardroom in a redfaced hurry, discommoded and furious. This behavior
was strategic; Du Bois understood that the best defense is usually an
offensive one, and that the harder and oftener hit they were, the more
likely rich and powerful white people were to learn to couple genuine
consideration with formal civility. Obedient to this preemptive tactic,
Du Bois conducted himself in public like a wary lion, concealing
uncertainty and sensitivity behind a proud tread and a readiness to
spring at the first shadow in his path. The effect was one of intriguing
unapproachability at its best. At its worst, it seemed boorishly
arrogant, and on rare occasions he was called to account. Passing John
Milholland's daughter, Inez, on Fifth Avenue near the public library one
afternoon, Du Bois had looked straight ahead, not even touching the brim
of his hat. When the fiery young suffragist charged into his office to
demand an explanation---""You didn't speak to me!""---a stunned Du Bois
fumbled for an explanation. ""I didn't know whether she would dare to
speak to me.... It wasn't up to me,"" he protested.

But there was more to it than that. An attentive reading of ""The Souls
of White Folk,"" written for the [Independent]{.epub-i} in the summer of
1910, reveals a profound hardening of Du Bois's expectations of white
people. A coruscating essay, it was a dark coda to [The Souls of Black
Folk.]{.epub-i} Culture made races different, and some races were
demonstrably more advanced than others, Du Bois granted, but he railed
against what he took to be the unique racial perversion foisted on
mankind by Western civilization during the nineteenth century: ""Those in
whose minds the paleness of their bodily skins is fraught with
tremendous and eternal significance."" Yet in the sweep of time, the
achievements of white folk were as recent as yesterday, he reminded
readers. What tragicomic arrogance, he fumed, is the presumption that
""whiteness alone is candy to the world child."" At every turn, whether
stated outright or revealed in facial expressions, Du Bois read the
thought, ""My poor un-white thing! Weep not nor rage."" Interracial
hypocrisy was the lot even of reformers, because, like the great
majority of white souls, they tended to see only the color of a man's or
woman's ability:

So long, then, as humble black folk, voluble with thanks receive barrels
of old clothes from lordly and generous whites, there is much mental and
moral satisfaction. But when the black man begins to dispute the white
man's title to certain alleged bequests of the Father's in wage and
position, authority and training; and when his attitude toward charity
is sullen anger rather than humble jollity; when he insists on his human
right to swagger and swear and waste---then the spell is suddenly broken
and the philanthropist is apt to be ready to believe that Negroes are
impudent \[and that\] the South is
right....[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-6){#cha-6}

Du Bois took this mindset from Atlanta University to Vesey Street.
""Boldly and without flinching,"" he threw down the gauntlet to those
false collaborators ""who call themselves philanthropists, and Christians
and gentlemen,"" in ""A Philosophy for 1913"" in the January
[Crisis.]{.epub-i}

[The Crisis]{.epub-i} was to remain a paradox from its inception---a
self-financing publication whose freewheeling, militant editor was
expected to advance policies of an organization guided by the careful
decisions of a board of directors. With Du Bois formally answerable to
the NAACP board, on which he sat as one of the thirty directors, paradox
was compounded by anomaly. It was as though the first and last links in
the NAACP chain of command connected to form a
circle.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-7){#cha-7} A good portion of
the trouble derived from the fact that the association was in its
infancy, its tactics of protest still inchoate, and its bureaucratic
structures still evolving. With its incorporation in May 1911 and its
adoption of Albert Pillsbury's constitution the following month, the
NAACP's founding executive committee yielded to a thirty-member board of
directors presided over by a president (Storey), two or more
vice-presidents (Milholland and Bishop Walters), and a chairman
(Villard). The salaried secretary, whose decision-making power within
the association would eventually rival the chairman's, was for the time
being a subordinate employee (the frustrated Frances Blascoer). Although
the full powers of office were not spelled out at the first board
meeting in February 1912 (a second constitution and new bylaws would be
drafted and approved in July 1914), Villard, the dedicated, imperious
board chairman, naturally expected to be deferred to by his colleagues,
most of whom were in fact content to do so. Ovington, for instance,
seemed at first to be a model of compliancy---""a most ladylike, refined
and cultivated person,"" the chairman wrote Uncle Francis. Moreover, she
continued to be busy with labor conditions and settlement-house
activities that had provided the grist for [Half a Man,]{.epub-i} her
perceptive study of the social and economic conditions of New York's
African-Americans. As for salaried officers, they were expected to
implement the will of the board (as communicated through the orders of
the chairman) with a minimum of dissent. Press lord Villard intended to
run the NAACP with the same hierarchical vigor that had been
successfully applied to the new version of [The Nation,]{.epub-i} which
he predicted would be a ""broad, fine paper with O.G.V as absolute
dictator of the policy.""[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-8){#cha-8}

The first of many major disputes involving conflict over authority came
to a head early in 1913. It was inevitable that, in the start-up
competition for the association's modest resources, issues would become
personalized and personalities would become inflated into issues. Du
Bois's participation, however, put the inevitable into overdrive. He and
Villard were kindred egos whose interplay was complicated by racial
presumptions and haunted by John Brown's ghost. Collaboration could
never have been other than conditional, edgy, and flammable, but Du Bois
saw his role in the association as so indispensable and symbolic that
virtually any interference was judged to be either racist or perverse.
With a fair measure of grace, he suffered Villard's displeasure over the
writing of [The Negro]{.epub-i} on the NAACP's time. But when he was
informed in the spring of 1913 that, in the interests of balanced
reporting, [The Crisis]{.epub-i} should regularly publish a list of
crimes committed by African-Americans, Du Bois's forbearance ended, and
he bluntly refused. ""I count myself not as your subordinate,"" he wrote
Villard, ""but as a fellow officer."" Called to settle the dispute, the
board sided with Du Bois against Villard, probably, in part, to scotch
any suggestion of undue white influence on policy, but also because,
above all, as Walling reminded Villard and another board member the
following year, they must ""attach an extreme value to \[Du Bois's\]
services to the Association and the cause."" The board's rebuff was more
than Villard could tolerate. No organization could be run effectively
from three centers of authority---his own, Du Bois's, and the board's.
On April 2, 1913, a stern note reached the editor's desk: ""Will you
kindly make sure that my name does not appear as Contributing Editor of
[The Crisis]{.epub-i} from this time
forth.""[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-9){#cha-9}

Meanwhile, trouble was brewing from another quarter. At first, Du Bois
ignored the intrusions of the new, salaried secretary, May Childs
Nerney, a young, hot-tempered, former librarian recruited by Ovington,
who brought both prodigious energy and abrasive conduct to her multiple
tasks of fund-raising, publicity, branch development, and legal affairs.
Blascoer, her predecessor, had wilted under the strain of her work.
After resigning in March 1911, she continued for a time as a field
officer, a shadowy figure whose salary Storey assumed as much for
charity's sake as from real benefit to the association. Taking up her
duties in May 1912, Nerney was far tougher than Blascoer, fully prepared
to deal forcefully with the egos in Vesey Street---Villard, Ovington,
Walters, and, most recently, former Columbia Professor Joel Elias
Spingarn---in which company Du Bois ranked first among equals. From his
bastion in Publicity and Research, the editor observed her brusque
arrival and commended her program to build up the branches, advertise
the association, and, selectively but vigorously, sue those guilty of
discrimination. He found her outspokenness refreshing, and very likely
enjoyed her occasional sarcasm about the elderly Storey and the elegant
Spingarn. She was, he told an associate, ""of excellent spirit and
indefatigable energy.""[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-10){#cha-10}

But he was wary. For Nerney, the association's mission demanded full
cooperation from [The Crisis]{.epub-i}; even its subordination, if need
be. For Du Bois, the relationship between the NAACP and [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} was governed by the otherwise repellent doctrine of
separate but equal; and the subordination of the former to the latter,
if need be. The mind that once confessed to its midnight diary that it
would raise a race or die trying was an unfamiliar type to the former
white employee of the state library in Albany, New York. Nerney could
not be expected to concede that the lucid yet mystical editor with the
goatee held a monopoly over the ideals and aspirations of assertive
African-Americans. For the emergent class of urban-bred professionals,
Du Bois [was]{.epub-i} the NAACP, and, as Walling sighed, it was simply
necessary ""to make the most sweeping concessions in order to give him
free play to exercise all his abilities and energy and enthusiasm.""
Missing the significance of Walling's dictum, Nerney immediately pushed
a reorganization program and began to complain to the board that Du Bois
put the business of his department before that of the NAACP, citing the
repeated failure of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} to carry enough news about the
association or to prepare and print pamphlets containing general or
current information. Furthermore, she soon ran afoul of Dill, now
serving as Du Bois's devoted but apparently not very competent
secretary. A great hubbub was raised over a direct order of Nerney's
about some minor matter that Dill had adamantly and with bare courtesy
refused to obey. Complaining that Dill was insolent and uncooperative,
Nerney insisted on his dismissal. When Dill stayed, Nerney tendered her
own resignation in February 1913, but Villard persuaded her to
reconsider and gave her a new
office.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-11){#cha-11}

In the spring of 1913, Villard had persuaded the board to create two
committees in order to increase the association's efficiency. The first,
charged with devising systems and economies, was composed of the dutiful
Ovington; the very social Charles Studin, who was a politically
ambitious attorney practicing law with Joel Spingarn's ebullient
brother, Arthur; the wealthy Chicago businessman and uneasy NAACP
treasurer, Walter Sachs; and Francis Batchelder, the accountant brother
of Ovington's secretary. The second committee was supposed to advise
[The Crisis.]{.epub-i} Ovington, Joel Spingarn, and Reverend William
Brooks assumed the responsibility for encouraging Du Bois to become more
responsive to the organizational needs of the association. But neither
the NAACP nor [The Crisis]{.epub-i} was susceptible to correction by
committee. The board continued to toss in a sea of policy conflict, even
debating what to call the organization---either ""New Abolition Movement""
or ""Garrison-Douglass
Association.""[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-12){#cha-12} New
Yorkers Milholland, Walling, and Russell attended board meetings
irregularly and gradually lapsed into passivity.

Tensions in the New York headquarters caused or exacerbated tensions in
the association's affiliates. In Chicago, Ida Wells-Barnett once and for
all withdrew from association affairs after Villard tactlessly convened
a meeting of the local branch without informing her. In Washington, the
second-largest branch was in raucous disarray as Archibald GrimkÃ© and
other dissidents tried to oust Milton Waldron, the local president, for
soft-pedaling criticism of Woodrow Wilson's federal segregation
policies, allegedly in order to gain political office. Vice-President
Walters, whose self-esteem was every bit as healthy as the chairman's,
finally resigned his office in November after Villard publicly drew a
connection between Walters's appointment as minister to Liberia and his
reluctance to attack Wilson's segregationist policies. GrimkÃ© took his
place. In Boston, a sulky Monroe Trotter obstructed the work of the
local branch, partly because of Du Bois's barely concealed disregard.
The January 1914 [Crisis]{.epub-i} had somehow not found it newsworthy
that a Trotter-led delegation from the National Equal Rights League had
made national headlines by being granted an audience with President
Wilson to protest federal segregationist policies. Storey sent a formal
complaint to Spingarn's Crisis committee, which Du Bois answered by
claiming (unconvincingly) that the magazine's copy had already been
set.[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-13){#cha-13}

Du Bois continued on his own course, taking an extended promotional
circuit throughout the Southwest into California and Oregon during
summer 1913. ""Twenty-eight talks to audiences aggregating 18,000 human
souls,"" he rhapsodized in [The Crisis,]{.epub-i} and he claimed to be
""overwhelmed almost to silence"" by all that he had seen, heard, and
felt. Censorious [Crisis]{.epub-i} editorials rained down on the black
church, black colleges, and black newspapers, as well as the sympathetic
[Survey Graphic]{.epub-i} for declining to publish one of his essays. He
continued to be polite toward Nerney, though now he quietly complained
that she had a ""violent temper and \[was\] depressingly suspicious of
motives."" Nerney herself slowly came to appreciate the complexities of
her position, writing to GrimkÃ©, whom she had begun cultivating as an
ally against Du Bois, ""really this job requires more tact and patience
than I possess.""[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-14){#cha-14}
Although she still found Du Bois's arrogance troubling, Nerney also
wrote that she was ""beginning to understand better everyday Mr. Du
Bois's attitude"" as Villard behaved even more high-handedly than the
editor. She was about ready to fall in line with a plan to strip the
chairman of his powers. Her plan, however, called for replacing Villard
not with Du Bois but with Vice-President GrimkÃ©. The last board meeting
of the year, in late November 1913, was a climax of frustrations. The
more Du Bois and Villard grew to detest each other, the more their
movements became like two boxers elaborately squaring off for a
murderous pounding.

Du Bois had prepared for the bout, meeting beforehand with Ovington and
the Spingarn brothers to win their support for his own three-point plan
to restructure the association. [Crisis]{.epub-i} circulation figures
were on a hard rise, in part due to the 18,000 ""human souls"" Du Bois
claimed to have addressed in thirty states during the year. By early
1914, still increasing, [The Crisis]{.epub-i} would reach 33,000
subscribers. Because the editor's salary and travel expenses were
charged to the NAACP, Villard maintained that a thriving
[Crisis]{.epub-i} was largely the result of its connection with the
association, while Du Bois dismissed this as an accountant's quibble.
Under the first of his three points, then, the association and the
magazine would sever their ties completely. Du Bois proposed to make
[The Crisis]{.epub-i} his own instrument just as Villard was about to
make the revitalized [Nation]{.epub-i} his. If the board refused, then
the editor recommended (in his second point) making Ovington chairwoman,
hiring a young African-American as executive secretary, and placing
himself under salaried contract to the NAACP as the editor of [The
Crisis.]{.epub-i} Such a contract, presumably, would impose few
editorial restrictions.

The third alternative, which Du Bois claimed he least preferred, would
merge the office of secretary with that of director of publicity and
research. With the likely departure of Villard, to be replaced either by
Ovington or Joel Spingarn, this arrangement would give him effective
control of the association, a goal he now secretly harbored. That
prospect ""nearly made a wreck of me and almost caused a riot in my
family,"" Nerney gasped to GrimkÃ©. For Villard, the stark choice was the
NAACP or Du Bois. Things had come to such a pass, he informed the board,
that he could ""no longer conscientiously remain as Chairman of the
Board, without having the function of that position more clearly
defined.""[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-15){#cha-15} Dill had
""directly refused to obey official instructions"" and the public was
being misled into believing that an entirely out-of-control magazine
spoke for the multiple goals and programs of a national organization.
The situation was intolerable, Villard continued; Du Bois's title ought
to be changed to editor of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} and the magazine and
staff severed from the association. The chair-man's proposal would save
the NAACP more than three thousand dollars in [Crisis]{.epub-i} salaries
and expenditures, and, as intended, it called Du Bois's bluff on the
issue of running the magazine by himself.

The board stretched to keep both men in its embrace, principally relying
on Ovington and Joel Spingarn to encourage tact in Du Bois and
magnanimity from Villard. A certain affinity of temperament drew Du Bois
and Spingarn together, a New England kinship of patrician combativeness
and superior culture. Gracious and generous toward their few intimates,
both men projected a frosty elegance in public and professional
settings. Fluent in languages, a master teacher and internationally read
author, disciple of Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce, and founder
himself of the American school of New Criticism in literature, Spingarn,
like the editor of [The Crisis,]{.epub-i} was contemptuous of
compromise. When Nicholas Butler, Columbia's headstrong, autocratic
president, dismissed without due process a prominent professor accused
of an extramarital affair in 1911, threatening what little remained of
faculty rights, Spingarn had spoken out, resigned in protest, and in the
serenity of Troutbeck, his Hudson River estate, composed ""Heloise sans
Abelard,"" a famously mocking poem about the travesty.

[O passionate Heloise,]{.epub-i}

[I too have lived under the ban,]{.epub-i}

[With seven hundred professors,]{.epub-i}

[And not a single
man.]{.epub-i}[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-16){#cha-16}

While Du Bois weighed the counsel of someone he considered to be his
intellectual near-equal, Villard pondered the full implications of
Ovington's letter about his own resignation as chairman. ""To you it
means just Dr. Du Bois and Mr. Dill,"" she warned, ""but to me it means a
confession to the world that we cannot work with colored people unless
they are our subordinates."" Did he really wish to set an example by
which ""everyone who believes in segregation will become a little more
firmly convinced that he is
right?""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-17){#cha-17} By giving
neither man complete satisfaction, the board hoped to make room for
their monumental egos. Villard had the satisfaction of seeing Du Bois's
bid for the secretaryship, along with other alternatives in his
three-point plan, rejected. Du Bois was consoled by the vote to defer
any further enhancement of the powers of the chairman and by Dill's
retention. On balance, however, the editor emerged in a slightly
stronger position vis-Ã -vis his chief critic, which had the effect of
transforming the intolerable into the humiliating, from Villard's point
of view. With Nerney indicating her lack of support, Ovington ever
faithful to his adversary, and Walling alarmed that Du Bois might
resign, Villard decided to step down, rightly suspecting that he was
about to be stripped of authority. The threatened November resignation
became a fact at the end of the year. Joel Spingarn, whose boardroom
manners were more pleasing all around, became chairman while Villard,
explaining to Ovington that, ""quite aside from the question of Dr. Du
Bois,"" his other affairs had begun to suffer, assumed the post of
treasurer. Shortly thereafter, and much to Villard's relief, the
association moved to 70 Fifth Avenue, where the editor arranged for more
expensive space (\$108 per month, twice the cost of the Vesey Street
office) than the unconsulted new chairman had anticipated. Villard would
remain unshakably convinced that [The Crisis]{.epub-i} was ""never going
to do the service or have the influence it ought to until it had another
editor.""[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-18){#cha-18}

The new [Crisis]{.epub-i} quarters at 70 Fifth Avenue hummed. The
building, a tall white one owned by Ginn and Company, publishers, was
larger than Villard's, equipped with more elevators, and, Du Bois wrote
John Hope, more ""light and air. Do drop in."" Behind a large, heavy, dark
wooden desk, an immaculate, waistcoated Du Bois read copy and
correspondence into a Dictaphone whose wax cylinders he regularly shaved
and recycled. The self-important Dill put his talents, Harvard-honed in
sociology, to accounts and editorial work (replacing Frank M. Turner,
the tall, sharp-featured circulation manager whom the magazine had had
to share with the NAACP); and Albon L. Holsey, the round-faced,
cross-looking little advertising manager, demonstrated the high-level
dedication that the editor expected of him. There was now space for a
large safe as well as a new, electric multigraph machine that saved up
to fifty dollars monthly in printing costs. Various secretarial duties
were discharged by Misses Allison, Jarvis, and Sousa, all of whom looked
more southern European than the attractive, presumably competent,
African-Americans they were. The total staff rose to eight not long
after the move from Vesey Street, leading Nerney to begin referring to
Du Bois's ""personal machine."" It was all wrong, she wrote GrimkÃ©.
""People were employed because of personal devotion to him, and retained
for that reason.""[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-19){#cha-19} To
Du Bois, Nerney's concerns---although well-meaning---seemed as misguided
as Villard's.

But putting distance between the editor of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} and the
master of [The Nation]{.epub-i} left fundamental problems unresolved.
The root cause of the NAACP's troubles was its split personality, its
institutional uncertainty as to what its primary mission should be.
Because progressive white people had founded it, the organization was
inclined to proceed in its litigation, lobbying, and propaganda efforts
in a phased and deliberate manner, mindful of the racial prejudices and
stereotypes harbored by the majority of Americans, and of what they
themselves often perceived as the unfortunate yet understandable reasons
behind such prejudices and stereotypes. More than half the association's
annual budget of about \$11,000 came from eighteen white
philanthropists, men and women who believed that, in order to fight
racism, it made sense to deemphasize race, and to whom, therefore, much
of the thunder and lightning in [The Crisis]{.epub-i} seemed dangerously
inflammatory. Jane Addams, Albert Pillsbury, Florence Kelley, and the
tentative Reverend John Holmes, among others, were inclined to agree
that Du Bois failed to hold the scales of justice between the races
""absolutely even by scoring colored wrongdoers precisely as he scores
white offenders."" To Villard, it sometimes seemed that Du Bois
invariably took the side of the colored man against the white man ""and
never stops to ask what the facts are on the other
side.""[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-20){#cha-20}

And running deeper than questions of policy and strategy was the bedrock
of psychology. Villard spoke for what might have been called the
Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment reformers, the privileged white
people who championed the constitutional rights of black people but were
distinctly unsympathetic to aspirations of ""social equality."" At its
crudest, most visceral, social equality meant interracial sex, whether
blessed by marriage vows or not---explicitly, black men possessing white
women. In its sublimated form, social equality meant impertinent
demeanor or expression, intrusion into ""white"" social space, and the
obliteration of all the ""natural"" and necessary economic and
professional hierarchies based on skin color. Du Bois was absolutely
convinced that one of his essays had been rejected by the usually
friendly [Survey]{.epub-i} editor Paul U. Kellogg because of a paragraph
unequivocally calling on the African-American to ""demand his social
rights: His right to be treated as a gentleman, when he acts like one,
to marry any sane, grown person who wants to marry him, and to meet and
eat with his friends without being accused of undue assumption or
unworthy ambition."" As late as 1920, Florence Kelley, bustling and
bristling, would threaten resignation from the board unless the NAACP
dissociated itself from a [Crisis]{.epub-i} editorial in which Du Bois
had explained that social equality was ""just as much a human right as
political or economic
equality.""[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-21){#cha-21}

Thus, with the Old Testament prose of [The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i}
and the jeremiads and Carlylian effulgences of [Crisis]{.epub-i}
editorials, Du Bois sought to transform his people's leadership class
through inspiration, agitation, and even imprecation. ""The jeremiads
were needed to redeem a people,"" he wrote in one [Crisis]{.epub-i}
editorial. Forty years later, the anti-imperialist philosopher Frantz
Fanon would almost certainly have Du Bois in mind when he exhorted the
nonwhites of the world to unite and risk losing nothing but the chains
of their minds. Writing of its cleansing power in [The Wretched of the
Earth,]{.epub-i} this Afro-French psychiatrist from Martinique, whose
ideas would fuel revolutions from Algeria to Cuba, proclaimed that
violence liberated the oppressed ""from his inferiority complex and from
his despair and inaction; it makes him fearless and restores his
self-respect."" For Du Bois, physical violence---assassinations,
conspiracies, barricades---was repugnant in principle and
counterproductive in practice. But the violence of ideas, the insurgency
of attitudes, the rupture of deference, and the constitutional assault
upon oppressive institutions were the essential preconditions of black
racial liberation. It was self-evident to him that had not [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} ""been in a sense a personal organ and the expression of
myself,"" it would never have attained its popularity and
effectiveness.[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-22){#cha-22}

When it was not hurling thunderbolts, [The Crisis]{.epub-i} dripped
acid, issue after issue. Mordant observations and gratuitous asides
filled its pages. Writing about his summer 1913 promotional trip to the
""Great Northwest"" and the warm reception among Seattle's minority
community, the editor remarked that it took ""extraordinary training,
gift and opportunity to make the average white man anything but an
overbearing hog, but the most ordinary Negro is an instinctive
gentleman."" The August issue covering the western trip carried a
full-page photograph of the editor standing with a well-dressed group of
citizens, captioned ""Colored Los Angeles Greets [The Crisis,]{.epub-i}""
once again enraging Villard, who pointed out to the board that the NAACP
had been, as usual, ignored. Theodore Roosevelt's invidious essay in
[The Outlook,]{.epub-i} ""Brazil and the Negro,"" Du Bois deemed barely
worthy of rebuttal. Unable to avoid noticing Brazil's large African and
racially mixed population at the end of his spring 1914 visit, the
globetrotting former president commended the absence of a color bar
there---which Du Bois applauded---but he went on to claim that in the
United States the best men believe ""'in treating each man of whatever
color absolutely on his worth as a man, allowing him full opportunity to
achieve the success warranted by his ability and integrity'""---which Du
Bois heatedly denied. Roosevelt compounded mendacity with insult by
observing that Brazilians regarded the ""Negro element"" in their blood as
a slight weakening. All this was nonsense, the editor fumed, quoting [in
extenso]{.epub-i} Brazilian authorities; but to expect Roosevelt to
write about race relations ""without twistings and equivocation is to
expect the
millennium.""[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-23){#cha-23}

Did the editor really ""imagine that it is the slightest help to our
purpose to denounce Mr. Roosevelt's statement as a 'falsehood'?"" a
distinguished white sympathizer cautioned about such provocation. The
sarcastic [Crisis]{.epub-i} reply was that the African-American ""has
nothing but 'friends' and may the good God deliver him from most of
them, for they are like to lynch his soul."" ""'Don't antagonize, don't be
bitter; say the conciliatory thing; make friends and do not repel them;
insist on and emphasize the cheerful and good and dwell as little as
possible on wrong and evil'""---this was the counsel of those who
expected every African-American to sound like Booker T. Washington. ""But
Mr. Dole's feet \[the white sympathizer\] never walked the ways we
tread. He does not know---he cannot conceive this darker world of
insult, repression, hunger, and murder,"" Du Bois wrote with almost
personal poignancy. ""He and Charles William Eliot and Woodrow Wilson and
millions of others have given no encouragement to lynching except by
silence! [Except by silence!]{.epub-i} EXCEPT BY
SILENCE!""[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-24){#cha-24} From
Calhoun, Georgia, came a subscription check and Jessie E. Guernsey's
grateful letter. Miss Guernsey allowed her name to be published in the
letters column, fearlessly declaring that what improvements there had
been in relations between the races had been due not to patience and
compromise but to ""the constantly increasing number of able, educated,
cultivated men and women of the race whoÂ ... bring a new demand for
recognition and give the question of social justice new prominence and
new meaning."" E. C. Williams, principal of the District of Columbia's M
Street Public High School, found Du Bois's well-phrased pugnacity
admirable. It improved with age, Williams wrote, ""and it alone justifies
the existence of the NAACP,"" a view that most African-Americans
shared.[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-25){#cha-25}

For the association's white conservatives, as well as for a few old
Niagarites like Archibald GrimkÃ© and Butler Wilson, this galloping
tendency to regard Du Bois as the personification of the movement was
the height of poor judgment. When all-white Johns Hopkins University
rejected the application of a qualified African-American high school
graduate, Du Bois passed over the dean's barely plausible explanations
to blast the university's hypocrisy---another occasion for Villard to
protest [The Crisis]{.epub-i} going off ""half cocked on this as it had
so many other things."" The collapse of a dogged vocational experiment of
his friend Will Benson, the handsome dreamer from Kowaliga, Alabama,
brought an impassioned May 1915 editorial indicting flabby white
philanthropists for taking their cues from a silent, hostile Booker
Washington. Villard, who was marginally involved in Kowaliga, was
furious again. Fine white men who let Benson have ""too free a reign""
were being defamed for trying to uplift a needy people. ""Simply
incredible. It is treason to the race,"" he fumed to Joel
Spingarn.[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-26){#cha-26}

Even Ovington winced occasionally over her hero's editorials, finally
taking a deep breath to advise from the family building at 246 Fulton
Street that she had begun to feel ""there was something the matter with
[The Crisis]{.epub-i} from the viewpoint of its white readers."" With the
greatest delicacy, she wrote that she did wonder if, in his own way, Du
Bois was not sometimes as abrasive as Villard. Must he really offend
white readers ""by saying that they are reactionary heathen"" and
constantly make them feel that they were insulting him ""when they have
no insult in their heart?"" Ovington closed by asking if the association
were not a ""work for colored and white people to do together,"" or was it
instead ""a work of revolution for the colored people only?... Should we
preach race consciousness just as the socialist preaches class
consciousness...?"" From a well-earned, active retirement, Horace
Bumstead also felt compelled to give his erstwhile subordinate a
""scolding."" For some months past, the former Atlanta University
president had been ""disturbed"" over the conduct of [The
Crisis.]{.epub-i} He was finding ""it hard to defend \[Du Bois\] with
friends who come to me with complaints."" There had been an attack on the
Episcopal Church, a savage personal attack on the editor of [The
Congregationalist,]{.epub-i} and, most troubling of all, Du Bois had
ignored Trotter's ""unexcelled"" plain speaking to President Wilson. ""Is
there something demoralizing in an editor's chair,"" the old abolitionist
asked the scholar who had made Atlanta University world famous. Lamely
explaining again that a deadline and subsequent editorial slip had kept
Trotter out of the magazine, Du Bois replied that it still seemed to him
that Episcopalians were ""a little ahead"" when it came to
sin.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-27){#cha-27}

Like the Jacobin followers of Danton during the French Revolution, civil
rights-conscious African-Americans expected audacity above all from Du
Bois, his magazine, and his organization. By 1919, when the
contributions of more than 62,000 members, the great majority of them
black, would make up most of its \$44,000 operating budget, Du Bois's
vision of the civil rights struggle in America as the driving wedge in
the global empowerment of darker peoples would find greater resonance in
the association's program. To this end, organizational requirements,
matters of budget and agenda, the sensitivities of fellow officers,
additional personnel to build branches, and even scarce resources needed
to haul malefactors before the courts, were secondary. Villard and his
kind, Du Bois knew, could never fully understand that if black people in
America did not build their own regiments and raise up their own
colonels and generals, then both the plan of battle and the terms of the
armistice would be compromised. He would see the contest with Villard in
Zeitgeistian terms in the [Autobiography,]{.epub-i} writing that it
might be understood ""as a matter of the actions and thoughts of certain
men, or as a development of larger social forces beyond personal
control."" He supposed the latter aspect ""is the
truer.""[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-28){#cha-28}

Meanwhile, the struggle over the organizational direction raged
throughout 1914 and 1915. April 1914 was especially rancorous. In his
new post as treasurer, Villard now insisted that all departments,
including that of the director of publicity and research, submit their
books for line-item scrutiny. It was the only way, he insisted, that
economies and lines of authority essential to the association's
effectiveness could be enforced. At the strained board meeting on April
7, Du Bois icily demurred when Joel Spingarn invited comments on the
proposed restructuring of the association. Simply unacceptable, he
declared, brushing aside the treasurer's spluttering objections and
forcing the matter to the table. It was obvious to all that a test of
wills was at hand. ""Vexed"" at Spingarn for failing to call the editor on
what he decried as the ""outrageous assault"" on his dignity, Villard
raged that Du Bois ""show\[ed\] himself in his true colors. What a pity
that he was never house-broken."" One more such contretemps, Villard
continued, and he would ""be through."" Du Bois was telling Ovington the
same thing in a long letter two days later. They had come to a parting
of the ways. Probably it was better ""to fight the matter out now"" on the
issue of whether the NAACP was to stand on its ""original radical
platform or is to go that way of conservative compromise which turned
the Ogden movement, the Southern Education Board and the General
Education Board so completely from their original purpose."" This new
reorganization plan aimed to put him and [The Crisis]{.epub-i} ""under
the immediate charge"" of Villard; it barred ""all real initiative""; and
its adoption would be tantamount ""to a vote or lack of confidence and
\[he\] should immediately resign \[his\] position."" ""No other executive
officer is thus humiliated,"" he maintained, ignoring the fact that he
was the only executive officer who wore two hats. He knew what Villard
was up to. ""He opposed my coming to the position in the first
place.""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-29){#cha-29}

Du Bois clearly intended to get rid of his nemesis. For his part,
Villard made it plain that what had eluded him as the board's chief
officer he was now determined to enforce through vouchers and audits.
Minutes of board meetings during this period reflect Du Bois's dogged
determination to have his way, to save the association, as he believed,
by wrenching it from the groove into which Villard had forced it. ""Each
member of the Board is urged to be present and to express his opinion on
this very important matter,"" read a late-March notice about a new Du
Bois scheme to reduce the treasurer's duties to fund-raising, transfer
chairman Spingarn's powers to a new executive committee, and make [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} the exclusive province of its editor. Du Bois had what
must have been an especially candid talk that March with Spingarn to win
his support. The following day, he received a diplomatic reassurance
that Spingarn's ""criticism was not offered in the spirit of
fault-finding but (as friend's criticism should always be) was given for
no other purpose than that of
helping.""[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-30){#cha-30} Hoping to
defuse the explosive overhaul proposal, Spingarn, Ovington, Brooks,
Milholland, Sinclair, and others succeeded in deferring action at three
roiling April meetings until a special subcommittee headed by Studin
could propose new bylaws at a meeting in June or July. But while
Spingarn went to Louisville, Kentucky, to organize the local branch's
protest of the city's recent residential segregation ordinance, civil
war erupted in the association.

The plan to vest the board's powers in a new executive committee had
originated with Nerney. Like Du Bois, she sensed growing conservative
tendencies in the astonishing new recommendation by the committee
impaneled to award the association's new Spingarn Medal to Hampton
Institute administrator Robert Russa Moton. The forceful secretary
helped scotch the bestowal of the medal on the coming leader of the
Bookerites. The first Spingarn Medal would go instead to Dartmouth
alumnus Ernest Everett Just, a young cytologist and Howard University
professor. But Nerney's reorganization plan would have put Spingarn,
herself, and GrimkÃ© on the new executive committee. After the board
dawdled, Du Bois aggressively reintroduced her plan as his own with
himself in a starring role. If protecting his monopoly over [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} meant that he must take over the running of the NAACP,
Du Bois was finally prepared to do so. To Nerney and GrimkÃ©, he seemed
clearly bent on usurping the association. Even the funds for the legal
campaign against the grandfather clause in Oklahoma and the spread of
residential segregation were diverted to [The Crisis.]{.epub-i} His
department of publicity and research went ""gaily on expanding merrily
while the NAACP is forced to retrench and retrench,"" Nerney charged with
only slight
exaggeration.[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-31){#cha-31}

Despite the alleged budget constraints, 1915 was to be a banner year for
the NAACP's embryonic legal department. Although he elected not to
appear before the Supreme Court himself, Storey's brief on the
unconstitutionality of the Oklahoma grandfather clause was accepted as
an [amicus curiae]{.epub-i} (friend of the court) argument in [Guinn v.
United States.]{.epub-i} Oklahoma's preferential registration of white
voters was unanimously struck down, with Chief Justice Edward D. White,
ex-Confederate and Bourbon Redeemer, writing the first opinion to
nullify a state law under the Fifteenth Amendment in forty-five years.
Still, Villard became more acerbic and Nerney continued to storm and
threaten, provoking an annoyed Du Bois's accusation that, although the
secretary hadn't ""an ounce of conscious prejudice,... her every step is
unconsciously along the color
line.""[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-32){#cha-32} It was, in the
end, a question of two incommensurable perspectives. Fifteen years
later, Villard would entitle a book about his visit to the Soviet Union
[Russia from a Car Window.]{.epub-i} A book about his civil rights
perspective might have been called [Race Relations from the
Boardroom.]{.epub-i} Ovington above all tried to help him understand.
She knew that they could ""never agree about Du Bois,"" she told Villard
during one of her numerous unsuccessful attempts to make him see the
world through the eyes of a black man. ""He does do dangerous things. He
strikes out at people with a harshness and directness that appalls me,""
she admitted, ""but the blow is often deserved and it is never below the
belt.""[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-33){#cha-33} Du Bois's
perspective was that of his beleaguered people who were deprived of the
ballot and lynched in the South, shut out of labor unions and socially
ostracized in the North, taxed to pay for public education systems that
excluded them. It was one in which the virtues of patience and
objectivity seemed as dubiously beneficial to him as to Native Americans
on reservations or Zulu farmers in South Africa.

The anxiously awaited July 1914 meeting of the board resulted in sharper
varsity combat between the editor and the treasurer, with victory going
to the editor. Although the new bylaws, investing the chairman with full
executive authority and the treasurer with audit powers over all the
association's departments, were approved, Du Bois demanded a vote
effectively nullifying them. Under Du Bois's proposal, full powers would
be vested in a new executive committee, each of its four
members---chairman, treasurer, editor, and secretary---equal in power:
""The Executive Committee shall meet as often as necessary and shall have
general supervision over the work of theÂ ... Association and all the
departments thereof""---and it was obvious that, under this plan, board
meetings would decrease and executive meetings would increase. Spingarn
was left to run the association; Du Bois reigned at [The
Crisis.]{.epub-i} Florence Kelley joined Villard in outraged objection,
but the majority, having just reasserted dominion over [The
Crisis,]{.epub-i} blinked and reversed itself, giving Du Bois exactly
what he wanted---impunity to run his department through an executive
quartet in which no member had more power than the others. At long last,
correct principles and respectful authority seemed to mesh, Du Bois
wanted to believe---""two branches of the same work, one with a white
head and one with a colored; working in harmony and sympathy for one
end.""[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-34){#cha-34} Everything about
Joel Spingarn presaged actual collaboration. From the moment Du Bois had
seconded Spingarn's nomination to the board, the two intellectuals had
grown closer personally and in organizational understanding. The editor
saw himself finally being left alone to fight racism from the pages of
[The Crisis]{.epub-i} while the new chairman, seconded by an admiring
Ovington, kept Villard and Nerney in check, on the one hand, and did all
he could, on the other, to put association resources behind the editor.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[FREQUENTLY CHARACTERIZING]{.epub-sc} their mission as the ""New
Abolitionism"" (there had been a notable public tiff with Villard when
Spingarn claimed that William Lloyd Garrison would never have advocated
meekness), Spingarn spoke Du Bois's language. Shortly after joining the
board, Spingarn had begun tireless, annual travels north, south, and
west across the country, first as chair of the branches committee then
as board chair, in order to explain the NAACP and drum up support among
white people as well as black. He had little of the gregariousness of
his younger brother Arthur. With his gleaming black hair, long, dark
face, and intense eyes that drew men and women into his discourse,
Spingarn propagated the faith on black and white college campuses, in
churches of every denomination, men's and women's clubs of high and low
social standing---everywhere and among anyone to whom the new
abolitionism (immediate winning of civil rights for African-Americans)
brought confidence and commitment. Ovington had always understood that,
in order to build mass support, the NAACP had to be seen as a crusading
force increasingly guided by African-Americans themselves. If Villard
ever grasped this, he was temperamentally incapable of conveying any
urgent commitment to such a goal. Joel Spingarn understood, believed,
and had the requisite fire and flair. With his ascent to the
chairmanship, the Bookerite tendencies in the association decidedly
waned. He had told a group of African-Americans shortly after joining
the board that he was ""tired, too, of the philanthropy of rich white men
toward your race."" He wanted black people to ""fight your own battles
with your own leaders and your own
money.""[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-35){#cha-35}

There were times when Villard was almost as uneasy about the former
professor's ideas as about the editor's. Had Spingarn's civil rights
radicalism been matched by economic radicalism, Villard would probably
have bailed out the NAACP altogether, and Du Bois's evolving socialism
very likely would have speeded up. But when it came to property rights,
income distribution, and government regulation of business, Joel
Spingarn was much more cautious than his hero Teddy Roosevelt. His
biographer, B. Joyce Ross, called him an ""economic liberal""---that is,
not very liberal at all. His words, she wrote, were to be ""more
provocative than his actions throughout his career in the
NAACP.""[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-36){#cha-36} The words of
this humanist, whose austere elegance and lofty eloquence evoked the
image of some scholar prince of the Renaissance wandered into the
twentieth century, stirred Du Bois deeply. ""I do not think that any
other white man ever touched me emotionally so closely,"" was Du Bois's
astonishing verdict on their courtly, contentious friendship. He added
that he was ""both fascinated and antagonized by some of his quick and
positive judgments."" Their affinity was as intense as the
misunderstandings between them were analytically merciless. For almost
three years, however, Du Bois and Spingarn worked together almost
without friction. The similarity in temperament and civil rights optic
was strikingly evident during their trip together to Memphis in 1914 to
protest the exclusion of African-American delegates to a national
conference of charitable organizations. Instead of quietly buttonholing
key officers or submitting petitions to the appropriate committees,
Spingarn and Du Bois hired a local hall and placed a full-page statement
in the Memphis [Commercial Appeal]{.epub-i}---""All Those Who Love Truth
and Dare Hear It Are Cordially
Invited.""[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-37){#cha-37}

[The Crisis]{.epub-i} gave generous coverage to Spingarn's speaking
tours. ""NAACP Notes"" for March 1915 reported, ""This tour, like the one a
year ago, resulted in the widest publicity in the white as well as the
colored press."" The chairman's progress from Chicago to Topeka had been
a triumph. After a hard-hitting speech at Chicago's Lincoln Center,
Spingarn was warned by wealthy young Roger N. Baldwin (Villard's private
school classmate and nephew of William) that he would not be allowed to
address the City Club of St. Louis unless he tamed his withering
references to Booker Washington. Informing the future head of the
American Civil Liberties Union that he would rather withdraw than limit
his freedom of speech, Spingarn (tailed by Baldwin) proceeded to give a
somewhat modulated speech to the St. Louis club. A fascinating sidelight
on the racial preconceptions of the times turns up in his letter to Amy
Einstein, his artistic, southern-born wife, after the St. Louis City
Club talk: a local reporter had wanted to know ""insolently (or perhaps
merely in ignorance) whether I was a
Negro.""[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-38){#cha-38}

Spingarn's magnetism pulled in a wide variety of people. Students in
Fisk University's Cravath Memorial Chapel were stirred, and they, in
turn, deeply stirred Spingarn. Reporting to Amy of that April 1912
epiphany, Joel said that he had risen to tell them ""to be strong and
wise and good, not for their sakes but for my country's, which could not
fulfill my vision of its ideal beauty and justice unless they were wise
and good and strong."" He wrote Amy of his utter agony at having to abide
by the etiquette of Jim Crow on a sleeper heading for Memphis in which
it had been necessary to talk separately to a noted white southern
educator, James Hardy Dillard (""almost ashamed of some of the
half-measures he himself is obliged to support"") and a distinguished
African-American professor at Howard University, ""unless I wanted to
embarrass Dillard and his work."" Lunch in Atlanta with Du Bois's best
friend, John Hope, left him with the ethnocentric thought that the
Morehouse president was a man ""absolutely indistinguishable in looks,
culture, instinct, or temperament from an educated white man, and a very
fine one at that.""[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-39){#cha-39}

As he moved among black people, perhaps because of his own people's
historic troubles, Spingarn's observations were generally distinguished
by nuance, depth, minimal preconception, and broad understanding. ""I
have seen the negro do almost everything,"" he wrote Amy from the South
in 1912---""perform a surgical operation, fill teeth, print 300,000
copies of a pamphlet in his own printing plant, work in the factories of
the white man, teach and learn, and (at the other end of life) sink to
the level of yielding to the white man's pleasure, and you will want to
hear these things when I get back to town, but not now."" Spingarn, the
supremely assimilated Austrian Jew, also keenly observed other Jews in
his travels, writing Amy from Kansas City in a somewhat superior tone
about the well-known lawyer and civic reformer Jacob Billikopf, of
Russian origins. Related by marriage to one of New York's most
influential Jewish families, future NAACP board member Billikopf,
""despite every alien touch of speech and feature, has won for himself a
real place in the civic life of a whole
city.""[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-40){#cha-40}

Later, in a reflective mood, Du Bois spoke of his friend as one of those
""vivid, enthusiastic but clear-thinking idealists which from age to age
the Jewish race has given the world."" Yet Joel Spingarn presented
himself to the world, and to the association, as an upper-class
unhyphenated American, of formidable humanist culture, and only then,
and incidentally, as a Jew. Insofar as he allowed his motives for
devotion to the NAACP to be fathomed, he explained them in terms of a
sense of justice and a void stemming from his splendid exit from
academe. His consternation upon reading of the barbarous treatment of
the Arkansas farmer Steve Greene, extradited from Chicago, had indeed
impelled him to volunteer his services to Villard, Ovington, and Du
Bois. The fact that he was Jewish was, nonetheless, certainly not
irrelevant. In the valuable collection of essays edited by Charles
Herbert Stember, [Jews in the Mind of America]{.epub-i} (1966), one
contributor's observation that, ""as history has shown only too often,
any serious strain in a society may become a threat to Jews,"" suggests
the motive behind Spingarn's
motives.[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-41){#cha-41} The ""race
problem"" in Spingarn's America---its lynchings, disfranchisings,
economic exclusions, educational deprivations, and social
stigmas---remained overwhelmingly a ""Negro"" problem, but, as it spread
from the South in a period of great influx from eastern Europe and of
deepening industrial unrest, antagonism against African-Americans would
inevitably spawn a contagion infecting even those Jews with deep roots
in the republic.

Spingarn's presence in the NAACP coincided roughly with the arrival of
Jewish philanthropy in Afro-America, with Jacob Schiff's Tuskegee
beneficence, Sears, Roebuck and Company president Julius Rosenwald's
funding of a good part of the South's black public school buildings, and
Benjamin Altman and Dorothy Straus's support of the National Urban
League. The tradition of giving was ancient in the Jewish community,
commanded by scripture and strengthened by adversities in times and
places near and remote. One of the nation's leading constitutional
lawyers, Louis Marshall, a founder of the American Jewish Committee and
president of New York's Temple Emanu-El, had warned the men and women of
his circle that they would cut a ""sorry figure"" indeed by not denouncing
racial discrimination against black people in America as they lifted
their voices against pogroms in Russia. Moreover, on the authority of
the founder of modern Zionism himself, a vague affinity between Jews and
transplanted Africans was said to exist. A character in
[Altneuland,]{.epub-i} The-odor Herzl's 1903 novel, proclaimed, ""The
depths of that problem in all their horror, only a Jew can fathom. I
mean the Negro
problem.""[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-42){#cha-42}

Second-nature generosity received further incentive through
status-enhancing collaboration with Carnegie and Rockefeller
benefactions. Great Jewish fortunes began supplementing the older,
Protestant charities by the close of the first decade of the century,
encouraged by Gentile veterans of ""Negro uplift"" grateful for their
millions and who hinted at future quid pro quo in boardrooms and
clubhouses. Almost from the moment of its creation, increasing Jewish
interest in the NAACP had come with the ceremonial or actual involvement
among others of Henry Moskowitz, Lillian Wald, Edwin Seligman, Jacob
Mack, and Rabbi Stephen Wise. Voted at the 1910 National Negro
Conference, the so-called Russian Resolution condemning the
government-sponsored pogrom and renewed expulsion of Jews from Kiev had
been applauded and was undoubtedly a factor in Jacob Schiff's annual
donations through Du Bois during the association's early years. Genuine
compassion combined with sage self-interest, therefore, to prompt many
Uptown Jews to begin monitoring the evolving social welfare and civil
rights status of
African-Americans.[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-43){#cha-43}

Anti-Semitism was not something Spingarn was inclined to discuss
publicly. Even within his circle, anti-Semitism was talked about
obliquely and guardedly, although it had been festering and spreading in
America since the late 1800s. Yet alert and influential Jews were
uneasy. Clubs in which their membership had once been accepted, like New
York's prestigious Union League (with Jews among its founders), now
excluded them. University trusteeships were closing to them, even at
Columbia where, as long ago as the 1780s, the learned Rabbi Sheareth
Israel had sat among the college's
benefactors.[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-44){#cha-44} Still,
notwithstanding the paranoid style in populism, prejudice against Jews
had remained diffuse in America until the onset of the twentieth
century. Jewish faith in the American creed of merit and mobility
remained unshaken. The Uptown Jews deemed their robust commercial
establishments, powerful financial institutions, and majestic reform
temples, as well as their splendid contributions to science, law, and
the humanities, to be sturdy rungs to the commanding heights of national
status and influence. Interviewed in the same city where five years
later he would dramatically reverse himself on Zionism, Louis Brandeis
summed up the attitude of these assimilationists in 1910, telling a
reporter from Boston's [Jewish Advocate,]{.epub-i} ""Habits of living or
of thought which tend to keep alive difference of origin or classify men
according to their beliefs are inconsistent with the American ideal of
brotherhood, and are
disloyal.""[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-45){#cha-45}

There was something of paradox, and of dilemma, then, in their quest for
high standing among the Gentile rich and powerful, because what Spingarn
and his class really desired was eventually to win recognition [as
Jews]{.epub-i} by leading superlative public lives no different in
appearance, customs, and values from those of wealthy Protestant, and
largely Republican, Americans. Schiff's ""confidential"" note to Villard
when department-store millionaire and civic benefactor Benjamin Altman
died in the fall of 1914 captured the paradox perfectly. Could not
Villard have the [Evening Post]{.epub-i} present this life as a fine
object lesson to the million or so Jewish people in New York, suggested
Schiff, since no newspaper had mentioned that Alt-man ""has lived and
died as a Jew. When a Jew does any wrong haste is only too frequently
made to emphasize the fact that it was a Jew who has done it,"" the great
banker reminded Villard. ""Everybody knows that he was a Jew,"" the blunt
publisher replied, managing in the same breath both to affirm and
dismiss the significance of Altman's Jewishness. ""To draw attention to
the fact wouldÂ ... rather diminish than increase the moral effect of
that knowledge.""[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-46){#cha-46}

In the recent past, Spingarn and his class had seen the new virulence as
largely centered in the lower classes and aimed mainly at the hundreds
of thousands of inrushing poor from Russia, Poland, and the Balkans, who
were almost as exotic and vexatious to them as to the Anglo-Saxon
Protestant families whose social respect had been so successfully
cultivated. But now the so-called Uptown Jews---the Altmans,
Guggenheims, Lehmans, Schiffs, Seligmans, Sulzbergers, and other wealthy
Ashkenazic families whose ancestors had come to the United States during
the long German migration from 1830 to 1880---began to see the 1.5
million Jewish newcomers streaming through Ellis Island after 1896 as
the source of growing misunderstanding and hostility. Conditions were
ripe for a scapegoating that could well make the genteel discrimination
of the last few decades seem benign and trivial. That many influential
Jews began to feel ambivalent and vaguely unsure was scarcely surprising
in a time when a successful Atlanta Jewish businessman of upstanding
Confederate pedigree, Leo Frank, could be convicted in 1913 of raping
little Mary Phagan, a white employee, on the testimony of a black
janitor. An American Dreyfus Affair in the making, the case was cut
short two years later when a redneck mob, riled up by the fallen
Populist leader Tom Watson, lynched Leo Frank in the Marietta, Georgia,
town square a few days after the governor commuted his death
sentence.[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-47){#cha-47} After 1900
(with all the influx portended for Spingarn and Samuel Gompers), three
out of every four Jewish immigrants to America came from the Russian
pale. As they streamed past Emma Lazarus's inscription beckoning the
huddled masses, Jewish commentators in Lower East Side union halls as
well as Uptown mansions drew closer parallels between these immigrants
and black people---peoples of two diasporas. Abraham Cahan, the editor
of the Socialist [Jewish Daily Forward,]{.epub-i} would find an exact
one in the East St. Louis race riot of 1917 and the Kishinev pogrom of
1903.[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-48){#cha-48} Increasingly
after 1910, philanthropy and civil rights in Afro-America attracted
sustained Jewish participation.

Joel Spingarn kept up his scholarly interests, producing anthologies and
works of criticism. He played a major part in founding the publishing
house of Harcourt, Brace in 1914. But until he left for military service
after America entered the Great War, what most often and urgently took
him away from Troutbeck, his fine country estate in Dutchess County, New
York, was service to the NAACP. Arthur, his less-glamorous brother, had
already begun to replace Storey as the association's chief legal
advisor. As the influence of the Spingarns grew, Du Bois's interaction
with them became more crucial to the evolution of the NAACP than ever
before. The July reorganization vote having gone his way, he thought the
lines of authority between the NAACP and [The Crisis]{.epub-i} were more
or less permanently disentangled. The splitting of the association's
authority among Spingarn, Villard, Nerney, and himself was deemed by Du
Bois as much superior to any unitary and hierarchical arrangement. The
overall financial health and circulation figures of his magazine were
robust. While the new legal department slowly prepared its briefs for
cases that could be resolved only one case at a time and after long
intervals, his magazine gave monthly encouragement to the race and
monthly heartburn to hypocrites and racists. [The Crisis]{.epub-i} had
nearly forty thousand monthly readers, and Du Bois remitted half of the
one-dollar annual subscription to the association's treasury, potent
mitigation of Villard's reproaches. Another of the immensely popular,
special children's numbers was scheduled for October 1914, and the
following month's issue would carry ""World War and the Color Line,"" one
of the most perceptive editorials Du Bois ever
wrote.[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-49){#cha-49}

Du Bois had supposed the chairman understood that shortsighted economies
would merely stifle the magazine's growth. Indeed, the extra rental
expenditure at 70 Fifth Avenue was actually ""an illusion,"" if all the
cost benefits were computed. Du Bois considered his own
two-thousand-dollar yearly salary, together with the underwriting of the
office space, as not one cent less than his due. Tending to the souls of
black folk was not a business of budgets but an apostolic concern in
which he knew himself to be an anointed healer. Yet there was Spingarn's
September 1914 memorandum stating that the chairman had ""always felt
that [The Crisis]{.epub-i} was rather extravagant in this matter."" Had
he misjudged the new chairman, after all? [The Crisis]{.epub-i} was
still evolving. ""It can be one of the great journals of the world,"" Du
Bois told Spingarn. It was all very simple, and Spingarn ought to see
that: what he was working for was ""to make the NAACP
[possible.]{.epub-i} Today it is [not]{.epub-i} possible."" But when he
wrote this late-October plea, Du Bois and Spingarn had already clashed
over the latter's public insistence that the editor give more time to
association matters and that the magazine do a more conscientious job of
broadcasting them. Du Bois would have liked to, but the labor of
assembling [The Crisis]{.epub-i} was intense and unforgiving, frequently
keeping him away not only from the routine business of the NAACP but
from urgent policy decisions as well. Deadlines could stall contact with
the outside world. Butler Wilson, down from Boston for a board meeting,
was once curtly turned away from the magazine's offices by a secretary.
Apologizing after a fashion, Du Bois explained that his staff had been
instructed to protect him ""against agents and casual
inquiries.""[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-50){#cha-50} Then there
were numerous speaking engagements drawing him away, and think pieces in
other publications.

Although in sympathy with the editor's special requirements, the
chairman lost his patience in late 1914. The association's revenues were
dropping because of a general economic downturn in the country. Spingarn
expected all departments to accept retrenchment. His long October 24
letter to Du Bois (one of the most remarkable in the latter's enormous
correspondence) combined psychoanalysis with schoolmasterly admonition.
Not until Yolande's piercing Bedales cry from the heart a year later was
Du Bois so bluntly spoken to. The letter begs extended quotation. He
would be frank, Spingarn warned---""so frank that I may wound your
feelings deeply, but at this critical juncture I cannot waive a friend's
right to the frankest criticism."" Never for a moment had he doubted Du
Bois's honesty:

I do think, however, that like Roosevelt and other men I know and
admire, you have an extraordinary unwillingness to acknowledge that you
have made a mistake, even in trifles, and if accused of one, your mind
will find or even invent reasons and quibbles of any kind to prove that
you were never mistaken. The rent of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} office is a
case in point....

This, however, is only a trifle.... Surrounding you always, I may say
frankly, I have found an atmosphere of antagonism. It is not merely Mr.
Villard and Miss Nerney and the Board generally; it is in the whole
colored world, and even some of your most intimate friends feel toward
you a mingled affection and resentment. I realized from the outset that
this was in part due to a devotion to principle, and the sacrifice that
such devotion must always entail.... I realized too (it was your boast)
that you could never accept even the appearance of ""inferiority"" or
""subserviency"" without treason to the race ideals for which you fight,
although in this matter it may be weakness rather than manliness to
protest too much. On the other hand, I found on the part of others, even
those who sympathized with your ideas as much as I did, a conviction
that the ideals which they shared with you had nothing to do with the
cause of their disagreement with your actions and your methods.... They
have come to feel that you prefer to have your own way rather than
accept another way even when no sacrifice of principle is involved. They
have come to feel that you are in fact ready to erect a personal
difference into a question of principle....

Whenever I have come to talk over such matters with you,... I found that
I could not act toward you as I would toward other co-operators in a
great cause. You had to be approached with care and diplomacy, and made
to do things by wheedling and questioning, as children are induced to do
them....

Now I shall not hide from you the fact that many people whose devotion
to this cause is as deep as yours or mine feel that the time has come to
put an end to this tragic trifling. They are at last willing, indeed
anxious, to ""create a scene."" They think you are the chief if not the
only source of the disorder and lack of unity in our
organization.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-51){#cha-51}

Mary Ovington had told Du Bois just a few weeks earlier, when he sought
her advice, that key board members had finally decided to ""get rid of
him."" Nerney, she was certain, no longer wanted him ""associated with
us."" Despite Ovington's warning, he had clearly failed to gauge the
danger his single-minded policies and imperious demeanor had created. By
forcing the board to validate his authority at the expense of Villard,
Nerney, Spingarn, GrimkÃ©, and others, in July, after which he did very
little to nurture and maintain it, Du Bois had virtually guaranteed a
gradual rapprochement and counterattack by unhappy association officers.
He had decided it was simply not worth skirmishing day after day with
Nerney, even though he saw that the consequence of yielding was, ""slowly
but surely,"" to be ""elbowed out of all real connection with the general
work."" Villard's disgust and mistrust were notorious, but Du Bois had
not seen that even men like Butler Wilson and that paragon of the
Talented Tenth, Francis Louis Cardozo, Jr., of the Baltimore NAACP
branch, had come to agree with GrimkÃ© that [The Crisis]{.epub-i} was
leaching the life out of the NAACP. To the hard-driving editor, who was
bent on molding the mind of Afro-America, the mission had seemed well in
hand, however, even though there was a significant financial
indebtedness after August due to continued
expansion.[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-52){#cha-52}

Although offended by Spingarn's letter, Du Bois was above all stunned.
The letter he wrote on October 28, one week before a dramatic Wednesday
meeting of the board, appears to have been his longest ever. (Du Bois's
letters were remarkable for consistent economy of expression.) If he did
not bare his soul, he wrote with rare intensity. He admitted that some
of Spingarn's criticism was fair. Yet some, he was sure, ""is not."" But
the spirit of the letter was ""right and that, after all, is the chief
thing."" Before addressing the main charges, though, Du Bois gave his
version of the office-rent dispute, arguing that the efficiencies gained
by spending more for rent were not extravagances but an economy. Laying
that issue to rest, he moved on to the gravamen of Spingarn's letter.
His temperament [was]{.epub-i} ""a difficult one to endure."" Sounding an
uncommon confessional note, he conceded that, given his ""peculiar
education and experiences, it would be miraculous if I came through
normal and unwarped.... But for heaven's sake let me do the work. Do not
hamper and bind and criticize in little matters."" He was not obstinate,
governed by ""personal likes and dislikes."" Throughout his life, however,
his fine plans had been obstructed and spoiled, seldom permitting him to
do the best work of which he was capable. [The Crisis]{.epub-i} was a
moment in a life---his and the African-American's. It was Du Bois's turn
to lecture now:

We can piddle on, we can beat time, we can do a few small obvious
things: but the great blow---the freeing of ten million---and of other
millions whom they pull down---that means power and organization on a
tremendous scale. The men who will fight in these ranks must be educated
and [The Crisis]{.epub-i} can train them: not simply in its words, but
in its manner, its pictures, its conception of life, its subsidiary
enterprises. With a circulation of a hundred thousand we shall have
begun work. Then the real machinery of the NAACP can be perfected. Is
this a plan of disorganization, of hindrance, of lack of cooperation?

What astonished him, Du Bois went on, was Spingarn's charge that his
activities were ""tragic trifling."" Given the problems he had had to
face, did Spingarn ""honestly think that \[he\] would have made fewer
mistakes?""[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-53){#cha-53}

Reviewing the dispute with Villard over reporting African-American crime
in [The Crisis,]{.epub-i} the sharp exchange between Nerney and Dill
during his absence, and the repeated second-guessing and overriding of
his best judgments by Nerney (""because none of my type ever spoke to her
or her friends with authority""), Du Bois invited his friend to step
behind the veil in order to see the authentic character of their joint
enterprise. This collaboration across racial lines was unprecedented.
""No organization like ours ever succeeded in America: either it became a
group of white philanthropists 'helping' the Negro like the Anti-Slavery
Societies; or it became a group of colored folk freezing out their white
co-workers by insolence and distrust."" Spingarn did not even begin to
realize ""the pathos of an organization like ours,"" that ""the real rift
in the lute"" was the insolence and distrust of the color line. He often
listened to the chairman ""quite speechless when you urge easily
cooperation and understanding. You do not realize this because there is
no shadow of the thing in your soul,"" because Spingarn, like Ovington,
was not ""'American.'"" In the real American world, there was a single,
stark reality, Du Bois contended: white authority over black was as
inimical to organizational success as black authority over white. (""I
have seen the experiment \[unsuccessfully\] made a dozen
times."")[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-54){#cha-54} What this
said about the integrationist goals of the NAACP (and implicitly about
his own criticisms of Booker Washington) Du Bois ignored.

In forcing the association to redeem itself, Du Bois explained, he had
sought to make it possible for white and black people to work
[separately]{.epub-i} together in order to work well [together]{.epub-i}
separately---""two branches of the same work, one with a white head
\[Spingarn\] and one with a colored \[himself\]."" But at this point in
the letter, he seemed to become entrapped in self-contradiction, partly
explained by the hurry of composition, but primarily by those unresolved
elements of racial chauvinism and racial egalitarianism in his civil
rights philosophy. Admitting that his separate-but-equal solution for
the association had not worked well---that the ""connecting and unifying
power between the two branches had not been found""---he suggested that
this unifying power ""must eventually be one man."" Yet if Du Bois
believed himself to be that one man (and almost certainly he did), then
what of the bedrock racial incompatibility among civil rights
professionals that had caused him to overturn the powers of the board in
the first place? Whatever the contradictions and misunderstandings (""any
unprejudiced judge would have at least acknowledged the reasonableness
of my stand""), he demanded that the board ""give the man of ability and
integrity the right to make mistakes if the final result is big enough
to justify his
effort.""[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-55){#cha-55} Failing that,
he ended crisply, no ""scene"" would be needed to terminate his services.

At the Wednesday meeting of the board, on November 4, 1914, Du Bois and
Spingarn savaged each other, while an appalled Ovington (partisan to Du
Bois) tried in vain to mediate. The magazine must be answerable to
himself, Spingarn announced. If its circulation was growing, so were its
debts to the printer and to office-supply firms. The editor voyaged
about the country on the association's budget in order to talk about
himself and his magazine. The time Du Bois spent on NAACP business was
insufficient, as Nerney had long complained. Du Bois coldly retorted
that he could not be dictated to. Instead, he would assume full
responsibility for [Crisis]{.epub-i} debts, accept general guidance from
a three-man committee appointed by the board with his concurrence, and
relinquish his NAACP salary. It was a declaration of a clean break with
the NAACP. Spingarn snapped that Du Bois was ""childish and difficult,""
and in the heat of the meeting went on to charge that the NAACP's
problems centered around ""a single individual""---an ""insubordinate""
officer. A flabbergasted Ovington surprised herself by crying out that
she could ""get on with Du Bois if others couldn't."" GrimkÃ©, who had come
up from Washington, joined by Cardozo from the Baltimore branch, sailed
into Du Bois for his obduracy, eloquently backing Spingarn's demands
with a motion to abolish the July executive
committee.[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-56){#cha-56}

""You think I idolize him---and perhaps I do,"" Ovington wrote Spingarn
three days afterward. ""To me, the rest of us on the Board are able
journeymen doing one day's work to be forgotten tomorrow. But Du Bois is
the master builder, whose work will speak to men as long as there is an
oppressed race on the earth."" Du Bois's sentiments exactly. The furious
editor wrote to new board member George Crawford in New Haven that
Spingarn had behaved exactly like Villard. Without prior discussion, the
chairman ""suddenly demanded complete and supreme power over the affairs
of the Association, including [The Crisis.]{.epub-i}"" Du Bois and
Spingarn lobbied for their cause with the intensity of ward heelers,
neither willing any longer to give the other a hearing. Du Bois's
temperament was hardly the ""fragile and delicate thing"" idolaters
(Spingarn used the word) like Ovington claimed. Du Bois was tough, and
he played the race card to get his way. Spingarn absolutely failed to
see the logic of Du Bois's contention that the NAACP couldn't ""fetter
him in any way because it is important that a colored man should have
the opportunity to acquire authority."" Furthermore, Spingarn argued that
because of his ""tactless temperament"" and inability to ""mix,"" Du Bois's
unpopularity among African-Americans was ""extraordinarily wide and
deep."" Much of the unpopularity stemmed from jealousy, to be sure, but
the plain fact, nevertheless, was that the board had to protect Du Bois
from himself---in order to save him for the mission. Talk to GrimkÃ©,
Cardozo, and Sinclair, Spingarn urged doubters. ""They resent spending
their hard-earned money in order merely to furnish Dr. Du Bois with a
halo and a luxurious setting for [The Crisis.]{.epub-i}"" Du Bois's
position with us must be ""impregnable; he must not be a source of
controversy but part and parcel of all our work and all our plans. He
must not be coddled as a thing apart, a constant disproof of our hopes
that white men and black men can work
together.""[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-57){#cha-57} Finally,
Spingarn claimed to be fully ready for an African-American head of the
NAACP (""a likely and appropriate thing to do""), but he hardly supposed
that Du Bois was temperamentally fitted for the office.

That Spingarn, like Villard, could diminish [The Crisis]{.epub-i} as
merely ""a good illustrated magazine"" proved, Du Bois believed and
underscored, that only vision could make an organization---never vice
versa. For the sake of a large vision, he would not have any of his
""power and discretion taken away."" He and Spingarn might find a way to
work together, but he would never be ""reduced to the position of Mr.
Spingarn's assistant instead of being a responsible officer, responsible
directly to the Board."" The struggle within the NAACP was both personal
and symbolic---epic, he told Crawford, summoning the New Haven ally to
the December board meeting. ""Of course, the old thing that we always
fear is tending to happen in the Association. It is tending to become a
white man's organization working for the colored people in which no
colored people have any real power."" In the white world, ability,
temperament, determination were assets---""the rule of effective
work""---but, as his racial experience of nearly half a century cruelly
reconfirmed, ""the colored man gets no such chance. He is seldom given
authority or freedom; when he gets these things he gets them
accidentally,"" as with the creation of [The Crisis.]{.epub-i} ""Even when
his ability is patent,"" wise and cautious white people deem it
""inexpedient to trust him."" Everything ""tends to this break along the
color line.""[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-58){#cha-58} For Du
Bois, the encouraging fact that there were small yet growing numbers of
white people free of prejudice and unequivocally enlisted in the crusade
against Jim Crow was reason not for celebration but for rededicated
militancy, and he governed his office manners accordingly.

There was little need for the editor's posturing, said GrimkÃ© at the
tempestuous December 1 board meeting, delivering an impassioned
criticism of the editor's motion virtually exempting himself from
Spingarn's control. Even Ovington shared Spingarn's apprehensions about
Du Bois assuming the magazine's debts. A bankrupt [Crisis]{.epub-i}
would have a devastating impact upon the movement. The smooth Paul
Kennaday, a white board member who acted as secretary, succeeded in
tempering the deliberations by presenting a series of compromise draft
motions, some based on Du Bois's arguments and some on Spingarn's. The
final result was the disbandment of the executive committee established
under the July order. The chairman recovered full control as the
association's executive officer with authority over the heads of all
departments between meetings of the board. All but four of the twenty
members present---Ovington, Crawford, Kennaday, and Verina Morton-Jones,
one of the few female African-American physicians---sided against Du
Bois. For Villard, the editor's defeat was made even more gratifying
because of the six-month financial retrenchment program Villard was
asked to put together. Within two months, the treasurer's economies
would generate an interest-bearing ""nest egg"" for the first
time.[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-59){#cha-59} But Du Bois's
rebuff was actually more apparent than real. He himself had adroitly
reversed gears and joined in recommending abolition of the executive
committee in return for the incorporation of the magazine, the
establishment of a special [Crisis]{.epub-i} fund under his control, and
the creation of a [Crisis]{.epub-i} committee consisting of the chairman
and two other board members (one of whom, it was understood, would be
Ovington). ""The Director of Publications and Research"" (he had his title
slightly changed), the voted motion read, ""with the advice and consent
of the [Crisis]{.epub-i} Committee shall have power to administer the
[Crisis]{.epub-i} Fund and formulate the policy of [The
Crisis.]{.epub-i}""[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-60){#cha-60} The
more or less permanent structure of the NAACP, and Du Bois's position in
it, had finally coalesced.

Motions were voted and committees formed, yet very little remained
settled for long in the early NAACP. Exactly one year after the December
1914 board meeting that restructured the organization, Du Bois and his
supporters were once again repulsing attacks by Spingarn, Villard, and
others. Du Bois's commitment of time to the Washington production of the
[Star of Ethiopia]{.epub-i} pageant was under attack. The cover of the
November 1915 [Crisis]{.epub-i} displaying a beautiful, very light
skinned woman, whose bare shoulder and sultry gaze glowed seductively at
readers from the chiaroscuro of her stylish chapeau, scandalized the
Boston branch, along with Villard who called it ""simply shocking."" But
what outraged practically the entire board was this anniversary issue's
""We Come of Age,"" a lengthy, self-satisfied piece about the magazine's
success. The relationship between the association and [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} was straightforward. Very simply, Du Bois explained,
the NAACP was the ""legal owner of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} and [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} is its official organ."" But as astonished board members
read with consternation, Du Bois informed the public that the NAACP had
""never expended a single cent for the publication of [The
Crisis.]{.epub-i}"" In fact, rent, utilities for the magazines quarters,
as well as salaries of Du Bois's staff were billed to the association's
budget. The editor's salary from the NAACP had risen to \$3,000---\$750
more than Nerney's. According to the editor, however, the story of large
successes was due entirely to himself, his devoted staff, and ""volunteer
workers like Mary White Ovington, Maud Cuney Hare, Martha Gruening and
others."" On January 1, the magazine would be entirely on its own, the
board learned, with the editor's salary transferred from the NAACP
budget to a special [Crisis]{.epub-i} fund. By April 1, 1915, Du Bois
predicted ""the great goal of FIFTY THOUSAND subscribers and purchasers.""
""The only comment I have to make,"" a despairing Villard told Spingarn,
who was now deeply distraught about Du Bois's one-man show, ""is that the
National Association will never do its duty by itself until it removes a
man of Dr. Du Bois's spirit from all connection with
it.""[[61]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-61){#cha-61}

If the chairman recognized that dispensing with the editor's services
was out of the question, he thought that a majority of the board would
surely support a recommendation by the three-person [Crisis]{.epub-i}
committee ordering Du Bois to confine his activities to [The
Crisis,]{.epub-i} unless the board gave explicit permission for an
exception. Once again, the editor turned from female suffrage, lynching,
Haitian sovereignty, and discrimination in education to present a
ringing ultimatum to the board. The December 1914 compromise had been
unfair, he now declared in December 1915, explaining that he had
accepted it merely to avoid ""further bickering and to appease all
parties."" Since then, however, the ""supervisory"" authority of the
chairman had stealthily become more intrusive, threatening to stand
between the editor and the board. That could not be. He could not be
confined to his office, forgoing speaking engagements, theatrical
productions, book contracts, and writing commissions. ""This Association
knew who I was before it appointed me; it knew my ideas and
personality."" He had not come to the NAACP ""as a clerk."" He came as an
executive ""with power and direction."" As board members took their seats
around the long table on Monday afternoon, December 13, each of them
knew that the director of publications and research had his resignation
in his pocket, ""to be accepted at the earliest possible convenience of
the Board."" Once again, the squirming board, faced with an inescapable
choice, abandoned the chairman for the editor, voting that it would be
""inexpedient"" to issue commands to Du Bois. Spingarn exploded,
submitting his resignation as chairman. Villard joined him, provoking
Nerney to write that he had done so ""nine hundred and ninety nine
times.""[[62]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-62){#cha-62}

The stage seemed finally set, then, for an association remade in Du
Bois's image. Either Milholland or Ovington would become chairperson,
while the Department of Publications and Research would function
independently, smiting white iniquity and galvanizing the oppressed.
Taking advantage of what appears to have been a momentary softening, Du
Bois invited GrimkÃ© to join him in recommending a new chairperson. The
choices were limited, he explained. Spingarn's replacement would have to
live in New York (which eliminated GrimkÃ©), would have to have
independent means, and, above all, would have to work with Nerney. Who
else could such a person be but Ovington? ""Men simply do not understand
her and are quite unable to cope with her."" Less than a month after this
December 23 letter, Nerney decided she had had enough and surprised Du
Bois and the board by resigning. Until then, she had been ""racking
\[her\] brains"" to come up with a successor to Spingarn, identifying
Jessie Fauset and Theodore M. Gregory, a Howard University assistant
professor, as possible candidates. Her last official recommendation was
that an able, diplomatic African-American succeed her and that a
""competent organizer or field agent with the sole responsibility for
organizing branches"" be hired. As the executive secretary prepared to
leave and the chairman began to regret his temper tantrum, Du Bois
proposed an ingenious solution to the association's troubles. He would
become executive secretary while retaining his post at [The
Crisis.]{.epub-i} Nerney found herself toying with the idea. She
confessed to a disconcerted Spingarn (still acting as chairman) that she
was ""one of those who regard his \[ability\] as infinitely superior to
my own.""[[63]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-63){#cha-63} If Du Bois
weren't black and she weren't a woman they would both have had an easier
time, she sighed.

The prospect of an NAACP dominated by Du Bois galvanized the opposition.
Joseph Prince Loud, a Boston Brahmin, along with Butler Wilson,
simultaneously pushed Archibald GrimkÃ© for chairman while pleading with
Spingarn to reconsider. ""My friend, you must not quit us now,"" Wilson
wrote Spingarn. Meanwhile, the search for Nerney's replacement
proceeded. Whether Du Bois suggested John Hope first or urged his
candidacy after Spingarn mentioned him as a possibility, a quick
consensus on the Morehouse president emerged among key board members. It
is also likely that Spingarn, already reconsidering his resignation,
favored Hope in order to keep Du Bois out of the secretaryship. Hope
would also be an effective answer to any charges of too much white input
in the association. Alerting his friend to the offer coming his way, the
sardonic editor wrote that Nerney ""complained and fussed and worked
herself into such hysteria that everybody was glad to have her
go.""[[64]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-64){#cha-64} Hope gave the
offer serious consideration, but well before his definitive refusal in
late October, the association's mix of egos and agendas had been stirred
several times over by new crises. Spingarn and Villard had been
flattered back on to the board. Du Bois was preoccupied with his
magazine. A major interracial conference of radicals and conservatives
had been held on Spingarn's estate in Amenia, New York. Writing Spingarn
that his offer was ""one of the most attractive offers that can come to a
colored man at this time,"" Hope stayed at Morehouse and Royal F. Nash, a
white social worker, succeeded
Nerney.[[65]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter17-65){#cha-65} But Du Bois's
concern about the African-American presence in the NAACP was
significantly alleviated when James Weldon Johnson was hired as branch
organizer that December.

The turbulence during these two years---1915 and 1916---left most of the
NAACP's institutional problems unresolved, yet it did establish that the
editor of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} was indispensable and that, when
disputes arose and policy was recast, the NAACP would have to
accommodate itself to its brilliant, battling, contumacious director of
publications and research.

[T[HE]{.epub-sc} S[OULS OF]{.epub-sc} B[LACK]{.epub-sc}
F[OLK]{.epub-sc}]{.epub-i}

A[LMOST ONE]{.epub-sc} year to the day after publication of his review
of [Up From Slavery,]{.epub-i} in mid-July 1902, Du Bois received an
unusually sympathetic letter from Booker T. Washington. [The
Outlook]{.epub-i} had just carried Du Bois's editorial on southern
public school conditions, a piece the Tuskegee principal apparently
thought much of, and he went on to praise the ""hard work"" behind the
Atlanta University investigations. Washington's communiquÃ© was also a
much-delayed reply to Du Bois's note that March explaining that a
northern lecture tour had kept him from attending the annual Tuskegee
conference. In that note Du Bois had seemed to hint at a tactical
understanding between them. Washington had to grant, he wrote, that he,
Du Bois, had ""sought in every way to minimize the breach between
colleges and industrial schools and \[had\] tried in all possible ways
to cooperate with Tuskegee in its work."" Unfortunately, Tuskegee had not
entirely reciprocated, Du Bois thought. ""You may feel that you are not
very much encouraged in your efforts,"" Washington's July letter purred,
but he wanted the professor to know that his labors were
appreciated.[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-1){#cha-1}
Superficially fine in sentiment, the Wizard's letter also served to
remind Du Bois of how isolated and impotent he really was. After he had
turned down the Tuskegee professorship in April 1900, ever-more-powerful
forces---forces profoundly unsympathetic to his aspirations---were
reshaping the higher education of African-Americans.

In the white South, these forces spoke derisively of the very notion of
higher education for black people; some of them barely conceded even the
utility of the three R's. In the North, the new creed found more
euphemistic expression, such as that issuing from the 1896 conference on
""the higher education of the colored people"" at Saratoga, New York, in
early September. Reporting to philanthropist and Hampton Institute
trustee George Foster Peabody (cousin of the Peabody Fund founder) on
this watershed conclave, Baptist H. L. Wayland of Philadelphia was
delighted by the new thinking. Booker Washington had spoken at Saratoga
""admirably"" about the need for practical education and for getting away
from the liberal arts and Latin. A few sentimentalists like General T.
J. Morgan and Rhode Island's Episcopal Bishop William MacVickar still
pushed for Greek and Latin and refused ""to take counsel with common
sense,"" regretted Wayland, but they were now clearly in the minority. As
an officer of the Baptist Home Mission Society, Wayland himself had
argued at Saratoga a duty ""to give them \[the colored people\] what we
conscientiously think best, and it is our right to do so since we pay
for it ourselves."" If schools like Atlanta and Fisk continued with dead
languages, then the Baptists would simply withdraw funding from their
students ""and give it to the support of Baptist young men at Hampton and
Tuskegee.""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-2){#cha-2}

When Du Bois received Washington's compliments about his piece in [The
Outlook,]{.epub-i} the work of the new educational creed was already
being mightily advanced by two new foundations. Supplementing and soon
absorbing the work of the Peabody and Slater funds were the Southern
Education Board (SEB), founded in 1901, and the prodigiously endowed
General Education Board (GEB), established early the following year. A
partial roster of the officers and trustees of the new SEB was a roll
call of the arbiters of the Industrial North and the New South: Robert
C. Ogden, director of New York's new Wanamaker's department store;
William H. Baldwin, Jr., of railroads North and South; George Foster
Peabody of Wall Street and Episcopalian benignity; Charles D. McIver,
president of the Southern Educational Association; North Carolinian
Walter Hines Page of Doubleday, Page and Company, publishers, and future
ambassador to the Court of Saint James; Daniel Gilman of Johns Hopkins
University; and Jabez Curry, Edgar Gardner Murphy, and Charles William
Dabney, three distinguished southern educators and moderates. In terms
of budget, the SEB was a relatively modest enterprise operating on an
annual subsidy of less than sixty thousand dollars from the GEB. Its
role was primarily one of scrutiny, advice, propaganda, and lobbying for
public funding of education, not direct disbursement of funds to
institutions. Eleven of the SEB's officers sat continually on the board
of the GEB, influencing policy in all matters pertaining to
African-Americans.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-3){#cha-3}

Jabez Curry, whose spare frame bore saber slashes from Confederate
cavalry campaigns, recorded in his diary the historic New York dinner at
which the junior Rockefeller pledged one million dollars of his father's
money to start the GEB. The setting that evening could hardly have been
more propitious for interregional understanding---an oak-paneled study
with the fire in the great hearth reflecting in generous brandy
snifters. ""Meeting harmonious and every vote unanimous,"" Curry noted.
""We sat until after
midnight.""[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-4){#cha-4} There were to
be many such evenings and many more millions---a head-spinning \$52
million bestowed by John D. Rockefeller, Sr., between June 1905 and July
1909. Reverend Frederick Taylor Gates, spiritual counselor to the
Baptist Rockefellers, had warned the cadaverous patriarch that, unless
some institutional means of disbursing them were devised, the obscene
piling up of millions would bring ruin upon the family. A legion of
muckrakers had already declared open season on the God-fearing founder
of Standard Oil and his robber-baron fraternity. Gates's solution to
Rockefeller social and spiritual disquietude was in what he called
""scientific giving"" (a variation of Carnegie's principle of ""scientific
philanthropy""), primarily through the
GEB.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-5){#cha-5}

The impact of the board was unprecedented as it substituted for a
nonexistent federal department of education. Its cautious decisions at
61 Broadway (an easy stroll to Rockefeller headquarters at 26 Broadway)
were paramount in matters of endowment, capital construction,
professional schools, fields of specialization, and fellowships for
scholars. Twenty-eight years after its founding, the GEB would have
distributed \$176,984,000 to historically white colleges and
universities and \$21,999,349 to those serving African-Americans
(although less than \$1 million would be allocated to the latter until
after World War I).[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-6){#cha-6}
Something of a visionary with a morbid fear of germs and a greater faith
in science than in the dogmas of his Baptist denomination, the
compelling Gates chose a former New York postal clerk to run the
Leviathan GEB. Wallace Buttrick was forty-nine, a large man with a slim
theological education, affable and cautious, and thoroughly ignorant of
the South and of black people everywhere. Soon after taking up the
executive secretaryship, a troubled Buttrick confided that, while the
dictates of ""absolute justice"" should reserve a proportionate share of
GEB largesse to African-Americans, the philanthropy would risk
destruction if it demanded ""too much from the white people of the
South.""[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-7){#cha-7}

That was exactly how the GEB's first chairmen, Baldwin and Ogden, saw
the matter. Looking back after sixty years, Raymond B. Fosdick, the last
chairman, would admit that Baldwin's conviction that African-Americans
""could not be educated much beyond the three R's"" was slightly
surprising in a Bostonian of abolitionist pedigree. Fosdick could
explain it only by underscoring the ""vast revolution of ideas and social
habits \[that\] has swept over the decades
since.""[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-8){#cha-8} Baldwin and Ogden
were determined to let nothing impede the regional reconciliation and
southern modernization that their kind of educational policy and capital
investment was intended to foster. Their supreme faith in the path they
were exhorting others to follow led them to impute wicked and dangerous
motives to those who insisted on traveling another route. George Foster
Peabody, now retired to Abenia, his Lake George estate, usually urged
more kindly dealings with the misguided; but, in the final analysis, he
invariably leant his considerable influence to the promotion of the
Ogden-Baldwin monopoly in African-American education. Although
Washington was not invited to deliberate with them when the new
foundations were conceived, Baldwin duly informed the Tuskegeean of his
appointment as a salaried field agent of the
SEB.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-9){#cha-9} Poker-faced,
devious, honored by Harvard, Yale, and Amherst, graced with a special
relationship to Presidents McKinley and Roosevelt, and supreme
gatekeeper of rewards, Washington was now assigned the part of
disciplinarian of truant African-Americans.

Yet even in their era of Anglo-Saxon election, Billy Baldwin and Bob
Ogden had critics among their own ranks, men and women like Boston
Brahmin Francis Garrison, Manhattan journalist-entrepreneur John Edgar
Milholland, and New York reformer Mary Ovington who pleaded that deeply
disadvantaged people needed more, not less, education and employment and
that enlightened northern interests must hold fast to the distinction
between principled collaboration with the white South and frantic
appeasement of it. These Old Believers, as they might have been labeled,
saw the influence of Baldwin and Ogden as eventually ruinous to the
cause of the African-American and, ironically, eventually fatal to
Booker Washington. ""You cannot educate men, even in manual skill,""
William Garrison, Jr., warned the Wizard, ""and fit them to occupy the
menial position that a caste community (like the South) decrees.""
Milholland, one of the country's most successful businessmen and a
staunch defender of civil liberties, issued similar
warnings.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-10){#cha-10}

In fairness to Baldwin, Ogden, and the younger Peabody, whose
considerable Yankee energies and a portion of whose fortunes went into
the cause of racial conciliation, what they were attempting was
inherently thankless and unknowingly flawed in theory. In their vision
of a racially placid South with a two-tiered, complementary work force,
black people as well as white would prosper gradually, capital would
flow into the region and handsome profits would flow out of it, and, at
some distant point, civil rights and political democracy would be
restored. To the extent that Baldwin, Ogden, and the others genuinely
embraced that vision, they were extravagantly sanguine. They insisted on
ignoring the raw scramble for resources in the region, the irresistible
temptations for politicians to exploit class and race, and thus they
were bewildered when confronted with that crimson factor of which
northern philanthropists lived in awful dread and could never fully
comprehend---the South's peculiar, underdeveloped mentality of violence
and irrationality. The occasional insight---such as Ogden's that the
South ""is not yet through with the effort to reenslave the
Negro""---never counterbalanced the belief that public criticism of
southern white extremism would only make matters much worse. Moreover,
from SEB headquarters in Montgomery, Alabama, the young, easily
depressed executive secretary, Episcopal clergyman Edgar Gardner Murphy,
would keep up a steady tattoo of alarums about powder kegs, tinder
boxes, uncontrollable passions, and other quotidian southern dangers.
""It is useless---utterly useless---to challenge it,"" he cautioned in
report after report.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-11){#cha-11}

If their postabolitionist assumptions about the South conveniently
rationalized its inequality and repression, Baldwin, Ogden, and Peabody
would have shrilly protested the inference of bad faith. Like the
revered Rockefeller Senior, they, too, rejoiced to find in the precepts
of Carnegie's ""Gospel of Wealth"" article the justification for business
and social behavior that was second nature anyhow. Intense individualism
was good and produced great wealth, but enormous wealth, Carnegie had
warned, carried with it the awesome duty of administering wealth ""for
the common goodÂ ... through the hands of the
few.""[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-12){#cha-12} Above all,
therefore, Ogden, Baldwin, and their collaborators labored to bring
prosperity to the South in order to bring prosperity to
themselves---which is not to say that the Ogdens and Baldwins schemed to
turn a profit directly from their good works. Rather, they subscribed to
a secular brand of Calvinism that anticipated compensation in ways
large, indirect, and delayed as signals from a pleased Providence of
their election. In making the South a place where commerce and industry
flourished, they were contributing to the greater prosperity of the
American commonwealth---and thus, inevitably, to the value of their own
myriad, interlocked investments. There had been a few temptations for
immediate gain at the outset, but they had been resisted. On becoming
one of General Armstrong's earliest trustees, Ogden had toyed briefly
with a late-1870s scheme to supply Wanamaker's of Philadelphia with
calico shirts produced by cheap black laborers trained and supervised by
Hampton student teachers. ""The fact speaks for itself,"" Ogden's
enthusiastic expert at Hampton had advised. Northern manufacturers could
be underbid by the skill the students provided. ""In fact,"" Ogden's man
ventured, ""you could be able to work in more student labour than you
would imagine, forÂ ... they seem to be even more quick to learn than the
average outside hand.""[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-13){#cha-13}

Baldwin and Ogden never ceased to enjoin black people in the South to
fill menial positions and to farm land they would seldom own so that
white people could monopolize the industrial and urban sectors. They
spoke of the migration of black people from the countryside to the
South's new cities and towns as the greatest of calamities, a phenomenon
bound to imperil ""racial harmony"" and good business. The pulse of the
New South was urban, nonpaternalistic, industrial, stimulated by the
Atlantas, Birminghams, Charlottes, Durhams, and Spartanburgs, and other
Piedmont factory and textile towns---expanding centers where low-income
white and black people rubbed each other raw in public spaces and voting
booths.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-14){#cha-14} Mass migration
of African-Americans to the cities and towns of the South meant
continual political turbulence and the nourishment of demagogues pledged
to save the region from ""nigger rule."" Bad as conditions were, pragmatic
northern philanthropists like Baldwin, Ogden, Peabody, and others saw
worse coming: the erection of an ironclad system of legal and physical
apartheid, the coming of Jim Crow with its quadruple public bathrooms,
special trains and tramways, separate restaurants and hotels, double
waiting rooms, color-coded drinking fountains---an absurd array of
artificial distinctions prohibitive to cost-effective
business.[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-15){#cha-15}

By 1902, Ogden's stake in the New South was unique. If the ebullient
Peabody exemplified the northern businessman who devoted large amounts
of time to philanthropy in the South, Ogden's business [was]{.epub-i}
philanthropy. Baldwin remained the man of affairs deeply involved in
southern good works, but Ogden became northern philanthropy's special
emissary, devoting a good portion of his tax-free annual salary of a
hundred thousand dollars to the region. Others sent money; Ogden sent
himself. In 1900, he became president of the Conference for Education in
the South, a two-year-old conclave at Capon Springs, West Virginia,
using the Lake Mohonk meetings as its model and taking place under the
guidance of Edgar Gardner Murphy. ""In the Negro is the opportunity of
the South,"" alter ego Baldwin declared at the second Capon Springs
meeting---a statement that could have served as the motto for what
became widely known as the ""Ogden
Movement.""[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-16){#cha-16} Ogden now
applied to his movement the business and public-relations abilities that
had pushed Wanamaker's to the front rank of American department stores.
The first ""Ogden Special"" sped out of New York City the third week in
April 1901, to be followed every April for the next eight years by a
special Pullman caravan rolling through the South to the conference
meeting sites, halting a few hours at principal white and black colleges
and universities to disgorge the Anglo-Saxon Protestant power elite of
the United States.

White college presidents all but threw themselves across the tracks to
stop the Ogden Special. ""The Davidson \[College\] campus is less than
one hundred yards from the station,"" Dr. Henry Louis Smith telegraphed
Ogden, pleading for a visit. ""The rapid disappearance of sectionalism,""
President Abercrombie of the University of Alabama swore, was ""in large
measure due to your
labor.""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-17){#cha-17} At Hampton
Institute, Rockefellers, Doubledays, Macys, Phelps-Stokeses, Villards,
Plimptons, Pages, and other families rested a day or more in the
campus's guest house, watched the cadets drill, and thrilled to the
student choir's spirituals. ""Hope you can arrange program and remain at
Tuskegee until 12:45 or 1 o'clock,"" Washington telegraphed as the fourth
special approached, for so keen was the competition that not even his
campus was guaranteed a place in the itinerary---though this time Ogden
penciled across the bottom, ""Will stay another hour."" The popularity of
these excursions into the exotic South was enormous. The junior
Rockefeller continued to hope that he and Mrs. Rockefeller ""might enjoy
a repetition of the pleasure which I derived"" on the first sortie in
1901.[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-18){#cha-18} It was, he
added, ""the most instructive experience of my life."" Ogden had
successfully floated the plan for the SEB amid the plush and copious
provisions of that first caravan, receiving assurances of Rockefeller
support. Not even the crash of the 1905 Special near Greenville, South
Carolina, from which Mrs. Henry Farnam emerged with a broken nose and
Jabez Curry minus his Bible (Ogden covered all damages), dampened
enthusiasm. An indignant Ogden did contemplate disbanding the Specials
after southern white criticism began likening them, as one New Jersey
clergyman wrote him, to ""driving a coach and six to give charity andÂ ...
misleading the Negroes."" The delicate Murphy persuaded him not to do so,
however.[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-19){#cha-19}

For Ogden, much more than for Baldwin, the successful policy was one
that was micromanaged. As he said to Murphy, speaking of the Negro
problem: ""We cannot meet the views of our colored friends and must be
content to be greatly misunderstood."" Were Dr. William Crum to withdraw
his name before the Senate took up his confirmation as Charleston
customs collector, Ogden told the Great Accommodator, it would be seen
as ""a stroke of wise and triumphant policy."" He approved Tuskegee
trustee Henry C. Davis's second thoughts about the principal's presence
in New York at the Union League dinner in Edgar Murphy's honor. Courtesy
demanded that alumnus Washington be invited to attend Hampton's
anniversary unveiling of busts honoring white donors, but Ogden advised
Principal Frissell that he thought it would ""be in line of delicacy for
\[Washington\] to decline."" When Washington finally complained loudly
about being shut out of SEB deliberations, Baldwin decided not to
forward the principal's letter to Ogden ""because it would seem like a
criticism.""[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-20){#cha-20}

Since Ogden's feelings about African-American liberal arts schools,
especially Atlanta University, verged on pure hatred, the Special
steamed through Georgia without the pilgrims bothering to visit the
Atlanta University campus. ""Your fellow-travellers were so
strongly---not to say bitterly---prejudiced against it,"" Francis
Garrison angrily noted in a letter to Oswald Villard after his nephew's
return from the 1902 excursion. ""When the Ogden party visited Atlanta
last year, they deliberately ignored the University."" Ogden's animus was
reinforced by associates like Murphy who warned that visiting black
liberal arts colleges was tantamount to waving Union battle flags before
Confederate infantry. ""It would be a serious mistake to go to Talladega
\[College\], at all, at this time,"" the clergyman would write before the
1904 Special left New York. With Tom Heflin, Alabama's star Negrophobe,
fulminating that election year, ""battle lines \[were\] now slowly
forming,"" Murphy
bleated.[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-21){#cha-21}

With so much at stake, the men behind the SEB and the GEB displayed
considerable skill in spotting potential troublemakers. ""The control was
to be drastic,"" Du Bois claimed in [Dusk of Dawn.]{.epub-i} ""The Negro
intelligentsia was to be suppressed and hammered into conformity. The
process involved some cruelty and disappointment, but that was
inevitable.""[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-22){#cha-22}
Cosmopolitans like Du Bois, espousing higher learning for
African-Americans, embodied all the deracination and uppityness bred by
the cities. The foundation notables and their peers increasingly looked
upon him with his haughty self-assurance and compellingly written
findings and opinions as an intolerable sport. As suspicion turned into
hostility, the formidable suasion of the SEB and the unprecedented
resources of the GEB were applied to marginalize a thirty-five-year-old
academic whose only defenses were a brain, a pen, and audacity.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

I[N THE]{.epub-sc} Bookerite scheme of things, Du Bois was a minor
irritant with the capacity for major damage, unless he were coopted or
neutralized. Frissell's vague proposal early in 1900 for a scholarly
journal at Hampton had died shortly after Du Bois insisted on being the
sole judge of its editorial policy. Much later, Du Bois wondered if more
diplomacy on his part might not have won him a free editorial hand, but,
upon further reflection, he doubted it---""any magazine launched at that
time would have been seriously curtailed in its freedom of
speech.""[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-23){#cha-23} Then, a
little more than a month after Washington sent him a ""personal and
confidential"" promise to help defray the legal expenses connected with
his railroad segregation case before the ICC (""provided I can hand it to
you personally""), an invitation to an early January 1903 interracial
conference in New York came from Wallace Buttrick. The conference was
badly set up, with Buttrick and several others who were expected to
attend making only perfunctory appearances, although Baldwin, who
presided, seemed genuinely pleased, convinced that the meeting was a
promising step toward the establishing of a permanent organization. In
fact, the Mount Olivet Church meeting did eventually lead to something
more---the National Urban League---but in Du Bois's version,
[he]{.epub-i} was the central issue, and the late-afternoon Conference
on the Negro in New York City was mainly a smokescreen. He found himself
in Baldwin's cordial care, whisked from the West Fifty-third Street
church to a sumptuous dinner with Ruth Standish Baldwin on their Long
Island estate. ""Both he and his wife insisted that my place was at
Tuskegee,"" that the school needed the Atlanta professor's training and
intelligence. The Baldwins were accomplished persuaders, a combination
of steel and velvet (a Smith College alumna, Ruth Baldwin thrived on
causes, becoming the National Urban League's first president); Du Bois
very likely returned to Manhattan aboard the GEB chairman's railroad
pledged to reopen the Tuskegee
option.[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-24){#cha-24}

Two meetings with the Wizard are supposed to have taken place in New
York, presumably at the end of 1902 and early the following year. Du
Bois's description of them was satirically and dramatically triumphant,
but it fails to square with the facts. He wrote as though he and
Washington were complete strangers. ""He did not know me, and I think he
was suspicious,"" wrote Du Bois. ""On the other hand, I was quick,
fast-speaking and voluble. I found at the end of the first interview
that I had done practically all the talking.... In fact, Mr. Washington
had said as near nothing as possible."" On his guard during their second
encounter, Du Bois claimed that he held his tongue, with the result that
the two of them sat together in almost complete silence. Had the New
York interviews occurred before 1901, Du Bois's re-creation would be
credible, but giveaway references to Buttrick and the GEB fix the time
frame as post 1902, and by then there had been much letter writing,
several public encounters, and at least two visits (February 1900 and
1901) to the Tuskegee
campus.[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-25){#cha-25} Of greater
significance, there had been the painfully fishy business of the D.C.
assistant superintendency.

Either these two fateful meetings occurred much earlier than Du Bois
remembered (before the evening at the Baldwins and before the creation
of the two education boards), in which case they lose some of their
sinister power in the retelling, or, more plausibly, they are
imaginative rearrangements of actual fragments, composite truths,
throwing into stark relief the hostility faced by Du Bois and his circle
in Booker T. Washington's America. Du Bois's representation is one of
mental and moral estrangement that was almost molecular---an
oil-and-water antinomy making misunderstanding and conflict inevitable.
But if Du Boisian license cast Washington as the straight man in their
epic rough-and-tumble routine, the Columbia University oral history,
almost sixty years later, may have been as accurate as a GEB ledger:
""Oh, Washington was a politician. He was a man who believed that we
should get what we could get. It wasn't a matter of ideals or anything
of that sort.... He had no faith in white people, not the slightest, and
he was most popular among them, because if he was talking with a white
man he sat there and found out what the white man wanted him to say, and
then as soon as possible, he said it."" That had never been Du Bois's
approach to what African-Americans invariably called the other race.
Invited to lecture on Atlanta University to the annual and exclusive
education conference at Bar Harbor, Maine, in late August 1903, he
politely turned aside the Tuskegee counsels of lexicographer Charles
Merriam, financier Jacob Schiff, pharmaceuticals heir William Jay
Schieffelin, and several others. [Outlook]{.epub-i} editor Lyman Abbott
was impressed by Du Bois's advocacy of higher education for
African-Americans, he told Du Bois at Bar Harbor, but Abbott pleaded
with him to rethink racial priorities: ""Industrial intelligence is of
the first importance.""[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-26){#cha-26}

By then, Du Bois had made up his mind to measure his beliefs against
those of Washington. The full implications of what he was about to do,
however, may not have been entirely clear. One should believe his
repeated insistence that he never wanted to descend from his tower of
contemplation and research to lead a protest movement, that he was ""no
natural leader of men,"" as well as his admission that, at that time, he
was still not ""in absolute opposition to the things that Mr. Washington
was advocating."" He was still keeping a safe distance from the handful
of men and women like Harvard classmate Monroe Trotter, successful
Chicago attorney and statehouse legislator Edward H. Morris, itinerant
philosopher and Yale and Harvard graduate William Ferris, and
antilynching crusader and settlement house pioneer Ida Wells-Barnett who
mounted platforms to denounce the Atlanta Compromise at every
opportunity. Du Bois was far from ready to cry out, as Morris did, that
Washington was ""largely responsible for the lynching in this country,""
or even to charge him with willful promotion of the doctrine of black
racial inferiority, as Ferris did in early 1903 before the District of
Columbia's distinguished Bethel Literary and Historical
Association.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-27){#cha-27} Du Bois
must have also clearly understood that to attack Washington was to
mistake shadow for substance, to fall into a trap of internecine
battling instead of laying the ground for all-out war on the real
enemy---the white people who ordained that an entire race should remain
indefinitely subordinate.

The problem with this view was that the Great Accommodator repeatedly
thrust himself between the cross hairs of Du Bois's true targets. The
Atlanta professor wanted not so much to throw down the gauntlet to the
Wizard's leadership as to protest what he perceived as the latter's
heavy-handedness in dealing with even the most tentative dissent from
the Tuskegee ideology. ""Things had come to such a pass,"" Du Bois
insisted many years afterward, ""that when any Negro complained or
advocated a course of action, he was silenced with the remark that Mr.
Washington did not agree with this."" As Du Bois saw his people
descending rapidly into the caste status of subhumans in the South and
into a marginalized mass in the North, the embrace of the Great
Accommodator and of his miscreant self-help nostrums increased. Behind
the ninety-nine lynchings of 1901, behind what one of his younger
disciples would call ""The Nadir""---tidal years of African-American
disfranchisement and victimization---Du Bois saw a metaphysic of
oppression that was both cause and effect. Forty-six years after Judge
Roger Brooke Taney's [Dred Scott]{.epub-i} opinion that
African-Americans were ""so far inferior that they had no rights the
white man was bound to respect,"" Du Bois agonized that the humanity of
an entire race was again a serious national
question.[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-28){#cha-28}

It was, then, the ethos, science, and propaganda of racial
dehumanization as much as Bookerite compromises that unsettled and
finally drove Du Bois into the ranks of so-called civil rights radicals.
It was grim enough that his people were being lynched in the South and
ghettoized in the North, but there now loomed the even more horrendous
prospect that such brutalities could cease to be deplored (however
formally or hypocritically) as un-American and become, in the regime of
the emergent ideology, officially sanctioned instruments of racial
subjugation. With rare exception, noted anthropologists located Negroes
somewhere on the frontier between the great apes and hominids.
Biologists found their average brain weight less than
Caucasians'---considerably less than English-speaking Protestants.
Psychologists identified a primal sexuality and irrationality in Negroes
that were invariably supposed to erupt in situations of intimacy or
stress. Physicians predicted their extinction from disease and
depravity, while criminologists and eugenicists warned of the menace of
Negro brutality and fecundity. The national white consensus emerging at
the turn of the century was that African-Americans were inferior human
beings whose predicament was three parts their own making and two parts
the consequence of misguided white philanthropy. Not long before serving
Booker Washington dinner in the White House, a characteristically blunt
Theodore Roosevelt had given a nutshell opinion: ""A perfectly stupid
race can never rise to a very high plane; the negro, for instance, has
been kept down as much by lack of intellectual development as by
anything else.""

[The Mystery Solved: The Negro a Beast]{.epub-i} was one of the notable
book titles of 1900, followed two years later by Thomas Dixon's
bestseller, [The Leopard's Spots,]{.epub-i} a building block for D. W
Griffith's film [The Birth of a Nation.]{.epub-i} One historian of the
South claims that the raving romantic Dixon ""probably did more to shape
the lives of modern Americans than have some Presidents."" Du Bois had
entered this debate head on with a forthright review in [Dial]{.epub-i}
of [The American Negro]{.epub-i} by William Hannibal Thomas, an
eccentric mulatto whose book denouncing his own people had been
published in 1901 by Macmillan. It was too unfair, Du Bois wrote, that,
just as ""a new race literature of a promise has appeared, and a race
consciousness such as the modern world has never before seen among black
folk,"" major publishing houses in the United States were giving over
their presses to pseudo-scientific and Gothic-romance libels. Whether he
felt rage or deep sadness when three years later his old Harvard geology
professor's magnum opus appeared, Du Bois left unrecorded. Shaler's [The
Neighbor: The Natural History of Human Contacts]{.epub-i} was no
best-seller, but its amalgam of anthropology, science, and history
commended it to serious readers. It asserted that, even under the best
conditions, African-Americans would remain civilization's
wards.[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-29){#cha-29} In such a
national climate, the inclination among white people to discriminate
between well-educated African-Americans and those still marked by
slavery was becoming rare.

Du Bois, who, as a student in Germany, had found great appeal in
theories that ranked races and invested them with specific attributes,
now began fully to grasp their inconvenient implications. The Harvard
man who had dismissed the Lodge Bill as unnecessary and betrayed
vicarious sympathy for the ruling classes veered in the direction of
social and economic democracy, although aristocratic prejudices
continued to tug at him. He resolved to write of the genius, humanity,
and enviable destiny of his race with such passion, eloquence, and
penetration that claims of African-American inferiority would be sent
reeling, never to recover full legitimacy and vitality, despite their
enormous resiliency.

[T[HE]{.epub-sc} S[OULS OF]{.epub-sc} B[LACK]{.epub-sc}
F[OLK]{.epub-sc},]{.epub-i} brought out by the Chicago firm of A. C.
McClurg and Company on April 18, 1903, redefined the terms of a
three-hundred-year interaction between black and white people and
influenced the cultural and political psychology of peoples of African
descent throughout the western hemisphere, as well as on the continent
of Africa. It was one of those events epochally dividing history into a
before and an after. Like fireworks going off in a cemetery, its
fourteen essays were sound and light enlivening the inert and the
despairing. It was an electrifying manifesto, mobilizing a people for
bitter, prolonged struggle to win a place in history. Ironically, even
its author was among the tens of thousands whose conceptions of
themselves were to be forever altered by the book. James Weldon Johnson,
a judge of great perspicacity in such matters, said the book's impact
was ""greater upon and within the Negro race than any other single book
published in this country since [Uncle Tom's Cabin.]{.epub-i}"" With
comparable perspicacity but less satisfaction, Henry James wondered how
things could have run to ground so badly that Du Bois's ""was the only
'Southern' book of any distinction published in many a year."" Max Weber
set about arranging for a German translation, writing Du Bois from
Heidelberg that he would be pleased to do the introduction to his
""splendid book.""[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-30){#cha-30}

In a rather offhand passage in [Dusk of Dawn]{.epub-i} about the genesis
of the collection, Du Bois explained that the McClurg company had
pressed him during 1902 to write several essays for immediate release as
a book. Demurring ""because books of essays almost always fall so flat,""
he finally agreed to gather ""a number of my fugitive pieces."" As his
literary executor, Herbert Aptheker, has noted, Du Bois's account of the
origins of [The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i} is ""excessively modest.""
Nine of the fourteen essays had seen life previously in major
publications of the day---[Atlantic Monthly, Dial, World's
Work]{.epub-i}---as well as the more specialized [Annals of the American
Academy of Political and Social Science]{.epub-i} and [New
World,]{.epub-i} a religious quarterly. But they were to be cut,
polished, and mounted with a jeweler's precision for the McClurg
collection. A good deal of new material was added in some cases, and
themes heightened by new endings. The lyrical sociology of ""Of the Black
Belt"" and ""Of the Quest of the Golden Fleece"" was decanted from ""The
Negro As He Really Is,"" which had appeared in the June 1901 [World's
Work.]{.epub-i} The polemical centerpiece, ""Of Mr. Booker T. Washington
and Others,"" was a deft reworking and expansion of the review of [Up
From Slavery]{.epub-i} in [Dial.]{.epub-i} The five new essays ranged
from confessional to fictional; all were intensely literary, and the
best of them---""Of the Wings of Atalanta,"" ""Of the Sorrow Songs,"" and,
debatably, ""Of Alexander Crummell""---of surpassing emotional power and
beauty, while ""Of the Passing of the First-Born"" and ""Of the Coming of
John"" ran to bathos and crimson. Yet what is weak or less successful in
[The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i} is but relative demerit in an
ensemble of transcendent intellectual passion and numinous
prose.[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-31){#cha-31}

Until [The Souls of Black Folk,]{.epub-i} the souls of black folk had
relied mostly on the sorrow songs---spirituals---to find expression. Du
Bois would carry throughout the volume the device of pairing Negro
spirituals with European verse---by Browning, Byron, Swinburne, Symons,
Tennyson---as epigraphs for each essay. He twinned them in this manner
in order to advance the then-unprecedented notion of the creative parity
and complementarity of white folk and black folk alike. Du Bois meant
the cultural symbolism of these double epigraphs to be profoundly
subversive of the cultural hierarchy of his time. Three years into yet
another century of seemingly unassailable European supremacy,
[Souls]{.epub-i} countered with the voices of the dark submerged and
unheard---those voices heard by him for the first time in the Tennessee
backcountry. Until his readers appreciated the message of the songs sung
in bondage by black people, Du Bois was saying, the words written in
freedom by white people would remain hollow and counterfeit.

The ""Forethought"" to [The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i} has something of
the function of a tuning fork, keeping the collection's marvelous prose
vibrations in low, perfect pitch. The tone is calmly portentous, as the
author settles the reader into his tale of ""the strange meaning of being
black here at the dawning of the Twentieth Century."" Elucidating that
meaning, Du Bois pens again the incomparable phrase that leaps from the
page into indelible memory: ""This meaning is not without interest to
you, Gentle Reader; for the problem of the Twentieth Century is the
problem of the
color-line.""[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-32){#cha-32} ""It is
hard for us, across the vast expanse of years""---St. Clair Drake,
intellectual disciple of Du Bois and author himself of an American
classic, would exhort a civil rights era audience---""to appreciate the
significance of these words or the courage it took to fling them
forth.""[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-33){#cha-33} Du Bois
possessed such courage in abundance. He also possessed passion in equal
measure---passion mediated by the written word. The shaping empire of
intellect reigned over both. From the first page of [The Souls of Black
Folk,]{.epub-i} Du Bois's mind, courage, and passion interact to create
a splendid diapason. It is as though the small hurts and large insults
of his own life---the visiting-card incident, the Harvard Glee Club
rejection, the dreadful day in LÃ¼beck, the demeaning University of
Pennsylvania title---have fused with those of the Sam Hoses and Ida B.
Wellses and ten millions more to merge Du Bois, for a noetic moment in
history, uniquely with the souls of all black people.

[Souls]{.epub-i} opens with ""Of Our Spiritual Strivings."" It had been
titled ""Strivings of the Negro People"" in the August 1897 [Atlantic
Monthly]{.epub-i} version, but its reincarnation here came with more
Ã©lan and pathos. Du Bois capped it with an epigraph of English poetry
and bars from the spiritual ""Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen."" The
troubles he and his people had seen, almost from the day the first
Africans were brought ashore from a Dutch ship in Jamestown harbor, Du
Bois memorably posed as a question in the opening page of the essay.
""Between me and the other world there is ever an unasked question:
unasked by some through feelings of delicacy; by others through the
difficulty of rightly framing it."" Posed in whatever form, that question
was, finally, ""How does it feel to be a problem?"" Du Bois announced that
he would address that problem from a new, unusual angle. ""Leaving, then,
the white world, I have stepped within the Veil, raising it that you may
view faintly its deeper recesses---the meaning of its religion, the
passion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater souls."" It
was, as Du Bois said, ""a tale twice told,"" but it was being told, and
told by him, for the first time in print.

Adopting a mythic, threnodic prose sometimes evocative of the Old
Testament, Du Bois illustrated this ""strange experience"" of being
defined as a problem through the traumatic, Great Barrington
visiting-card incident. In that ""wee wooden schoolhouse"" the bright,
carefree young boy suddenly discovers that he is forever different from
his white peers---""shut out from their world by a vast veil."" As in
Genesis, wherein innocence in Eden is followed by wisdom, exile, and
pain, [Souls]{.epub-i} mimics the language of that sweeping record of
suffering, wandering, and spiritual triumph. Du Bois contrasts his own
persevering adolescence---a David meeting and besting the odds (""But
they should not keep these prizes, I said"")---with the destroyed lives
of so many of the sons of Ham and Job: other black youth ""shrunk into
tasteless sycophancy, or into silent hatred of the pale world,"" crying
out, ""Why did God make me an outcast and a stranger in mine own house?""
It was the rare David whose spirit was not compressed and stunted by the
""walls strait and stubborn"" of race hatred. Between these walls, the
""sons of night"" had plodded on in resignation, ""or beat unavailing palms
against the stone.""[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-34){#cha-34}

Du Bois compressed a quarter century of black history into two long,
flowing paragraphs in ""Of Our Spiritual Strivings,"" the kind of feat
that was to become his signature. Suddenly, personal testimony and
lamentation give way to vast tableaux of Sphinxes and African grandeur,
then the descent into slavery follows where racial memory was kept vivid
by the black preacher until Jubilee Day commenced the heady time of
Reconstruction. Faith in the ballot was the first talisman of the
freedmen. After the ballot came the ""new visionÂ ... of 'book-learning.'""
Blocked and scorned again, it was hoped that the wages of obedient toil
and sweat could purchase security and respect. With what results, asked
Du Bois? ""The bright ideals of the past---physical freedom, political
power, the training of brains and the training of hands---all these have
waxed and waned, until even the last grows dim and overcast."" They had
been forced by serial disappointments to reevaluate what they could
become, yet the bedrock of black people's work, culture, and liberty
must remain the ballot. ""The power of the ballot we need in sheer
self-defense.""[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-35){#cha-35}
Clearly, here, he chose to overestimate the immediate practical value of
votes for southern black sharecroppers and day laborers, many of whose
ballots would be either controlled or excluded by white planters.

But something more was needed---the race must learn the lesson of the
Veil by cultivating the moral and creative energies that lay hidden in
the conditions of its very alienation. Scorned and exploited throughout
its history in the land of opportunity, his people had gradually
undergone a halving of identity, acquired a unique angle of vision, and
become habituated to a psychic subordination that handicapped it in the
past but could be turned to strengths in its future. This, the
primordial condition or dilemma of Du Bois's race, had never been so
nakedly exposed before, not even by Crummell. The African-American ""ever
feels his two-ness---an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two
unreconciled strivings,"" Du Bois wrote, echoing almost surely his
beloved Goethe's words in [Faust]{.epub-i} and even possibly those of
Ralph Waldo Emerson in ""The Transcendentalist."" ""Two warring ideals in
one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn
asunder,"" he continued, repeating word for word the ardent prose of his
[Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i} essay. ""The history of the American Negro is
the history of this strife---this longing to attain self-conscious
manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self."" Others
brooding over the outcast status of their people ultimately wished it
away in visions of future racial harmony or heavenly rewards, or, like
Douglass, put their faith in full assimilation. A few---Garnet, Delany,
Holly---had chosen the path of cultural separatism and expatriation.
Debate about what African-Americans were and what they should become had
been like a zero-sum game, shuttle-cocking between the Integrated
Society and the Black Zion. The genius of [The Souls of Black
Folk]{.epub-i} was that it transcended this dialectic in the most
obvious way---by affirming it in a permanent tension. Henceforth, the
destiny of the race could be conceived as leading neither to
assimilation nor separatism but to proud, enduring hyphenation.

It was a revolutionary conception. It was not just revolutionary; the
concept of the divided self was profoundly mystical, for Du Bois
invested this double consciousness with a capacity to see incomparably
farther and deeper. The African-American---seventh son after the
Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and
Mongolian---possessed the gift of ""second-sight in this American world,""
an intuitive faculty (prelogical, in a sense) enabling him/her to see
and say things about American society that possessed heightened moral
validity. Because he dwelt equally in the mind and heart of his
oppressor as in his own beset psyche, the African-American embraced a
vision of the commonweal at its best. But the gift was also
double-edged---always potentially enervating---because the
African-American only saw him/herself reflected from a white surface, ""a
world which yields him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see
himself through the revelation of the other world."" If it was true that
large numbers (perhaps even a majority) of the race had never thought of
themselves as having such a convoluted, refractive existence, Du Bois's
foray into group psychology was certainly valid for those
African-Americans (like himself) whose cultural backgrounds predisposed
them to hold fast to the values of the dominant class of the dominant
society. In all probability, Sam Hose had had a simpler self-concept,
one uninfluenced by Hegel and more fixed by a common identity based on
color and raw oppression. It is not certain what he would have made of
Du Bois's confident prescription---""This, then, is the end of his
striving: to be a co-worker in the kingdom of culture."" Even as Du Bois
assumed the role as its premier advocate, a definite tension (not quite
a contradiction) existed, therefore, in the Du Boisian affirmation of
the race's soul.

Had Du Bois left double consciousness in this epiphenomenal limbo---as a
sort of non-ego or psychic negative pole (""measuring one's soul by the
tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity"")---the
partial legacy of [Souls]{.epub-i} would have been one of perpetual,
devastated psychic passivity. But Du Bois intended the divided self to
be a phenomenon that was spiritually and socially evolving---one that
would define itself through struggle and attain ""self-conscious manhood""
through ""strife."" The German influences are unmistakable with their
suggestion of materializing spirit and dialectical struggle, the whole
surging process coming to concretion in [das Volk]{.epub-i}---a mighty
nation with a unique soul. It is as though the voices of Schopenhauer
and Sojourner Truth were blended. The divided self was destined to
cohere and to merge, yet, in Du Bois's special vision, ""neither of the
older selves \[shall\] be lost."" Du Bois deeply believed that, in time,
the Negro self would comprehend its true essence and the American self
would become, in turn, more robust. What was apparent contradiction, he
resolved in the following cogent formula:

He would not Africanize America, for America has too much to teach the
world and Africa. He would not bleach his Negro soul in a flood of white
Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world.
He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an
American, without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without
having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly in his
face.[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-36){#cha-36}

The divided self was, of course, not original with Du Bois. The
construct was central to the fiction of Goethe and Chesnutt, two of his
favorite writers. Emerson, another favorite, had used the term ""double
consciousness"" in ""The Transcendentalist,"" the 1843 published lecture in
which he even characterized the dilemma as one in which the ""two lives,
of the understanding and of the soul,... really show very little
relation to each other."" But in [Souls]{.epub-i} the divided self would
not remain flawed, compromised, unstable, or tragic. It would become in
time and struggle stronger for being doubled, not undermined---the sum
of its parts, not the dividend. Du Bois's concept of racial twoness at
the beginning of the twentieth century was profoundly radical. With
millions of Europeans arriving from religious and cultural backgrounds
strikingly dissimilar to earlier immigrant infusions, Anglo-Saxon
Protestant guardians of the established culture recoiled in horror at
the idea that there should be alternative versions of what it meant to
become an American. Du Bois was a decade ahead of the generation of
mainstream younger artists and writers who would express their
disenchantment with the Anglo-Saxon cultural paradigm by celebrating
immigrants and workers, mounting scandal-raising art shows, launching
iconoclastic little magazines, and clamoring for social
revolution.[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-37){#cha-37}

It would be exquisitely fitting if there were some indication that
Santayana had catechized Du Bois in that upper room at Harvard about the
doom of those who fail to learn from the past; but no such evidence
exists. Such admonition was perhaps unnecessary. Those who were gifted
with double vision were able to see dilemmas far in the future. ""Of the
Dawn of Freedom"" begins with Du Bois's lines from the Pan-African
Congress address about the problem of the twentieth century being the
problem of the color line---""the relation of the darker to the lighter
races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the
sea.""[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-38){#cha-38} This problem is
the leitmotif of the book, a problem Du Bois examined from the
perspective of institutions and ideals, and from that of the educated,
the ignorant, the rural hard-pressed, and the urban beleaguered. Based
on ""The Freedmen's Bureau"" in the March 1901 [Atlantic
Monthly,]{.epub-i} ""Of the Dawn of Freedom"" was the strongest academic
piece in the collection and decades ahead of its time. Scholars then
writing of the period condemned the Freedmen's Bureau as an unwise and
maladministered experiment in racial uplift in the South. The general
public blamed it for engendering harmful, unrealistic expectations of
forty acres and a mule among the ex-slaves, as well as for foisting on
the South Yankee schoolmarms with their radical teachings, those
""horsefaced"" secular nuns W. J. Cash would ridicule savagely in [The
Mind of the South.]{.epub-i} Du Bois argued that the bureau was a
revolutionary departure for the nation, an organization whose
achievements on balance were impressive and lasting. ""For a sum of
fifteen million dollarsÂ ... and the dole of benevolent societies, this
Bureau set going a system of free labor,"" he wrote, ""established a
beginning of peasant proprietorship, secured the recognition of black
freedmen before courts of law, and founded the free common school in the
South.""

The lost possibility of a permanent Freedmen's Bureau might have
precluded the wasting problems now racking the South, but Du Bois
conceded that such ongoing federal activism was ""unthinkable in
1870""---too alien to the political culture of a nation committed to
individual initiative and limited government. What is remarkable about
""Of the Dawn of Freedom"" was the political conservatism still present in
Du Bois. Had the South behaved charitably toward the newly emancipated
peasants instead of lashing them back into slavery with Black Codes, not
only would Reconstruction have been unnecessary but, Du Bois believed,
""restricted Negro suffrage"" in the South would have been a solution that
""every sensible man, black and white, would easily have
chosen.""[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-39){#cha-39} Booker
Washington could not have said it better.

""Of the Sons of Master and Man,"" the ninth essay, derived from a 1901
article in the [Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social
Science,]{.epub-i} might have been taken from a speech by Baldwin or
Ogden at a Capon Springs education conference. The focus of the essay
was the history and sociology of racial adjustment in the South---the
exigent need for ""study frank and fair, and not falsified and colored by
our wishes and fears."" Like the Freedmen's Bureau study, this piece
reflected the earlier antidemocratic mindset of an evolving Du Bois. It
saw the old, quasi-feudal South being swamped by new classes thrown up
by industrial exploitation, with southern gentlemen being pushed aside
by Snopeses. Whereas before, the profit motive had been restrained by
hierarchy and paternalism, democracy and competition unleashed it in
full savagery. Power, Du Bois wrote, ""has passed toÂ ... the sons of poor
whites fired with a new thirst for wealth and power, thrifty and
avaricious Yankees, and unscrupulous
immigrants.""[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-40){#cha-40} In its
formulation of southern change in which the fate of both white and black
labor was reduced to the ""cold question of dollars and dividends,"" ""Of
the Sons of Master and Man"" suggested something of the later, arbitral
interpretations of the historian C. Vann Woodward. Woodward, in [The
Origins of the New South,]{.epub-i} saw racial segregation as a late
development imposed by the South's ""new men,"" mostly sprung from the
rednecks. Alluding to that noblesse oblige which he still believed
characteristic of dynastic social structures, Du Bois lamented the
abrupt decline of the planters in language that may have been
embarrassing in later years. Freely acknowledging ""that a partially
undeveloped people should be ruled by the best of their stronger and
better neighbors,"" he firmly stated that, ""if the representatives of the
best white Southern public opinion were the ruling and guiding powers in
the South today, the conditions indicated would be fairly well
fulfilled.""[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-41){#cha-41}

For all his talk of scientific objectivity, some of Du Bois's best
scholarship began with intuition, but in this essay authoritarian
elitism clouded his usual prescience. Like the perceptive Woodward,
later, it did not occur to Du Bois to ask himself if the New South might
not be so new in terms of its dominant class structure. Subsequent
scholarship would show that a surprisingly large number of race-baiting,
rabble-rousing leaders of the period were sons and cousins of the
planters and colonels of old. Along with its jarring references to
Jewish merchants in the South (""the Jew is the heir of the slave-baron,""
Jews are ""shrewd and unscrupulous foreigners""), ""Of the Sons of Master
and Man"" had a good deal of the regressive Du Bois in it, as well as the
evolving civil rights radical. Here was a striking example of that
""provincial and narrow thinking"" one of his future collaborators noted
about Du Bois's early ideas about class and
politics.[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-42){#cha-42}

The two essays ""Of the Black Belt"" and ""Of the Quest of the Golden
Fleece,"" numbers seven and eight in the collection, were adaptations of
a long [World's Work]{.epub-i} article lacking somewhat in tightness of
prose. But, taken with ""Of the Meaning of Progress,"" the elegy to
Josie's pastoral time warp, they succeeded in reconstructing a culture
and its institutions---the rural South---that were as mysterious to most
early twentieth-century readers as Livingstone's Africa. Not since
Frederick Law Olmsted crisscrossed the region before the Civil War,
graphically recounting its inefficient productivity, its isolation and
ignorance, the sparse luxury even among its seigneurs, and the ubiquity
of stunted human and natural potential, had there been such a cogent
blend of detailed observation and generalization. Du Bois made certain
that the sociological novelty of these essays was evident, stating in
""Of the Quest of the Golden Fleece"" that readers could ""only learn by
intimate contact with the masses, and not by wholesale arguments
covering millions separate in time and space."" Roaming forlorn counties
and peering into crowded cabins, describing people in misery and misery
in people, the visual prowess of the writing drew Du Bois's readers
deeper and deeper into ""their daily lives and longingsÂ ... their homely
joys and sorrowsÂ ... their real shortcomings and the meaning of their
crimes!"" ""The keynote of the Black Belt is debt,"" Du Bois wrote simply.
""The county is rich, yet the people are poor."" ""The single great
advantage of the Negro peasant is that he may spend most of his life
outside his hovel, in the open fields,"" he noted. A short train ride
brought Du Bois to the regions largest town. Albany, Georgia, in the
heart of the Black Belt, ""six days in the weekÂ ... looks decidedly too
small for itself, and takes frequent and prolonged naps. But on Saturday
suddenly the whole county disgorges itself upon the place, and a perfect
flood of black peasantry pours through the place."" Riding back to
Nashville on the Jim Crow car, he pondered the meaning of his
meanderings: ""all this life and love and strife and failure---is it the
twilight of nightfall or the flush of some faint-dawning
day?""[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-43){#cha-43}

More yet of the subsisting world of slavery was revealed in his original
essay, ""Of the Sorrow Songs."" Du Bois confessed that he knew little of
music but ""something of men."" What he wrote has for the most part stood
the test of scholarship, primarily, no doubt, because academic
appreciation of the spirituals was for a long time indebted to his
pioneering excursion into the sociology of this music---the ""great
serviceÂ ... in his unforgettable chapter,"" which the learned humanist
Alain Locke would extol in his own essay on the spirituals. The
once-heated debate about the origins of the spirituals---African or
Puritan hymns---might have been briefer had the perceptive analysis of
Du Bois's essay been more widely accepted. Distributing his ten master
songs along a developmental continuum from Africa to white America, he
identified four stages: African music; Afro-American music (slave
music); a new form---""a blending ofÂ ... Negro and Caucasian""; and,
finally, mainstream music ""distinctively influenced by the slave songs.""
The sorrow songs were, paradoxically, songs of hope, Du Bois explained,
expressive of ""a deep faith in the ultimate justice of things.""

A few lines more and the reader is no longer following a discussion of
folk music, for Du Bois used the meaning of the sorrow songs to make a
transition to the subject of racial destiny. Sounding a chord he would
replay again with more vibrato in his later books [The Negro,
Darkwater,]{.epub-i} and [The Gift of Black Folk,]{.epub-i} he scoffed
at European presumptions of racial superiority as the ""arrogance of
peoples irreverent toward Time and ignorant of the deeds of men."" A
thousand years ago, there were solid grounds for dismissing the
possibility ""of the blond races ever leading civilization."" Arriving
before the [Mayflower,]{.epub-i} the African in America had sung his
sorrow in the key of the Zeitgeist, Du Bois proclaimed. ""Around us the
history of the land has centered for thrice a hundred years."" Not only
have they fought for and built this country, the final essay in [The
Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i} claims for black folk the perfection
""through our song, our toil, our cheer, and our warning"" of the real
meaning of Justice, Mercy, and Truth among a ""headstrong, careless
people.""[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-44){#cha-44} The shade of
Crummell and the argument of ""The Conservation of the Races"" filled the
closing paragraphs.

Contrary to what Du Bois later claimed, the initial conflict with
Washington had been professional and then bitterly personal before it
became ideological. Ideological estrangement and the fundamental and
enduring rift it created among African-Americans was more in the nature
of a consequence rather than a cause. The Du Bois--Washington
controversy began with differences in emphases, suspicions and
insinuations, and, above all, with doctrinal shaping and hardening in
the force fields of two antithetical egos. As Du Bois certainly
understood, [The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i} not only ""settled pretty
definitely any further question of \[his\] going to Tuskegee as an
employee,"" but it also forced him to embrace fully both the logic and
the politics of opposition to the philosophy behind Tuskegee. Arranged
as the third essay, ""Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others"" made
[Souls]{.epub-i} a contemporary bombshell. Readers of [Dial]{.epub-i}
were familiar with the essentials of the argument, as articulated in the
measured 1901 review of [Up From Slavery,]{.epub-i} but, in its
expanded, honed form, this was virtually a new piece
altogether.[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-45){#cha-45}

Epigraph lines from Byron---""From birth to death enslaved; in deed,
unmanned!""---set the essay's ironic tone. There was a much fuller
account of the evolution of African-American leadership, initially
centered on the free people of the North. Du Bois mentions ""Forten and
Purvis of Philadelphia, Shad of Wilmington,"" and ""Du Bois of New Haven,""
his grandfather. The Civil War and its aftermath produced a combined
leadership class of older free spokespersons and the newly manumitted,
but, until the ascendancy of Washington, according to Du Bois, all had
been selected ""by the silent suffrage of their fellows, had sought to
lead their own people alone, and were usually, save Douglass, little
known outside their race."" Unlike these, the Wizard was the celebrity
born of a single event, the instantaneous wonder of an afternoon's deed
more acclaimed by the other race than by his own. He was leader ""not of
one race but of two""; the most outstanding southern leader since
Jefferson Davis, which only naive readers would have mistaken for a
compliment. Vocational education and racial conciliation were recipes
for advancement antedating Booker Washington, Du Bois stressed, citing
the experiments of the AMA and the politics of black North Carolinian J.
C. Price. What the Wizard had done, however, was to link vocationalism
and accommodationism, to ""put enthusiasm, unlimited energy, and perfect
faith into this program, and changed it from a by-path into a veritable
Way of Life."" ""Thus, by national opinion, the Negroes began to
recognize"" the Wizard's primacy. Very soon, ""the voice of criticism was
hushed.""[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-46){#cha-46}

The Wizard's creed was an old one of submission combined with an almost
religious materialism. It was one, Du Bois warned, that ""practically
accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races"" as part of a bargain
of timid, circumscribed advancement. And its triumph was extraordinary:
""In the history of nearly all other races and peoples the doctrine
preached has been that manly self-respect is worth more than lands and
houses..., that a people who surrender voluntarily such respect, or
cease striving for it, are not worth civilizing."" Washington would have
his people renounce three means of empowerment: political power, civil
rights, and higher education. History, Du Bois asserted, offers no
example of possible progress through such concessions. If the
African-American masses had fallen down on the job in terms of work
ethic and morality, white America must not be allowed to dodge its part
of the blame for ""the relentless color-prejudice \[that\] is more often
a cause than a result of the Negro's
degradation.""[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-47){#cha-47}

Du Bois readily conceded that the men and women in his own camp
applauded Washington's emphasis on thrift, practical education, and
property. They recognized the South's special economic and demographic
complexities. As realists, they knew that ""the free right to vote, to
enjoy civic rights, and to be educated will \[not\] come in a moment.""
But they were ready to declare war on all those who justified the
South's degradation of the Negro as well as those who claimed that ""the
prime cause of the Negro's failure to rise more quickly is his wrong
education in the past."" Finally, Washington's attempt to silence those
whom he could not command compounded the misunderstandings and the sharp
divergences. Other views must be heard, Du Bois commanded. He and others
had ""no right to sit silently by while the inevitable seeds are sown for
a harvest of disaster to our children, black and
white.""[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-48){#cha-48} ""Of Mr. Booker
T. Washington and Others"" was the manifesto of the Talented Tenth, a
turn of phrase to be found, however, only once in the collection---in
the sixth essay, ""Of the Training of Black Men."" The precise meaning and
significance of this pivotal term was outlined that same year in another
collection of essays compiled by a now unidentifiable white editor, [The
Negro Problem: A Series of Articles by Representative American Negroes
of Today,]{.epub-i} where Du Bois wrote, ""The Negro race, like all
races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men."" In that seminal
essay, ""The Talented Tenth,"" Du Bois posed a rhetorical question in
order to give a definitive answer to the role of class dynamic in racial
progress: ""Was there ever a nation on God's fair earth civilized from
the bottom upward? Never; it is, ever was, and ever will be from the top
downward that culture
filters.""[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-49){#cha-49}

The fifth [Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i} entry, ""Of the Wings of
Atalanta,"" offered readers a deeper insight into the politics and social
beliefs of the leaders for whom Du Bois spoke. Their names would become
more familiar once the Du Bois-Washington controversy really got under
way. He identified a few of them---John Hope; Archibald and Francis
GrimkÃ©; Kelly Miller; John Wesley Edward Bowen of Gammon Theological
Seminary in Atlanta; Bishop Benjamin Tucker Tanner of the AME Church;
Paul Laurence Dunbar; and novelist Charles Waddell Chesnutt of
Cleveland. Among the women he failed to mention, who would soon enter
the ranks, were Ida Wells-Barnett; Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, still
the uncompromising integrationist; Mary Terrell; Lugenia Hope; and a
young high school teacher Jessie Redmon Fauset. Strong-willed and often
hair-splitting, the camp was never ideologically in sync, especially
when it came to gaining the cooperation of key players like Monroe
Trotter and Wells-Barnett, both of whom would cause Du Bois almost as
much heartburn as they did Washington. Dunbar, Du Bois's friend from
Wilberforce days, had personal and medical troubles that prevented
anything more than the use of his name in the service of the cause. The
short, natty mathematician and philosopher Miller, then perhaps Howard's
most distinguished faculty member, would show an enraging propensity for
standing simultaneously with both sides in the
controversy.[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-50){#cha-50}

These men and women were defined by the specifics of their class
background and, to a somewhat lesser degree, the region in which they
made their living. Born between 1855 and 1875, most were urban
northerners (whether originally from elsewhere or not), descended from
relative affluence or privilege, college-educated, and engaged in the
professions. Doctors, lawyers, undertakers, preachers, and teachers,
with a smattering of businessmen, civil servants, and journalists, they
were known as ""quality folk,"" ""representative Negroes,"" people whose
parents had made a successful go of it in slavery times and had family
silver to go with their genteel manners. Numerically, they were not
significant in a population of more than nine million---perhaps several
hundred hard-core families in the North and several dozens in the South.
Nor did the majority of those who matched the Talented Tenth profile
consider themselves part of the movement Du Bois and his handful were
spearheading. Most of them were intimidated by the Tuskegee Machine's
power to make and break careers. Amherst and Harvard graduate William H.
Lewis and Harvard man Roscoe Conkling Bruce were among the more
prominent who fell prey. Even the GrimkÃ©s sometimes waffled. But there
were also those like Harry Thacker Burleigh, the gifted,
conservatory-trained composer, or Hugh Browne, the Princeton-educated
Philadelphia high school principal, for whom Washington's program simply
made more common sense than any
other.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-51){#cha-51} Those whom the
profile of family, education, profession, region, and urban dwelling fit
were not necessarily members of the Talented Tenth, therefore; but those
who were members fit the profile. A far more accurate characterization
would have been the Talented Hundredth.

A good deal of their growing opposition to Booker Washington was
visceral, simply a matter of who they were and who he was. Few of them
doubted that by virtue of breeding and accomplishment they merited equal
social treatment with their white peers. The suggestion that they should
soft-pedal their personal abilities and civic prerogatives, patiently
waiting for the lot of the black masses to improve, was extremely
distasteful to them. Even when they commended parts of the Tuskegee
program, in their well-appointed parlors and high-toned churches, they
spoke with condescension. Although the National Negro Business League
idea interested and engaged numbers of them, at bottom they dismissed
the Wizard's conjurings as fatalistic hoodoo for southern peasant
consumption and sophisticated Uncle Tomism for ruling whites. In the
last paragraph of ""Washington and Others,"" Du Bois clearly voiced their
elitist, cosmopolitan tones of mockery. ""So far as Mr. Washington
preaches Thrift, Patience, and Industrial Training for the masses,"" they
were ready, said Du Bois, to ""hold up his hands and strive with him,
rejoicing in his honors and glorifying in the strength of this Joshua
called of God and of man to lead the headless
host.""[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-52){#cha-52} But in ""Of the
Wings of Atalanta"" Du Bois went on to speak to and for the deepest
concerns of his class, protesting Washington's turning the black world
upside down so that the starring roles went to peasant farmers, skilled
mechanics, and domestics, forcing the Talented Tenth offstage. The
models venerated in the past had read a number of inspirational books
beyond the Bible; many were widely traveled; some had even thought
deeply; and most had pretended, at least, to think nobly. Yet how often
and effectively had they been mocked by the Wizard onstage and in Park
Avenue mansions. ""Into their places are pushing the farmers and
gardeners, the well-paid porters and artisans, the businessmen---all
those with property and
money.""[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-53){#cha-53}

The true spelling of this progress, Du Bois might have written, was
Mammon, the commercialization of ideas and institutions by white and
black people who knew only how to fix prices but nothing about values.
The feelings of the men and women to whom Du Bois appealed were akin to
those of genteel white Protestants witnessing with mounting resentment
and alarm the new American social order that was suddenly, bumptiously
emerging at the turn of the century. If the concept of status anxiety
had validity, then the Talented Tenth experienced it as farmers,
preachers, peddlers, grocers, and hairdressers formed up behind the
Wizard for a march into prosperity. Refinement of person, concern for
the quality of success, dignity before expediency---these were
attributes as much at a discount in the Tuskegee ideology as in that of
Republican boss Mark Hanna or financier J. Pierpont Morgan. ""In an age
of unusual economic development,"" the Wizard was bound to be hailed as a
sage, Du Bois granted, his ""gospel of Work and Money"" completely
overshadowing ""the higher aims of
life.""[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-54){#cha-54} The prospect
was too dismal to accept as inevitable, nevertheless, and Du Bois hoped
in the next breath for a more balanced outcome.

In that regard, he wrote next of Atalanta (Atlanta), hub of the
spreading, corroding compromises that have made ""material prosperityÂ ...
the touchstone of all success."" But ""the hundred hills of Atlanta are
not all crowned with factories,"" he reminded readers. There was hope for
both the white South and the black South through its colleges and
universities, vital enclaves from which ""a few white men and a few black
men of broad culture, catholic tolerance, and trained ability"" would
annually infiltrate the region's ""social unrest and commercial
selfishness."" Du Bois celebrated the idea behind Atlanta University,
Fisk, and Howard. Whatever the naivete and errors of their Yankee
founders, ""they were right when they sought to found a new educational
system upon the University: where, forsooth, shall we ground knowledge
save on the broadest and deepest
knowledge?""[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-55){#cha-55} Higher
education was the grounding of the Talented Tenth, the certification of
their worth, and, as such, it was a privilege of their class that was
non-negotiable in the final analysis.

year. By October 1903, McClurg's was selling about two hundred copies
weekly of a second edition and remitting royalties to Du Bois at the
rate of fifteen cents per copy. Five years after publication, 9,595
books had been sold. For a controversial work about African-Americans by
an African-American, such sales were exceptional, and, by any measure,
the book enjoyed an impressive run. The London firm of Constable
published a British edition in the spring of 1905 and Max Weber's
expectation that there would soon be a German translation was still very
much alive.[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-56){#cha-56} Despite

hurried to his writing desk to tell Du Bois, ""More than ever do I feel
that God has raised you up at this juncture in our history, as a race,

Talented Tenth of the mother continent came congratulations on Du Bois's

A Cornell University English major, who had written previously seeking
advice about her summer school studies, was enraptured. Jessie Fauset, a
third-year student from one of Philadelphia's oldest African-American

that had graduated a mere handful of women, thanked Du Bois ""as though
it has been a personal favor."" She was ""glad, glad"" he wrote it. ""We
have needed someone to voice the intricacies of the blind maze of
thought and action along which the modern educated colored man or woman
struggles."" Fauset ended on a personal note (as she would many times in
the future): ""It hurt you to write that book, didn't it?"" for she knew
so well that ""the man of firm sensibilities has to suffer exquisitely,
just simply because his feelings are so
fine.""[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-59){#cha-59} Here was an
admirer with whom Du Bois decided he should become much better
acquainted.

Like the Bookerite press, most southern white newspapers pretended not
to notice [The Souls of Black Folk.]{.epub-i} Those that did claimed,
like the [Tennessee Christian Advocate,]{.epub-i} not to know what to
make of the book or the author. The Nashville [American,]{.epub-i}
however, was sure of one thing: ""This book is indeed dangerous for the
negro to read."" The reviewer for the Houston [Chronicle]{.epub-i}
unmasked the author's terrible design and demanded the authorities
indict Du Bois for ""inciting rape."" Southern coverage of his book was
about what Du Bois would have expected, but the wide attention paid to
it outside the South was sometimes just as obtuse or mean-spirited. To
admit that its arguments were persuasive, that its eloquence was moving,
was to risk destabilizing the entente cordiale between the North and the
South, an admission that could lead to fundamental reexamination of the
dogmas and policies underpinning the racial status quo. The editors of
[The New York Times]{.epub-i} took no chances. They chose a white
southerner whose anonymous review conceded that [Souls]{.epub-i} was
interesting and even deserving of praise here and there. The book's
fatal flaw, nonetheless, was that its author was a sophisticated
northerner with only a superficial understanding of southern black
people and of the history of the South. Du Bois's hidden personal
agenda, the [Times]{.epub-i} reviewer disclosed, was simply to be able
to ""smoke a cigar and drink a cup of tea with the white man in the
South."" Mrs. Elia W. Peattie harbored the same suspicion in her lengthy
[Chicago Tribune]{.epub-i} review. Having discharged her obligation to
the status quo, however, Peattie allowed her professional conscience to
speak about ""this passionate book, incomplete and sometimes
self-conscious though it is,"" a book compelling ""profound respect. It is
a real, not an imitation
book.""[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-60){#cha-60} Joseph
Pulitzer's New York [World]{.epub-i} agreed with Mrs. Peattie about the
caliber of the writing and the searing honesty of the author.

But neither [Collier's Weekly]{.epub-i} nor [The Outlook]{.epub-i}
faltered in their duty to uphold [Plessy v. Ferguson]{.epub-i} and the
Atlanta Compromise. [Collier's,]{.epub-i} the muckraking weekly par
excellence, dismissed concerns about the black man's soul. ""With
sufficient food, drink and warmth, the negro is happy, come what may.""
When an offended Du Bois upbraided [Collier]{.epub-i}'s editor, Richard
L. Jones, for the magazine's racial stereotyping, the latter feigned
hurt puzzlement, claiming ""not to know just what particular article or
statement has appeared in our paper to cause this offense."" More serious
in its concerns, [The Outlook]{.epub-i} of May 23, 1903, reviewed
[Souls]{.epub-i} along with Washington's [The Future of the American
Negro,]{.epub-i} didactically rehearsing the latter's program of solid,
slow, practical advancement and warning of the dangers of Du Bois's
impatience and impertinence. The Atlanta professor was ""half ashamed of
being a negro, and he gives expression to his own bitterness of soul in
the cry which he puts into the mouth of his race."" The black person must
learn not to ""think about yourself. Do not think about your woes and
wrongs. Meditate not on the 'souls of black folk,' but on 'the future of
the American negro,'"" it
counseled.[[61]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-61){#cha-61}

With so much calculated, critical misunderstanding, Du Bois needed to
know that there were white men and women among what he called the
""better classes"" who were giving [Souls]{.epub-i} a fair reading.
Sending brother Henry a copy that June of the volume by ""a mulatto
ex-student of mine,"" William James complimented Du Bois that year on
writing a ""decidedly moving book."" Robert Hunter, the well-known social
worker, future author of [Socialists at Work,]{.epub-i} and a thinker Du
Bois admired, compared [Souls]{.epub-i} to [Uncle Tom's Cabin,]{.epub-i}
while Washington Gladden was positively rhapsodic. Called the ""father of
the Social Gospel,"" and currently president of the AMA, Gladden deplored
[The Outlook's]{.epub-i} disapproving review. ""I want you all to read
it,"" he thundered from his Sunday pulpit in Columbus, Ohio. ""It will
give you, I think, a deeper insight into the real human elements of the
race problem than anything that has yet been written."" The sometimes
grumpy Albert Hart loved it. Fourteen years later, he was still
insisting that his finest Ph.D. student's collection was ""the only
literature published by a Harvard graduate in forty
years.""[[62]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-62){#cha-62}

Over the next few years, as [Souls]{.epub-i} went through additional
printings, it retained its capacity to move readers of different racial,
religious, and social backgrounds. From New York's squalid Lower East
Side, D. Tabak, a new American, would share with Du Bois his epiphany
after a chance discovery of [Souls]{.epub-i} ""upon a book shelf in a
corner of Delancy \[sic\] Street."" The young Russian immigrant wrote of
being ""overpowered by a peculiar pain that was so much akin to bliss.""
Tabak's words fairly tumbled off the page as he confessed that he was
""ashamed of being white,"" of now envying the ""despised and abused."" He
found it unbearable to be a citizen of a country in which 10 percent of
the population was persecuted and ""denied all rights a thousand times
more cruel than we Jews are in
Russia.""[[63]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-63){#cha-63} In closing,
Tabak thanked Du Bois for the greatly heightened sense of humanity and
""sympathy to all nature's children"" he had derived from [The Souls of
Black Folk.]{.epub-i}

When Professor W. D. Hooper of the University of Georgia, an old-stock
American at the opposite end of the social scale from the Russian Jew,
got around to reading the book in the fall of 1909 he would write
immediately to tell Du Bois how profoundly moved he was---""but even the
pure English was very refreshing in this day of slovenliness."" Hooper
was ashamed that the South had fallen from the control of its ""best
people."" The problem was ""the problem of the lower class whites,""
against whom, Hooper sighed, he and his kind were ""utterly powerless.""
Having long grieved about the treatment of Du Bois's people, the
professor was racked with despair that he could find no way to alleviate
the situation. But upon reflection, he decided that in a small way he
had been able to contribute. He begged his fellow academic to know that
his own ""skirts are at least clean. I have never wittingly wronged one
of your race in any way."" Hooper added that he had raised his son to
respect black men and women. Appreciative of the moral tumult Hooper
must have experienced in bringing himself to write, Du Bois would reply
that he had been touched by the letter, which he had read ""again and
again with increasing sympathy."" But with Du Bois sympathy was seldom
confused with absolution. ""Comrade,"" he admonished, ""you and I can never
be satisfied with sitting down before a great human problem and saying
nothing can be done. We must do something. That is the reason we are
here on Earth.""[[64]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-64){#cha-64}

Challenging letters like the one Du Bois received from Caroline H.
Pemberton were rare. This lucid northern white woman shared her thoughts
very soon after McClurg and Company released [Souls.]{.epub-i} After
praising his eloquence and insights, she gently chided Du Bois for
failing to see that race hatred was a camouflage for class warfare. He
did ""not seem to be aware that the white laborers of the North are
facing the same alternative of starvation---or submission and unceasing,
unrecompensed toil."" Another serious failing, she thought, was Du Bois's
embrace of the culture and civilization of the white man. ""What he
boasts of as 'civilization' is a hideous
mockery.""[[65]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-65){#cha-65} Pemberton's
letter seems to have played a part in quickening Du Bois's appreciation
of the possibility of solidarity across racial lines among black and
white workers. The theme of class conflict was shortly to be heard, if
faintly, in an article or two and an occasional speech.

Meanwhile the New York [Evening Post]{.epub-i} and [The Nation]{.epub-i}
(both owned by Oswald Garrison Villard) had broken ranks with the
pro--Booker Washington press. The unsigned review running in both
publications had all the earmarks of Villard, until then counted among
the Wizard's firmest supporters. Unlike Baldwin or Ogden, Villard
permitted himself to doubt that the Tuskegee program was a panacea. A
race whose leaders' education was largely limited to masonry and
accounting Villard saw as a race unfitted for the modern world. Did it
really make sense to renounce civil rights in the present on the
assumption that they would be hauled up some day by cast-down buckets?
Here was a ""profoundly interesting and affecting book,"" infused with
intellectual passion and unquestionable knowledge of the character and
ideas of black people, said the [Evening Post]{.epub-i} reviewer.
Perhaps its criticism of Washington went too far; yet, upon reflection,
the reviewer conceded that Du Bois's charges deserved ""the carefullest
consideration.""[[66]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-66){#cha-66}

The liberal and influential [Independent,]{.epub-i} while also troubled
by the presentation of Washington, decided that [Souls]{.epub-i} was
""the best and most logical expression of the clear facts of race hatred
yet made by any student of the negro
question.""[[67]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter11-67){#cha-67} This was a
review with which Du Bois found himself in complete agreement. He knew
that the triumph of [Souls]{.epub-i} lay in its luminous presentation of
the minds of thinking black folks. For the first time in the brutal,
mocked, patronized, and embattled history of Negro life on the North
American continent, there was now a revelation of the race's social,
economic, and psychological realities and prospects of such lyricism,
lucidity, and humanity as to leave its mark on a white America guilty of
evasion, obfuscation, and hypocrisy.

P[OSTLUDE TO THE]{.epub-sc} F[UTURE]{.epub-sc}

T[HE ANNOUNCEMENT]{.epub-sc} of W.E.B. Du Bois's death came just after
Odetta finished singing, a mighty trumpet of a voice that had
accompanied the nonviolent civil rights movement from early days. Roy
Wilkins, executive secretary of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), broke the news in his precise
Midwestern voice that always reminded you of a proper Protestant pastor
or one of the older men behind the counter at Brooks Brothers, From late
morning into mid-afternoon, the scalding sun and suffocating clamminess
had exacted their toll from more than 250,000 men, women, and young
people who crowded the length of the Reflecting Pool of the nation's
capital in response to the charge of Asa Philip Randolph, the moving
force behind the March On Washington. Tall, white-maned, and as ebony as
an African chief's walking stick, Randolph, the grand old man of civil
rights, had summoned Americans to Washington that twenty-eighth day of
August, 1963, in all their professional, social, and ethnic variety to
act, as he said in his cathedral baritone, as ""the advance guard of a
massive moral revolution for jobs and
freedom.""[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-1){#cha-1}

Before Wilkins's brief, epochal announcement, speaker after speaker had
stepped up to the altar of microphones to music and song by Joan Baez;
Peter, Paul, and Mary; Pete Seeger; Marian Anderson; and Mahalia
Jackson. As the sun blazed down, the marchers witnessed a who's who of
America's civil rights, religious, and labor leadership. Eugene Carson
Blake of the National Council of Churches, with a speech too dry for
this evangelical occasion, was followed by young John Lewis of the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), whose speech in its
original draft, threatening to lay waste to the white South, had brought
down upon his militant head the collective wrath of the civil rights
elders and Cardinal Patrick O'Boyle of the Washington archdiocese. Lewis
finally agreed to soften his words, but not by much, and the crowd
cheered when he intoned, ""Listen, Mr. Kennedy, listen, Mr. Congressman,
listen, fellow citizens---the black masses are on the march for jobs and
freedom, and we must say to the politicians that there won't be a
'cooling-off' period."" The United Automobile Workers' ebullient Walter
Reuther almost matched Lewis's cautionary rhetoric, telling a nation on
guard against Soviet imperialism that it could not ""defend freedom in
Berlin, so long as we deny freedom in Birmingham."" Then came Floyd
McKissick of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) to read James
Farmer's powerful speech. Had Farmer not insisted on staying in jail in
Plaquemine, Louisiana, his baritone delivery would surely have made eyes
water and pulses rise even more than the intense McKissick succeeded in
doing. Whitney Young, Jr., the handsome, gregarious new head of the
National Urban League (NUL), was more at home in the boardrooms of
corporate donors than in trying to stir crowds, and his too-rapidly read
message showed it.[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-2){#cha-2} When
Matthew Ahmann of the National Conference for Interracial Justice (NCIJ)
used up his ten minutes in moral generalities, the thermometer stood at
eighty-two humid degrees and attention spans evaporated.

Now Roy Wilkins was at the microphone, to be followed by Rabbi Joachim
Prinz of the American Jewish Congress. But instead of beginning his
prepared address straightaway, he opened by saying that he was the
bearer of news of solemn and great significance. Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois was
dead. He had died in his sleep around midnight, on the twenty-seventh,
in Ghana, the country of his adopted citizenship. ""Regardless of the
fact that in his later years Dr. Du Bois chose another path,"" Wilkins
told the suddenly still crowd, ""it is incontrovertible that at the dawn
of the twentieth century his was the voice calling you to gather here
today in this cause."" The NAACP head asked for silence, and a moment
almost cinematic in its poignancy passed over the marchers. Saddened,
though unsurprised by Wilkins's announcement, Rachel Davis Du Bois (""the
mother of inter-cultural education"") wondered aloud at that moment if Du
Bois's spirit, ""now free from his body, in some mysterious way might
have hovered in our midst."" Unrelated by ties of blood or marriage to
the legendary old icon, she had known and loved him deeply much of her
life. Jim Aronson, another white Du Bois stalwart, would write in [The
Guardian,]{.epub-i} a socialist weekly, of an aged, black woman in the
crowd weeping, ""'It's like Moses. God had written that he should never
enter the promised land.'""[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-3){#cha-3}
Aronson left unsaid what all who had known him at the end understood,
that Du Bois had finally concluded that this weeping woman's promised
land was a cruel, receding mirage for people of color. And so he had
chosen to live out his last days in West Africa.

Legendary Dr. Du Bois (for few had ever dared a more familiar direct
address) appeared to have timed his exit for maximum symbolic effect.
Someone had told the actor Sidney Poitier and the writers James Baldwin
and John Killens the news while they were standing with several others
in the lobby of Washington's Willard Hotel early that morning. ""'The Old
Man died.' Just that. And not one of us asked, 'What old man?'"" Killens
recalled.[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-4){#cha-4} In a real sense,
Du Bois was seen by hundreds of thousands of Americans, black and white,
as the paramount custodian of the intellect that so many impoverished,
deprived, intimidated, and desperately striving African-Americans had
either never developed or found it imperative to conceal. His chosen
weapons were grand ideas propelled by uncompromising language. Lesser
mortals of the race---heads of civil rights organizations, presidents of
colleges, noted ministers of the Gospel---conciliated, tergiversated,
and brought back from white bargaining tables half loaves for their
people. Never Du Bois. Not for him the tea and sympathy of interracial
conferences or backdoor supplications, hat in hand and smile fixed, in
patient anticipation of greater understanding or guilt-ridden,
one-time-only concessions. From an Olympus of scholarship and opinion,
he waved his pen and, as he wrote later, attempted ""to explain, expound
and exhort; to see, foresee and prophesy, to the few who could or would
listen."" Many, many listened, and one who did, Percival Prattis, the
aggressive editor of the influential Pittsburgh [Courier,]{.epub-i}
wrote proudly at the time of the Old Man's McCarthy-era trial as a
foreign agent, ""They could not look at him and call me
inferior.""[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-5){#cha-5}

Born in Massachusetts in the year of Andrew Johnson's impeachment and
dead ninety-five years later in the year of Lyndon Johnson's
installation, William Edward Burghardt Du Bois cut an amazing swath
through four continents (he was a Lenin Peace Prize laureate and his
birthday was once a national holiday in China), writing sixteen
pioneering or provocative books of sociology, history, politics, and
race relations. In his eighties, he found time to finish a second
autobiography and produce three large historical novels, complementing
the two large works of fiction he wrote in the first two decades of the
twentieth century. The first African-American to win a Harvard
doctorate, he claimed later that it was a consolation for having been
denied the few additional months needed to take a coveted doctorate in
economics from the University of Berlin. The premier architect of the
civil rights movement in the United States, he was among the first to
grasp the international implications of the struggle for racial justice,
memorably proclaiming, at the dawn of the century, that the problem of
the twentieth century would be the problem of the color line.

Du Bois was one of the founders of the NAACP and the fearless editor of
its monthly magazine, [The Crisis,]{.epub-i} from whose thousands of
heated pages scholarship, racial propaganda, visionary pronouncements,
and majestic indignation thundered and flashed across Afro-America and
beyond for a quarter of a century. In its peak year, the magazine
reached one hundred thousand devoted subscribers. Professor, editor, and
propagandist, he was also once a candidate for the U. S. Senate, and, at
least until the last decade of his Promethean life, civil rights role
model to an entire race. In its transcendence of place, time, and,
ultimately, even of race, his fabulous life encompassed large and
lasting meanings. Always controversial, he espoused racial and political
beliefs of such variety and seeming contradiction as to often bewilder
and alienate as many of his countrymen and women, black and white, as he
inspired and converted. Nearing the end, Du Bois himself conceded
mischievously that he would have been hailed with approval if he had
died at fifty. ""At seventy-five my death was practically
requested.""[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-6){#cha-6}

Wilkins was into his speech now, mincing no words about the ""sugar
water"" of civil rights proposals of the Kennedy administration. As the
ovation for the NAACP secretary died down, Mahalia Jackson electrified
the great crowd with ""I've Been 'Buked and I've Been Scorned."" A few
minutes later, at 3:40 [P.M.]{.epub-sc} on that catalytic August day,
Martin Luther King, Jr., the new shepherd of the 'buked and scorned,
soared into one of the noblest speeches in the history of the American
republic. Meanwhile, in Accra, Ghana, preparations for the elaborate
state funeral were already well along that Wednesday, before the
planet's network-television eyes turned away from the March On
Washington at 4:30 [P.M.]{.epub-sc} Osagyefo President Kwame Nkrumah of
the Republic of Ghana had commanded that the farewell for his friend and
teacher, the Father of Pan-Africa, be movingly splendid. The Osagyefo
was the second African to take command of a state south of the Sahara
(even seasoned Africa watchers routinely forgot that the leader of the
Sudan had assumed his duties in January 1956, more than a year before
Nkrumah); his title was a self-created one derived from the Akan
language, roughly meaning ""Redeemer."" With 300 million pounds sterling
in its treasury and the most educated population in the sub-Sahara,
Ghana's ruler advertised his republic of seven million as the lodestar
of black Africa, the beacon for independence and unity throughout the
continent. The state funeral for W.E.B. Du Bois on Thursday afternoon,
August 29, 1963, was meant to celebrate and symbolize Ghana's claim to
Pan-African leadership.

The body lay in state in the spacious, white bungalow at 22 First
Circular Road. It was a long barge of a house, a gift of the Ghana
government, moored gently in Shirley Graham-Du Bois's flourishing
garden. This was the second Mrs. Du Bois, musicologist, novelist,
playwright, former American Communist Party (CPUSA) activist, now in her
fifty-seventh year of tempestuous willpower and talented improvisation.
A handsome African-American woman of fair complexion and features
strongly imprinted by Native American ancestry, her take-charge
personality, piercing eyes, and prominent nose made her seem even
handsomer and taller than her five feet two
inches.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-7){#cha-7} From 10:00
[A.M.]{.epub-sc} until 2:00 [P.M.]{.epub-sc} on the twenty-ninth,
Shirley Graham-Du Bois had received those coming to pay final respects.
Efua Sutherland, a tall, cocoa-brown woman of great beauty, arrived to
console and stayed to help with the last-minute oversights of such
occasions. She was the director of the Ghana Drama Society and had
brought William Branch, a young black American actor and free-lance
journalist with her. Branch's coverage of the funeral in Harlem's
[Amsterdam News]{.epub-i} would be a trove of detail. A broad spectrum
of the diplomatic corps (but no one from the embassy of the United
States), officials of the Ghana government, representatives from
state-supported academic and cultural organizations, and many people
from the large resident African-American community came to offer
condolences, to express what the widow's husband had meant to the world,
to Ghana, or simply to themselves, and to gaze silently for a few
seconds upon the remains in the bronze casket. Du Bois lay deep in his
burnished vessel, bronzed flesh encased in bronzed metal, cravated and
light-suited, his features even more refined in death, the finely
spheroidal cranium and trimmed Wilhelmine mustache and goatee completing
the effect of assured
apotheosis.[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-8){#cha-8}

The script for the last rites called for a triple ceremony of
leave-taking: first, in the bungalow, largely among close family friends
and a few persons of position in government, diplomacy, and the
burgeoning cultural community of the capital; a second, public and
photographed, on the grounds of the compound beneath a thatched,
stone-pillared gazebo that had been completed too late for the deceased
to enjoy in the evenings; and a final march and symbolic fanfare among
thousands by the ocean. Shortly after two, a general's signal sent a
detachment of infantry in full dress to enter the rear of the bungalow.
Shirley Graham-Du Bois stood silently, comforted by Efua Sutherland and
others, as the soldiers entered in lockstep, closed the lid of the
coffin, and removed it to the red-carpeted gazebo. The coffin, resting
on a silver catafalque, was reopened. Four soldiers in crimson jackets,
heads bowed, rifles reversed, stood beside each pillar. Above the body
lying in serene repose, a Chinese lantern glowed and, occasionally,
swayed slightly.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-9){#cha-9}

By then, the grounds of the bungalow were packed with the grieving and
the curious. Men, women, and children of all classes---market women,
cabinet ministers, and Europeans---reverently filed past the bier. The
easy fellowship of the day was underscored by a pennanted Rolls-Royce
gliding up to disgorge Prime Minister Hastings Banda of Nyasaland, an
energetic little man who self-importantly acknowledged greetings as he
bounded through the crowd into the gazebo. President Nkrumah was
convinced that such freewheeling contact with his own people was too
dangerous. A bomb in a potted plant in a far-north place called
Kulungugu had nearly killed him the year before. Shortly before 3:00
[P.M.]{.epub-sc}, therefore, the commissioner of police ordered the
compound cleared. Fellowship gave way to maximum-security autocracy in a
wail of sirens and backfiring motorcycles as a behemoth Russian Chaika
limousine arrived. (There were only three of these machines in the
country---Nkrumah's, the Du Boises', and the Soviet ambassador's, whose
country's gift they were.) The leader of Ghana, a trim, slight man with
a polished forehead, descended briskly, wearing his customary frown of
deep concentration. He was dressed in a black, impeccably tailored
version of the Nehru jacket, now his signature on state occasions.

As Nkrumah strode down the red carpet to the gazebo, Mrs. Graham-Du
Bois, in black dress and veiled hat, descended the steps of the bungalow
to greet him. She leaned slightly upon the chief of state's left arm as
they approached the casket together. Nkrumah stood head bowed for three
minutes. Then, solemnly, he placed his right hand upon Du Bois and
allowed something of the moment's deep emotion to play across his face.
Shirley Graham-Du Bois followed, repeating the gesture, her tender
expression of the moment before giving way to one of ineffable grief.
The stillness was broken by what the [Evening News]{.epub-i} described
as the chanting of a ""state linguist"" (the witch doctor of mocking
Europeans) pouring a traditional libation upon the ground and asking God
in Akan ""to lead Africa's son into the next world."" The newspapers tell
us that ""at that precise moment,"" rain fell in sheets, an unmistakable
sign to Ghanaians that the gods hid granted Du Bois citizenship in their
world. Nkrumah briskly returned to his limousine, under an attendant's
umbrella. As he drove away, the rain stopped as suddenly as it had
come.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-10){#cha-10}

Precisely on the hour, the chief of the defense staff of the Ghanaian
army and the commissioner of police presented themselves to Mrs.
Graham-Du Bois. Saluting crisply, they informed her that the caisson and
military honor guard stood ready to transport her husband from the
Cantonments Residential Area (once the preserve of the occupying
British) to the grounds of the Old Government Printing Office on 28th
February Road. Army pallbearers began sealing the coffin, lacing the
red, gold, and green colors of Ghana around it, then hoisted it atop a
howitzer gun carriage drawn by a black Land Rover. On the one-mile drive
to the staging area, Shirley sat deep in the rear plush of the Chaika
that had given her husband so many hours of pleasure and contemplation.
Following several cars back with Efua Sutherland, William Branch
wondered to himself how his own country's officials could behave so
pettily, as the cortege passed the American embassy and he caught sight
of its staring personnel and the Stars and Stripes at full staff in
front.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-11){#cha-11} Within a few
minutes, they reached the Old Government Printing Office where the
funeral parade would assemble.

Thus it was that a few minutes after 3:00 [P.M.]{.epub-sc}, in keeping
with the punctuality always insisted upon by Nkrumah, the bronze casket
began the final leg of its ceremonious journey. To Nkrumah---who
approved as the American title of his life story, [Ghana: The
Autobiography of Kwame Nkrumah]{.epub-i}---a sense of history and of
occasion were second nature. ""Arrangements for the Burial of Dr. W.E.B.
Du Bois"" were intended to advertise abroad and to enhance at home, with
solemnity and pageantry, the reality of an African nationhood still
being consolidated.[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-12){#cha-12} ""O
God, Our Help in Ages Past"" filled the heated air as the trombones and
tubas of the Central Army Band followed behind the Chaika and the
slow-moving caisson. Next came two double columns of elite infantry in
gold-braided tunics of crimson---rifle stocks reversed and cradled in
underarm position---executing the distinctive, ceremonial glide, the
famous Slow March, learned from British drillmasters. The three-thirty
sun spangled off medals won during the Ghana army's participation in the
United Nations peacekeeping action in the former Belgian Congo. The
[shh-wutt-shh-wutt]{.epub-i} of the Slow March and the mournful notes of
the band funneled through the great arch at Black Star Square, where
several thousand hushed onlookers watched from bleachers under skies now
blown blue and clear of clouds.

Castle Osu, old Christiansborg, sits on a spit of land less than fifty
yards from the Atlantic, one of the half dozen stone holding-pens built
along the coast by Portuguese, Danish, and Dutch slave traders. For the
Europeans, the gold of the old Gold Coast had become, by the beginning
of the sixteenth century, not mineral but animal. Few sacks of gold dust
were ever stored in Portugal's infamous SÃ£o Jorge d'El Mina Castle (""the
Mine"") one hundred miles west southwest of Accra. Instead, a ghastly
collaboration had come to pass as the smart, corner-cutting Fanti people
of the coast leapt at the opportunity to enter into the European
spiderweb market of rum, cloth, trinkets, firearms, and chattels
gradually interlacing four continents. For four hundred years, African
slave magnates fed several million black men, women, and children to El
Mina, Christiansborg, and the other grim, dank coastal entrepots from
Senegal to Angola that supplied the rapacious Atlantic slave trade.
Between ten and fifteen million people are estimated to have been
shipped out of Africa between 1450 and 1860, and millions of them surely
came from the Gold
Coast.[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-13){#cha-13} But all this was
now understood to be part of a history best left to historians. For the
people of postcolonial Ghana, Castle Osu symbolized, in its
reincarnation as the residence of their head of state, the reassertion
of sovereignty and the resolve to become players on the modern world
stage.

So, with fitting ceremony, the people of Ghana took their Pan-African
Moses down to the sea, to entomb him just outside the white walls of
looming Castle Osu. The [Ghanaian Times]{.epub-i} would wax
conventionally metaphorical the following morning about ""that enigma of
a fighter, that phenomenon of a sage, sleep\[ing\] the long sleep in a
spot that symbolizes his true return to the home of his
ancestors.""[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-14){#cha-14} Yet his
burial in the soil of Ghana meant much more than that, as Nkrumah
certainly knew and intended his people to appreciate over time. It
implied mitigation of African peoples for collusion in slavery---not
through alibi or justification but through a recognition that, in
selling Du Bois's ancestors into bondage, the Africans who had profited
were, in reality, no more free than those who ended up on auction
blocks. The message of Karl Marx delivered by Du Bois to all Africans,
as to the rest of the less-developed world, was that the market economy
perfected in northern Europe always made the weak weaker---and most of
the strong weaker.

Du Bois had shaped and launched upon the rising tide of
twentieth-century nationalisms the idea of the solidarity of the world's
darker peoples, of the glories in the forgotten African past, of the
vanguard role destined to be played by Africans of the diaspora in the
destruction of European imperialism, and, finally, as he grew older but
more radical, of the inevitable emergence of a united and socialist
Africa. Master of seductive syntheses of scholarship and prophecy, only
Du Bois would have serenely foretold, but a few months into the din of
the guns of August 1914, that ""a belief in humanity means a belief in
colored men"" and that the ""future world will, in all reasonable
probability, be what colored men make it."" In what were virtually his
last words of warning, he had written that a ""body of local private
capitalists, even if they are black, can never free Africa; they will
simply sell it into new slavery to old masters
overseas.""[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-15){#cha-15} Du Boisian
Pan-Africanism, then, meant enormously more than the ethnic romanticism
of roots traced and celebrated. It signified the militant,
anticapitalist solidarity of the darker world.

Standing before the starkly white walls of Castle Osu, Ghanaian
ambassador plenipotentiary Michael Dei Anang read Du Bois's ""Last
Message to the World,"" composed six years earlier in the deceased's
Brooklyn home. As he read, eight bareheaded officers threaded ropes
underneath the gleaming casket in preparation for its final descent.
Speaking through Dei Anang's clipped British accent, the old sage told
the world that he had ""loved people and my play, but always I have been
uplifted by the thought that what I have done will live long and justify
my life; that what I have done ill or never finished can now be handed
on to others for endless days to be finished, perhaps better than I
could have done.""[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-16){#cha-16} Among
the honorary pallbearers was an unusually tall, gaunt, and handsome
African-American whose priestly bearing and ideological fervor had
earned him the rare honor of intimate collaborator and de facto editor
of the Great Man's last large undertaking, the [Encyclopaedia
Africana,]{.epub-i} funded by Nkrumah's government through the Ghana
Academy of Sciences. Alphaeus Hunton, once professor of literature at
Howard University, intended to devote the remainder of his life to this
monumental work whose creator was being lowered into the ground to the
bugled notes of the Last Post.

Wreaths were laid, first for the president and Mrs. Graham-Du Bois, and,
one by protocol one, by portly Chief Justice Sir Arku Korsah; towering
Liberian ambassador George Flamma Sherman; bespectacled chief of the
ruling Convention People's Party (CPP), N. A. Welbeck; writer Julian
Mayfield, representing the African-American community; and, finally, by
a phalanx of army officers for national, continental, and foreign
organizations. The president's farewell message was read over Ghana
Broadcasting that night a few hours after Martin Luther King described
his incandescent dream in another time zone. The Osagyefo must have been
deeply moved when writing his speech. It was plain yet vibrant, and as
the Ghana Broadcasting announcer read of shared experiences and plans,
something of Nkrumah's sense of personal loss entered his own voice. ""I
knew him in the United States and even spoke on the same platform with
him,"" Nkrumah boasted of his days as a university student in America.
(Du Bois had had to be rather carefully reminded of the occasion years
later.) The greatest scholar the Negro race had produced became a ""real
friend and father to me,"" Nkrumah continued. He had asked Dr. Du Bois to
""come to Ghana to pass the evening of his life with us."" The president's
radio apostrophe ended after a few more phrases with a perfect
summation: ""Dr. Du Bois is a phenomenon. May he rest in
peace.""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-17){#cha-17}

During the next few days, the newspapers would tally the impressive
cable traffic---from J. B. Bernal of the World Peace Council, Gus Hall
of the American Communist Party, Chief Awolowo of Nigeria, Cheddi Jagan
of British Guiana, Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, Ahmad Ben Bella of Algeria,
Kim Il Sung of North Korea. Walter Ulbricht of the now dismantled German
Democratic Republic wished that ""the memory of Dr. Du Bois---an
outstanding fighter for the liberation and prosperity of
Africans---continue to live in our hearts."" The cables from Mao Tse-tung
and Chou En-lai were lengthy but less formulistic than most of the
others, reflecting the political and personal camaraderie that had been
so much advertised during the Du Boises' two sojourns in China. Chou
En-lai's farewell fittingly summed up the course and meaning of his
friend's near hundred-year odyssey as ""one devoted to struggles and
truth-seeking for which he finally took the road of thorough revolution.
His unbending will and his spirit of uninterrupted revolution are
examples for all oppressed peoples."" Expressing his sense of loss,
premier Nikita Khrushchev wrote Shirley Graham that her husband's
""shining memory"" would stay forever ""in the hearts of the Soviet
people."" The day after the state funeral, the [Ghanaian Times]{.epub-i}
carried a moving front page editorial under the Akan headline, ""NANTSEW
YIE!"" (Farewell!). The following day, the rains came again, heavily and
steadily.[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter1-18){#cha-18}

R[ISE OF]{.epub-sc} [T[HE]{.epub-sc} C[RISIS]{.epub-sc}]{.epub-i},
D[ECLINE OF THE]{.epub-sc} W[IZARD]{.epub-sc}

T[HE MOVE]{.epub-sc} from Atlanta to New York, from the classroom in
ivy-covered Stone Hall to an editorial desk in Villard's [Evening
Post]{.epub-i} building at 20 Vesey Street, Du Bois always regarded as
the fork in his career leading from science to propaganda. The problem
of the twentieth century impelled him from mobilizing racial data to
becoming the prime mobilizer of a race. It was the great sacrifice
forced upon him by a world vastly more atavistic beneath its surface
culture and modernity than he had dreamt possible as a young scholar. At
age forty-two, a series of ugly incidents and unfair developments had
pushed and pulled him, he explained repeatedly, to forsake the tower for
the platform, monographs for editorial columns: Sam Hose's severed
knuckles on display in a Mitchell Street grocery; the Ogden express
figuratively rushing past Atlanta University on its way to Tuskegee;
Carnegie Institution funds for a Mississippi planter while the Atlanta
Studies went begging; Teddy Roosevelt dishonoring a battalion of
decorated soldiers---and, no matter what the legerdemain or outrage,
always there was the imperturbable Booker T. Washington ready with a
disingenuous explanation. Yet, if, as he rightly said, ""this fact of
racial distinction based on color was the greatest thing in my life and
absolutely determined it,"" the shift from science to
propaganda---however disjunctive professionally---was also supremely
suited to Du Bois's temperament and
talent.[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-1){#cha-1} As a very young
man, and then many years later, he confessed to wanting to be a
novelist, and he would, of course, write a number of works of fiction,
as well as some poetry. This Apollonian social scientist was also a born
Dionysian prophet, left-handed, deeply intuitive, creative, and
mystical. If Du Bois's new career represented a sacrifice, it was also a
gift.

He arrived at Vesey Street determined to try out an idea that some
members of the executive committee thought was impractical to the point
of folly---a national monthly magazine. The name for it, ""Crisis,"" came
either from Ovington or Walling one early August afternoon as the three
sat planning the magazine's life in suite 610 of Villard's new Viennese
Secessionist building with its elaborately detailed, copper mansard
roof. James Russell Lowell's poem ""The Present Crisis"" was the
inspiration. The skeptical Albert Pillsbury warned Du Bois from Boston,
""periodicals are as numerous and as pestilential nowadays as flies were
in Egypt, and most of them meet with the very same
reception.""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-2){#cha-2} A militant
civil rights journal, edited by an African-American primarily for
African-Americans, appeared no more likely to find a sufficient number
of subscribers than would a block of preferred Standard Oil securities
in the new Harlem. [The Moon]{.epub-i} had died in its earliest phases
and [The Horizon,]{.epub-i} after much clamor about the Milholland
merger, was fast receding. ""From a talk with Murray, I gather we are
about at the end of the row,"" Hershaw had sighed in early April,
although the magazine would run for another three months during 1910. Du
Bois's editorial success rate thus far fully justified Pillsbury's
prognosis. Nor did the NAACP possess funds for a publication; as Villard
told Du Bois his first morning on the job, ""'I don't know who is going
to pay your salary; I have no money.'"" From the would-be editor's point
of view, nevertheless, the office space provided by Villard and his
provisional support of the enterprise were more critical at that stage
than the money. [The Crisis: A Record of the Darker Races,]{.epub-i}
edited by W. E. Burghardt Du Bois, ""with the cooperation of Oswald
Garrison Villard,"" conveyed cachet and implied gold-plated publishing
experience.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-3){#cha-3} Most likely,
Villard backed Du Bois's [Crisis]{.epub-i} scheme because he intended to
be as much a force behind it as he had been behind the National Negro
Committee. If so, this was, of course, a monumental miscalculation on
his part.

""On November 1st there will appear the first number of a new monthly
called [The Crisis,]{.epub-i}"" Du Bois's prospectus announced in
mid-September. Five thousand subscribers were needed in order to insure
its success. ""For this reason the subscription is put at the nominal
price of One Dollar."" His publication was to fulfill several functions:
""First and foremost,"" as a newspaper recording ""very important happening
and movement in the world which bears on the great problem of
interracial relations and especially those which affect the
Negro-American""; second, as a comprehensive review ""of opinion and
literature"" pertinent to the race problem; third, as a forum for ""a few
terse"" articles; finally, the editorial page, mainly though not
exclusively animated by Du Bois, standing ""for the rights of men,
irrespective of color or race, for the highest ideals of American
democracy."" Along with Villard and Russell, the prospectus boasted the
impressive credentials of contributing editors Kelly Miller, ""an author
and critic,"" Max Barber, ""formerly editor of the [Voice of the
Negro,]{.epub-i}"" William Stanley Braithwaite, a poet and writer of
""international reputation"" (Braithwaite, an African-American, was poetry
editor of the Boston [Transcript),]{.epub-i} and Mary Dunlop Maclean, ""a
staff writer on the New York [Times]{.epub-i}""---an editorial board made
up of two white men and one white woman, and three black men. A special
meeting of the executive committee, on September 6, had approved Du
Bois's magazine as ""the organ of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People,"" with the proviso that the editor submit
to all the committee members the copy for the first
number.[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-4){#cha-4} Having to supply
copy far enough ahead of the publication deadline was the least of the
editor's worries, since he wrote nearly all of it himself.

To a ""young English woman,"" as he referred to Mary Maclean, Du Bois owed
""more than I can say"" for technical help and long hours. Maclean had
been born and raised in the Bahamas. Ovington, who was a competent judge
of the profession, called her one of the best women journalists of the
day. Somehow Maclean continued to write full-time for the Sunday edition
of the [Times]{.epub-i} while serving as tireless managing editor of
[The Crisis.]{.epub-i} She had been stirred by the first National Negro
Conference and had gone to Russell to volunteer her talents. Her
colleagues came to call her ""Miss Sunbeam"" because she brought such
unflagging buoyancy to the work in Vesey Street. Du Bois owed a great
deal as well to the firm of Robert N. Wood (""we print for the
[Vogue]{.epub-i} Magazine and refer by permission to Mr. CondÃ©
Nast""---spelled ""Nash"" in the first issue) for breakneck delivery at a
price reduced by the cost of an ad in [The Crisis.]{.epub-i} Wood was an
African-American printer well-connected to Tammany
Hall.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-5){#cha-5} [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} went on sale at the beginning of November 1910 at ten
cents a copy, a sixteen-page volume ten inches high, backed by a
one-year, fifty-dollar-a-month line of credit voted by the NAACP
executive committee.

The culmination of Du Bois's brand of militant journalism, [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} actually traced its lineage from Frederick Douglass's
[North Star]{.epub-i} and William Garrison's [Liberator]{.epub-i} back
to the first newspaper in North America published by persons of African
descent, Samuel Eli Cornish and John Russwurm's [Freedom's
Journal.]{.epub-i} Garrison's iron rectitude and Douglass's unbending
dignity can be said to have infused [The Crisis,]{.epub-i} but part of
its inspiration came from the polemical voice of Fortune of the
[Globe]{.epub-i} and [Freeman,]{.epub-i} in Du Bois's Great Barrington
youth a model of intrepid civil rights activism but now a fallen angel
in the kingdom of
Tuskegee.[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-6){#cha-6} On the cover of
the inaugural issue was the smudged figure of a black child of
undetermined gender, probably drawn by Du Bois, holding a hoop in the
right hand and a stick in the other. Madame E. Toussaint's Conservatory
of Art and Music (""The Foremost Female Artist of the Race"") purchased a
full page on the reverse side of the cover, a lifeline ad for the
magazine, as was real estate broker Philip A. Payton's full-page ad for
""New York's Pioneer Negro Real Estate Agents,"" the company that had
driven a wedge into white Harlem. L. C. Smith & Bros. Typewriters of
Syracuse, New York, took another full page for some reason. The Henry
Phipps Model Tenements for Colored Families bought half a page.
Marshall's Hotel on West Fifty-third Street, ""The Leading Colored
Restaurant in America,"" placed a quarter-page ad, and so did the Nyanza
Pharmacy, ""the only colored Drug Store in New York
City.""[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-7){#cha-7}

The agenda and tone of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} were set by Du Bois's
introductory editorial stating its firm intention to set forth ""those
facts and arguments which show the danger of race prejudice."" Its name
came from the fact that the editor ""today believes that this is a
critical time in the history of the advancement of men."" No clique or
party would sway the magazine, Du Bois continued, and ""personal rancor
of all sorts"" would be avoided (a promise often unkept). The format of
the first [Crisis]{.epub-i} would be more or less constant in succeeding
issues over the next four years: ""Along the Color Line,"" with its
subsections on topics such as politics, education, social uplift,
organizations and meetings, science, and art; ""Opinion,"" a canvass of
the press and representative correspondence; ""Editorial,"" with
subsections; a large section varying each month from coverage of NAACP
business to essays on various topics; ""The Burden,"" for coverage of
civil, economic, political, and literal atrocities against
African-Americans; and ""What to Read."" ""Talks About Women"" and ""Men of
the Month"" were added in December 1910 and May 1911,
respectively.[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-8){#cha-8}

The November [Crisis]{.epub-i} invited readers to contemplate two racial
infamies---one a lynching by a mob, the other a presidential hanging. Du
Bois's editorial on the lynching of two swarthy Italians (recently
naturalized) in Florida dripped with irony. ""The inalienable right of
every free American citizen to be lynched without tiresome investigation
and penalties is one which families of the lately deceased doubtless
deeply appreciate."" In ""Athens and Brownville,"" Moorfield Storey
recounted the 1904 rampage in Athens, Ohio, by fifty or more soldiers of
the 14th Battery of U. S. Artillery who had sprayed bullets into Main
Street as they marched on the city jail to liberate a comrade. Although
a militiaman was killed and two or more civilians wounded, manipulation
of the evidence by the War Department's representative, who denounced
the prosecution, resulted in the sentencing of a single soldier to a
year in prison and the fining of another. ""Here the facts were clear,""
the distinguished constitutional authority noted, ""but the guilty men
were white."" Both incidents had occurred during Roosevelt's watch. ""Why
did he not apply the same rule in both
cases?""[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-9){#cha-9}

In ""Along the Color Line,"" readers of the first Crisis learned of the
election in South Carolina of Governor Coleman Blease on a platform
endorsing prohibition and opposing Negro education; of the founding of
an organization to promote the Democratic party, the United Colored
Democracy of New York State; of President Taft's nomination of the
distinguished Tennessee African-American lawyer-politician James C.
Napier to the post of register of the United States Treasury; of ""about
\$400,000 from the Dolger bequest"" to Tuskegee; and of a French
anthropologist's report of ""powerful Negro empires of great size and
some culture exist\[ing\] in the Sudan before the white races entered
Africa."" There was detailed news of the founding of the NAACP at the
second annual conference on the Negro, along with horror stories under
""The Burden"" about the association's intervention in the Pink Franklin
and Steve Greene peonage
cases.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-10){#cha-10}

Pink Franklin, an illiterate South Carolina tenant farmer, was the
nation's current object lesson in peonage. He had been speedily tried
and sentenced to death for killing a white sheriff who had crashed into
his house at night to arrest him for leaving his landlord's farm. After
the state supreme court decreed that it saw nothing amiss in the trial
and sentence (that no lynching had occurred was proof enough of due
process), Milholland's Constitution League persuaded former U.S.
attorney general Charles J. Bonaparte to prepare Franklin's case for the
Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Villard's [Evening Post]{.epub-i} and Hayes's
[Independent]{.epub-i} transformed Pink Franklin's case into a cause
cÃ©lÃ¨bre during the spring of 1910. Two weeks after the second annual
National Negro Conference, Villard wrote Uncle Francis of the ""terrible
blow"" delivered by the U.S. Supreme Court. Dodging the peonage question
at the heart of the case, it had upheld the South Carolina
decision.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-11){#cha-11} Ten weeks
later, as Villard, Ogden, and Washington worked behind the scenes to
have Franklin's death sentence commuted to life imprisonment, Steve
Greene, an illiterate tenant farmer, staggered out of Chicago's railroad
terminal with bullets from his white Arkansas landlord's pistol still
imbedded in his neck, arm, and leg. Greene was another black man whose
gall in refusing slave wages had ended in the killing of a white man.
Extradited to Arkansas, where a Crittenden County lynch committee
awaited him at the depot, Greene was saved when Wells-Barnett's Negro
Fellowship League secured a writ of habeas corpus, offered a
hundred-dollar reward to any Illinois sheriff intercepting Greene and
his Arkansas deputies, and then rallied a defense committee. Steve
Greene finally reached safety in
Canada.[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-12){#cha-12} Curiously, Du
Bois's coverage of the dramatic events behind Greene's removal from the
clutches of his Arkansas warders omitted any mention of Wells-Barnett
and her Negro Fellowship League.

The ""Opinion"" column assembled representative views on important
questions of the day from prominent African-American leaders, many of
whom, of course, saw eye-to-eye with the editor. ""What to Read,"" which
would evolve from a laundry list of recommended titles to annotations
and concise reviews, alerted subscribers to the existence of more than a
dozen magazine articles (four dealing with India and three with Africa)
and thirteen books, four of them on Africa, one of them in French, and
one, [Three Lives,]{.epub-i} by Gertrude Stein. In light of the
earthquake that his editorial writings on racial integration would set
off thirteen years later, Du Bois's pronouncements in the first issue
deserve attention. ""Some people,"" the editor alleged, without specifying
names or race, in Chicago, Philadelphia, Columbus, Ohio, and a number of
other northern cities, were promoting separate public schools for
African-American children. This was wrong, and must not be. ""Separate
them by color and they grow up without learning the tremendous truth
that it is impossible to judge the mind of a man by the color of his
face. Is there any truth that America needs to learn
more?""[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-13){#cha-13}

[The Crisis]{.epub-i} was to be more like a rocket than Pillsbury's
Egyptian flies. It came ""at the psychological moment,"" a triumphant Du
Bois exclaimed, ""and its success was phenomenal."" With the first issue
of a thousand selling out completely (a George Wesley Blount of Hampton,
Virginia, was the first subscriber), he doubled the number of pages in
the December Crisis and increased the printing to 2,500. This issue
carried ""Talks About Women,"" a segment written by Mrs. John Milholland,
which broadcast Du Bois's commitment to women's causes and contributed
to a boost in sales. It also included Franz Boas's second annual
conference paper, a highly significant demolition of the pseudo-science
surrounding racial differences. Booker Washington would have expected to
be noticed, and he was not disappointed. The items column of the first
[Crisis]{.epub-i} contained a straight-faced comment on the Wizard's
recent European tour. ""On landing in America, Mr. Washington announced
that the Negroes in the United States were better off than the poor
classes in Europe.""[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-14){#cha-14} A
cheerful book on the subject, [The Man Farthest Down,]{.epub-i} would
issue from the Tuskegee ghostwriters' factory the following year.

That so little ink was expended on Du Bois's adversary in the first
issues was probably because Du Bois's petition denouncing the Wizard,
""An Appeal to England and Europe,"" was still gathering signatures in the
United States. While in London, the Tuskegee principal had assured the
distinguished members of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection
Society that the American race problem was virtually solved. Milholland,
also in London at the time, had contacted Du Bois immediately, urging
him to puncture Washington's hot-air balloon. A long letter from
Milholland had appeared in the September 6 London [Standard]{.epub-i}
dismissing such statements as ""really a farcical declaration were the
background not so ghastly tragic."" Ask W.E.B. Du Bois about the American
race problem, Milholland of the Constitution League challenged, ""this
brilliant graduate of Harvard University, this student of Heidelberg
\[sic\] and member of the International Law Association, the recognized
authority on sociologyÂ ... \[who\] is compelled to travel on a 'Jim
Crow' car from Atlanta to Washington."" Before the Wizard left the
British Isles, Du Bois's rebuttal in the name of the NAACP, and signed
by twenty-three leading African-American men from Barber through GrimkÃ©
and Trotter to Bishop Walters, was being circulated by Milholland. On
December 1, 1910, with the first number of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} still
eliciting widespread comment, ""An Appeal to England and Europe,"" with
nine additional signatories, was published in the New York
[Sun,]{.epub-i} which, like most of the ""white"" press, had ignored the
founding conference of the
NAACP.[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-15){#cha-15}

They were compelled to point out ""that Mr. Washington's large financial
responsibilities have made him dependent on the rich charitable public,""
Du Bois explained to interested Britons. ""He has for years been
compelled to tell, not the whole truth, but that part of it which
certain powerful interests in America wish to appear as the whole
truth."" The truth according to Du Bois was radically different. ""Our
people were emancipated in a whirl of passion, and then left naked to
the mercies of their enraged and impoverished ex-masters."" The history
lesson that followed in ""An Appeal to England and Europe"" was a marvel
of compression, outlining the ""systematic attempt to curtail education,""
the mob violence aroused when ""property in better quarters"" was bought,
the universality of ""lower wages for equal work,"" the cardinal disgrace
to black women in the South ""without protection in law and custom,"" and,
finally, ""worse than all this,"" the systematic miscarriage of justice in
the courts---topics dealt like cards snapped from a deck. Here was a
Talented Tenth manifesto that had, if not world impact, an impact in the
world. In this three-page leaflet, Du Bois crystallized the divisions
between so-called radical and conservative African-Americans.
Washington's performance in Europe was ""like a blow in the face,"" he
charged. ""It is one thing to be optimistic, self-forgetful and
forgiving, but it is quite a different thing, consciously or
unconsciously, to misrepresent the
truth.""[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-16){#cha-16}

""Is a toothache a good thing?"" Du Bois had asked in his first editorial.
It was in any case ""supremely useful"" in warning of decay, dyspepsia,
and death. No issue of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} ever failed to expose its
quota of useful toothaches---such as Du Bois's May 1912 criticism of the
black church. The institution had saved the race in slavery. ""One must
bow with respect"" before it. Yet all was not well with the church. Its
upper ranks were ""choked with pretentious ill-trained men and in far too
many cases with men dishonest or otherwise immoral."" Dishonesty was
compounded by parochialism, the depressing fact that the church was
""still inveighing against dancing and theatregoing, was still blaming
educated people for objecting to silly and empty sermons."" Perhaps not
since the similar reproaches of Martin Delany before the Civil War had a
prominent African-American publicly lambasted the race's one institution
that above all others united millions of men and women of all classes
and regions. Did the memory of ""Pops"" Miller, the grim foe of
Terpsichore who meddled into innocence at Fisk, play a subconscious part
in Du Bois's editorial spleen, long years afterward?

Other shortcomings within the veil were exposed with Du Bois's
characteristic asperity. Wilberforce University, where the editor's old
Negro Academy colleague Scarborough was now serving out an earnest if
routine presidency, was said to be falling almost hopelessly behind the
trends in higher education. The ""New Wilberforce""---the adjacent
institution being supported by state funds---was an object lesson on how
to avoid the lack of vision and paltry funding of the original
Wilberforce. While Scarborough's and the Wilberforce alumni's wounded
protests were being taken seriously by a deeply concerned Villard, Du
Bois raced on to his next target---the formidable black press. Down in
Washington, irascible Calvin Chase's [Bee]{.epub-i} had mocked [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} and its editor as the catspaws of arrogant, powerful
whites. Lobbing the grenade back, Du Bois sneered at the
anti-intellectualism and plain bad grammar not only of the
[Bee]{.epub-i} but of much of the Negro press, challenging it to report
on events other than weddings and murders if it wanted to be taken
seriously by his magazine. Villard and the other white officers were
certain that the association would be engulfed in a firestorm as hostile
editorials flamed up across the country. The [Bee]{.epub-i} sneered at
""Harvardized English."" The less-heated Richmond [Planet]{.epub-i}
advised readers to ignore the ""professional bookworm"" Du Bois. A
gloating [Age]{.epub-i} observed that Du Bois had seriously damaged his
own cause. Moorfield Storey decided that the director of publicity and
research must be deranged, a brilliant mind undoubtedly warped, Storey
wrote Villard, by being ""treated as inferior by many men whom he knows
to be his inferiors.""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-17){#cha-17}
At the annual spring conference in 1914, the NAACP membership would vote
a placatory resolution praising the Negro press and hold its breath.
[The Crisis]{.epub-i} published the resolution but declined to extend
the olive branch itself.

Just as Du Bois said, the success was phenomenal. The January 1911
[Crisis]{.epub-i} (with a fighting-spirit editorial by Jane Addams) sold
3,000, February 4,000, March 6,000. This last carried Mary Maclean's
astonishing Afro-centric essay on the black sources of Egyptian
civilization. The publisher of Villard's [John Brown,]{.epub-i}
Doubleday, Doran & Company, bought a half page in the December 1910
number, as did the publisher of [The Souls of Black Folk.]{.epub-i} By
March 1911, most of the major African-American colleges and universities
would join the growing list of advertisers---Atlanta, Fisk, Howard,
Shaw, Virginia Union---even Wilberforce. Hampton and Tuskegee were not
among them, however. With the addition of ""Earning a Living"" in June
1911, the magazine launched a popular section on Talented Tenth
firsts---inventors, surgeons, psychiatrists, architects, and other
models worthy of professional emulation. With the 1911 anniversary
number, the amateur cover sketches gave way to the handiwork of
professional Washington, D.C., photographer George Scurlock, who
specialized in poised Talented Tenth women, and to fine drawings by New
York artist Louise
Latimer.[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-18){#cha-18} Circulation
would reach 22,500 in April 1912. The editor's year-end financial
statement submitted to the NAACP treasurer would report total sales from
November 1910 to November 1912 of 350,000 copies, generating an income
of \$17,374.51, with a balance of \$242.48 after deducting \$17,132.03
for personnel, printing, shipping, and other costs. Du Bois calculated
that the magazine's future would be secure once circulation reached
50,000.[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-19){#cha-19} For a
two-dollar membership in the association or ten cents an issue, the
editor of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} gave readers exceptional value.

But what made Du Bois's magazine unique was Du Bois himself. Although he
had long ago abandoned belief in a personal deity for a meld of Kant and
Hegel, Du Bois's gospel of race and politics was infused with a mystical
fervor that bordered on the religious. He catechized readers with the
pursuit of Democracy, Justice, and Progress (almost always in
uppercase), achievable only by following a straight path. Pulsating
prose in service to synoptic visions was not to everyone's taste, to be
sure, and that fighting African-American newspaperman known as ""Bruce
Grit"" (John Bruce) spoke for many who found [The Crisis]{.epub-i} ""too
stiff in manner and liv\[ing\] too much in the upper ether."" But as the
oratorio of praise welled higher, minor chords of dissatisfaction
(except among confirmed Book-erites) went largely unheard. Marie Brown,
who married and, according to John Hope, civilized the famous
sociologist E. Franklin Frazier, still spoke of the magazine in her
widowhood as having been ""just like the Bible to me"" as an adolescent.
Which was how literary critic J. Saunders Redding remembered its
reception in his parents' Delaware home, where [The Crisis]{.epub-i}
""was strictly inviolate until my father himself had unwrapped and read
it---oftenÂ ... aloud."" At Livingstone College in Salisbury, North
Carolina, undergraduate student J. E. Aggrey, on the way to becoming one
of West Africa's most influential educators, sent a worshipful letter in
July 1913 begging Du Bois to take him on as a summer intern at [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} (though this appears not to have
occurred).[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-20){#cha-20}

Just as men and women of all races were deeply moved by the passion and
prophecy of [The Souls of Black Folk,]{.epub-i} readers of the magazine
were often forced to face prejudices they would have finessed, but for
Du Bois's edifying wrath and vision of deliverance. Votes for women was
a case in point. For many African-American men of the leadership class,
the issue of votes for women was complicated by unhappy memories of
their nineteenth-century collaboration, and by alienation from the
current suffragist leadership of women like Anna Howard Shaw, president
of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). ""'Do not
touch the Negro problem. It will offend the South,'"" Du Bois quoted her
as saying in the October 1911 [Crisis.]{.epub-i} Despite what he hoped
was a more enlightened position of women such as the imperious Alva
Belmont and Fanny Villard, he feared that ""the war cry is rapidly
becoming 'Votes for White Women Only.'"" As a leading authority on
women's rights, Nancy F. Cott, states, ""the suffrage movement since the
late nineteenth century had caved in to the racism of the surrounding
society, sacrificing democratic principle of the dignity of black people
if it seemed advantageous to white women's obtaining the
vote.""[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-21){#cha-21} The women of
NAWSA and the more radical ones who were about to form Heterodoxy and
the Congressional Union, the founts of mass feminist demonstrations,
also had their own bitter memory of black men who, at the time of the
Fifteenth Amendment, had caved in to the sexism of the surrounding
society in order to win universal manhood suffrage. Du Bois cared
passionately about women's rights and determined to make ""Suffering
Suffragettes"" wince under the plain speaking in [The Crisis.]{.epub-i}
He forced the issue of African-American female membership in NAWSA. Mrs.
Shaw lamely protested that, ""if they do not belong to us,"" it was simply
because African-American women had ""not organized and have not made
application for membership."" When, in 1911, suffragist Martha Gruening
had unsuccessfully sought to introduce on behalf of the NAACP a
resolution calling on the organization to express ""sympathy with black
men and women who are fighting the same battle,"" corresponding secretary
Mary Ware Donnet wrote Du Bois that the Louisville conference had ""not
deemed advisable to include the resolutionÂ ... among those to be
presented to the
convention.""[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-22){#cha-22}

Hammering away at such duplicity of white suffragette officialdom, [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} set itself to educating the sizable number of readers
who, from motives ranging from spite to genuine conservatism, displayed
little or no enthusiasm for female suffrage. The extreme fragility of
African-American men's earning power made for fragile male self-esteem
in face of the reality that, in all but the most fortunate families,
women were compelled to work outside the home at an earlier age and in
far greater percentages than were white women. The editor dropped the
""Talks About Women"" section that he had allowed white women to
monopolize, replacing it in October 1911 with a ""Women's Club""
column---(Afrocentered and written by Mrs. Addie Hunton), to be followed
by a much-discussed September 1912 ""Woman's Suffrage Symposium""
featuring Fanny Villard, Adela Hunt Logan, Mary Terrell, and Martha
Gruening. Framing the debate in dogmatic racial terms, Mary Terrell's
piece, ""The Justice of Woman Suffrage,"" found it ""difficult to believe
that any individual in the United States with one drop of African blood
in his veins can oppose woman suffrage."" Answering the covert thoughts
of many other black men, Du Bois granted that there was ""not the
slightest reason for supposing that white American womenÂ ... are going
to be any more intelligent, liberal, or humane toward the black, the
poor and unfortunate than white men are."" Even so, equivocation on the
issue was unthinkable:

Every argument for Negro suffrage is an argument for women's suffrage;
every argument for woman suffrage is an argument for Negro suffrage;
both are great moments in democracy. There should be on the part of
Negroes absolutely no hesitation whenever and wherever responsible human
beings are without voice in their government. The man of Negro blood who
hesitates to do them justice is false to his race, his ideals and his
country.

Du Bois's outraged reaction to some five thousand mostly white women
being jeered, jostled, and singed by cigarettes in the nation's capital
as they marched down Pennsylvania Avenue, ""Hail Columbia!,"" roared out
of the April 1913 issue of the magazine. ""Again the glorious traditions
of Anglo-Saxon manhood have been upheld!"" While police grappled
ineffectively with the mob, while cavalry rushed from Fort Myer to
restore order in the capital, and ambulances sped dozens of suffragists
to emergency wards, the women pressed on, ""trudging stoutly"" through
their gauntlet. Louts leaped upon automobile running boards, snatching
""flags from the elderly women"" and attempting ""to pull the girls from
their floats,"" Du Bois continued dramatically. What black man would want
to emulate these ""Leaders of Civilization,"" he sneered, these
""magnificently vindicated white men,"" whose message to the other half of
humanity was: ""Beat them back, keep them down; flatter them, call them
'visions of loveliness' and tell them that the place for woman is in the
home, even if she hasn't got a home""? ""Hail Columbia, Happy
Land!""[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-23){#cha-23}

Editorial policy on organized labor and socialism were more complicated.
Du Bois would often attack both, infuriated by a gap between ideals and
reality. ""[The Crisis]{.epub-i} believes in organized labor,"" he
insisted in July 1912. In theory, the fate of the great mass of black
men and women depended on the continued progress of organized labor. The
reality in the United States, however, was first the gradual and then
the accelerated expulsion and exclusion of African-Americans from the
unions. Du Bois's criticism of organized labor paralleled that of the
Socialist leaders Eugene Debs and Daniel De Leon, namely, that in
building up an aristocracy of labor in collusion with capital, Gompers
and his associates in the AFL were trading short-term gain for the
long-term economic impotence of the mass of workers. ""Organized Labor""
appeared in the July 1912 [Crisis,]{.epub-i} more than three months
after the spectacular victory of the Lawrence, Massachusetts, textile
workers over their employers. ""Big Bill"" Haywood's Industrial Workers of
the World (""Wobblies""), the radical union of unions open to all trades
and all races, had channeled the anger of the ethnic work force in
Lawrence into organized, triumphal resistance. Yet even though thousands
of African-Americans flocked to the Wobblies (especially Philadelphia
longshoremen and southern lumber workers), Du Bois said he remained
unimpressed. Possibly, he was less pessimistic at the time, but when he
summed up the significance of the IWW in the [Autobiography,]{.epub-i}
he claimed never to have sung the songs of Joe Hill, ""and the terrible
strike at Lawrence, Massachusetts, did not stir me, because I knew that
factory strikers like these would not let a Negro work beside them, or
live in the same
town.""[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-24){#cha-24}

As far as Du Bois was concerned, then, exceptions to the labor color bar
were superficial and transitory. The strategy of white labor was to
""beat or starve the Negro out of his job if you can by keeping him out
of the union; or, if you must admit him, do the same thing inside the
union lines,"" he charged in ""Organized Labor."" Hence, the ideal of
interracial solidarity became a dangerous illusion in the face of
monopolizing white labor. Labor's ""mission is divine"" when it fights for
humanity, but when it became ""a clique of Americans, Irish or German
monopolists,"" Du Bois thundered, then blacks would inevitably see the
""union white man as their enemy."" If white workers went on strike, then
black workers should cross the picket lines to claim their jobs, for the
white workers deserved ""themselves the starvation which they plan for
their darker and poorer fellows."" Thus spoke the editor for whom the
imperatives of race far outweighed those of economics and class---a
reading of the social order that he would gradually revise but never
reverse. In the late 1930s, he would recognize this zero-sum battle cry
as ""my provincial racialism""---a visceral reaction to a dilemma rather
than a long-term solution to the manipulation of labor by
capital.[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-25){#cha-25}

Likewise, Du Bois applauded the rhetoric of the Socialists and blasted
their politics. They had ""rung truest on the race question in their
theoretical statements,"" he wrote, and his membership in New York Local
Number 1 of the Socialist party attested to their appeal---as well as to
Ovington's influence upon him at this time. He was drawn to the
Socialist party's presidential candidate, a Hoosier of French Protestant
descent, whose command of language and undogmatic espousal of socialism
he found temperamentally and intellectually attractive. Without the
Wilhelmine mustache and goatee, Debs even bore a slight physical
resemblance to an older Du Bois. Du Bois admired Debs's refusal to
address segregated audiences in the South during his presidential
campaigns, writing in [The Crisis]{.epub-i} that ""if it lay in our power
to make him President of the United States we would do
so.""[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-26){#cha-26} Du Bois had voted
for Debs in 1904, but the 1912 presidential election was so crucial to
the declining fortunes of African-Americans that he was convinced that
support of the Socialists was futile. Moreover, he found Socialist party
policy on African-Americans all the more culpable because of its
hypocrisy. Although officially abhorring racism, as long ago as 1903
Debs had articulated the party's position that it could not ""make
separate appeals to all races.... There is no 'Negro problem' apart from
the general labor problem""---a proposition that Du Bois regarded as pure
sophistry. The truth was, when it came to African-Americans, the party's
racial policy was captive of its right wing, led by the Wisconsin
Negrophobe and future congressman Victor Berger. Berger sounded like
Alfred Stone when he talked about African-Americans. Their ""free contact
with the white race has led to further degeneration,"" he argued. Du Bois
saw that the divine mission of socialism, like the labor movement, had
bogged down in color conflict. The Socialists ""teach, agitate and
proselyte, while among ten million Negro Americans they have scarcely a
single worker and are afraid to encourage such workers."" The magnificent
Debs had been wrong, the editor would thunder in the [New
Review]{.epub-i} after the 1912 elections; ""The Negro problem, then, is
the great test of the American
Socialist.""[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-27){#cha-27}

The Negro problem was also the great test of Negro leadership in 1912.
Taft's four years in the White House had been an unmitigated disaster.
What Du Bois called the ""Taft Doctrine,"" contained in the president's
statement that the African-American ""ought to come and is coming more
and more under the guardianship of the South,"" had virtually nullified
what remained of Republican party interest in civil rights. For the
first time in postwar history the 1912 GOP platform was silent on the
Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. With an unprecedented four national
parties contending for the presidency, the editor saw again, as in 1908,
the strong possibility of an arrangement with the Democrats. With the
approach of national elections in the fall, the importance of [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} in molding opinion was broadcast by ads placed by the
Republican, Democratic, and Progressive parties. ""They have done this
out of no love for this magazine,"" Du Bois was proud to point out, ""but
because they needed the publicity which this magazine alone could give
and because they knew that our news columns and editorial pages were not
for sale."" The reelection of Taft was unthinkable, [The Crisis]{.epub-i}
roared. ""In spite of the fact that over 200 Negroes have been publicly
murdered without trial during his administration, the utmost those
10,000,000 black men have elicited from his lips is a hesitating
statement that he is sorry---and helpless."" Declaring that such a man
had ""no business to be President of the United States,"" the editor
explored the Progressive party candidacy of Teddy Roosevelt for a few
exciting weeks during the summer of 1912. Brownsville could never be
forgiven, but Roosevelt's Bull Moose agenda was irresistible to many of
the people around Du Bois. He shared the excitement of Jane Addams,
Henry Moskowitz, Joel Spingarn, Lillian Wald, and Frances Kellor at the
vision of an America working an eight-hour day, a six-day week, without
child labor, and with accident, old age, and unemployment insurance, and
female suffrage. Here was the opening that had not come in 1908 for a
""broad platform of votes for Negroes and industrial democracy,"" the
editor hoped. Addams, Moskowitz, and Spingarn went forth from Vesey
Street with the plank drafted by Du Bois for adoption at the Bull Moose
convention that August:

The Progressive party recognizes that distinctions of race or class in
political life have no place in a democracy. Especially does the party
realize that a group of 10,000,000 people who have in a generation
changed from a slave to a free labor system, reestablished family life,
accumulated \$1,000,000,000 \[in\] property, including 20,000,000 acres
of land, and reduced their illiteracy from 80 to 30 per cent, deserve
and must have justice, opportunity and a voice in their own government.
The party, therefore, demands for the American of Negro descent the
repeal of unfair discriminatory laws and the right to vote on the same
terms on which other citizens
vote.[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-28){#cha-28}

The Progressive convention in Chicago gathered the hosts of
reform---social workers, consumer advocates, muckraking journalists,
suffragists, economists, professors, the aroused middle class of
small-town America---in a crusade of evangelical fervor, pealing out
stanzas of ""Onward Christian Soldiers"" and ""The Battle Hymn of the
Republic."" But African-Americans were excluded from the chorus. At the
end of the day, Roosevelt, who was busily courting southern lily-white
delegates, approved the denial of convention seats to most of the
African-American delegates, and instructed the platform committee to
ignore the Du Bois plank introduced by Spingarn. The candidate ""would
have none of it,"" Du Bois learned. ""He told Mr. Spingarn frankly that he
should be 'careful of that man Du Bois' who was in Roosevelt's opinion a
dangerous person."" Addams, who gave a nomination speech for Roosevelt,
said she had been deeply disturbed by the candidate's obduracy, although
in her memoirs she made no mention of the Du Bois plank, confessing
instead that the plank fortifying the Panama Canal ""was really harder
for me to accept than any other
one.""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-29){#cha-29} The ""New
Nationalism"" had no place for New Negroes.

This time, however, there seemed to be an equally attractive alternative
in Woodrow Wilson's ""New Freedom""---an America where the ""curse of
bigness"" would give way to open competition and Jeffersonian virtue.
Wilson, the Virginia son of a Presbyterian parson, possessed a sense of
destiny at once cerebral and mystical, like Du Bois's. As professor of
political economy and jurisprudence at Bryn Mawr, Wesleyan, and
Princeton, Wilson had given oracular speeches and authored essays and
books that had brought him a national celebrity dreamt of but seldom
achieved by academics. As president of Princeton, he had transformed a
second-rate college (almost despite itself and with a stubborn zeal
foreshadowing the League of Nations controversy) into a great national
university. Elected reform governor of New Jersey in 1910 and now a
presidential candidate, Wilson hinted that, under his inspired
leadership, the Democratic party and the African-American could find a
[modus vivendi.]{.epub-i} His advisors anticipated that, with the
popular Roosevelt appealing to the South, the Democrats would need every
spare vote in order to defeat the Republicans. African-Americans like
Monroe Trotter, Bishop Walters, Max Barber, Byron Gunner, Milton
Waldron, and a handful of other significant race leaders approached
Wilson. As reported in the African-American press and [The
Crisis,]{.epub-i} Waldron's audience was almost too good to be true.
Waldron claimed to have been promised that federal patronage would be
distributed irrespective of color, that a Democratic Congress would be
moderate in race matters, and that Wilson would veto legislation hostile
to African-Americans. Another interview with Wilson in July, at Sea
Girt, New Jersey, reported similar commitments from the candidate.
Villard was able to assure Du Bois that his own conference with Wilson
in Trenton had yielded the encouraging vow to be ""President of all the
people.""[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-30){#cha-30} Du Bois was
made distinctly uneasy when Wilson expressed astonishment at these
published reports, and he grew even more distressed after Wilson
refused, on press secretary William McAdoo's advice, to approve a
clarifying statement Du Bois and Villard sent him in order to publish in
[The Crisis.]{.epub-i} Still, the editor remained hopeful.

It was left to Walters to seal the bargain. As Du Bois remembered the
chain of events, he and Walters spelled out to Wilson the benefits to be
had from a sizable shift of African-Americans from the Republican party
and an unequivocal Crisis endorsement. Walters delivered the message.
There was every likelihood that the competition of three major
parties---Democrat, Republican, and Progressive---would result in a
narrow margin for the victor. Fifty thousand African-American votes
deciding the election was a prospect quickly inducing the Democratic
candidate to send the AME Zion bishop a written pledge. It was Wilson's
""earnest wish to see justice done in every matter, and not mere grudging
justice, but justice executed with liberality and cordial good
feeling.""[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-31){#cha-31} For the
editor, the Walters letter was decisive. Wilson, like Debs, was a
kindred spirit---as a visionary academic, even more so. If this
Virginian had presided over the sole Ivy League institution refusing to
admit African-American students (it had summarily rejected Paul
Robeson's brilliant brother, William), Du Bois rationalized that ""a man,
however, is not wholly responsible for his birth place or his college.""
The editor doubted that the Democrat ""admires Negroes"" and suspected
that Wilson's ideal ""would be a world inhabited by flaxen haired wax
dolls with or without brains."" Still, Thomas Woodrow Wilson was a
gentleman, a scholar, and a man who commanded others to reach for their
better selves. His personality ""gives us hope,"" Du Bois psychologized in
a compelling August endorsement of the Democratic nominee. ""He will not
advance the cause of oligarchy in the South, he will not seek further
means of 'Jim Crow' insult, he will not dismiss black men wholesale from
office, and he will remember that the Negro in the United States has a
right to be heard and
considered.""[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-32){#cha-32} The
measurable part that [The Crisis]{.epub-i} played in some one hundred
thousand African-Americans voting for a Democratic president from the
South remains conjectural, but Du Bois's endorsement clearly represented
a monumental gamble. The first southerner since Zachary Taylor and the
first Democrat since Grover Cleveland entered the White House.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[THE DISTINCTIVE]{.epub-sc} tone of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} was one of
grievance enobled and pride stiffened; a good number of editorials would
have failed to satisfy Barrett Wendell's minimalist composition
criteria. The editor was in the business of arousing and edifying his
audience, of reshaping a race's image of itself, and of serving a
resounding notice to white people of a New Negro in the making. ""I am by
birth and law a free black American citizen,"" was his New Year's
greeting for 1913. Du Bois commanded his people to follow his battered
but unbowed example:

Boldly and without flinching, I will face the hard fact that in this, my
fatherland, I must expect insult and discrimination from persons who
call themselves philanthropists and Christian gentlemen. I do not wish
to meet this despicable attitude by blows; sometimes I cannot even
protest with words; but may God forget me and mine if in time or
eternity I ever weakly admit to myself or to the world that wrong is not
wrong, that insult is not insult, or that color discrimination is
anything but an inhuman and damnable
shame.[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-33){#cha-33}

Booker Washington might deserve much credit for Pink Franklin's
reprieve, announced in the February 1911 [Crisis,]{.epub-i} and even
more for the U.S. Supreme Court's flawed but significant opinion a month
earlier, in [Bailey v. Alabama,]{.epub-i} that peonage was
unconstitutional. Yet somehow his achievements now caused far less
wonderment than in years past. Men and women with proud family lineages,
those trained in liberal arts colleges, newcomers learning to survive in
northern cities, and even many in the South secure enough to have
perspective, reveled in the impatience of the NAACP's director of
research and publicity. Who would freely choose accommodation,
compromise, and cast-down buckets if they could vicariously soar with Du
Bois and say boldly to the Man things only whispered previously? On the
death in 1913 of Robert Ogden, Du Bois pained white philanthropy by
writing unforgivingly that ""a self-helping Negro was beyond Mr. Ogden's
conception. Mr. Ogden looked upon the Negro as an incomplete man. He was
willing to help him and he thought he wanted the Negro to help himself.
But he did not.""[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-34){#cha-34}

Taboos fell like tenpins in [The Crisis,]{.epub-i} even the deadly
delicate one of intermarriage. When Clarence Darrow had called for
nullification of laws banning marriage between the races at the second
annual conference, Villard fretted for several days about adverse public
reaction. The renunciation of social equality was the granite rock upon
which the Tuskegee creed stood. In much of the North as in all parts of
the Bourbon South the conviction prevailed that intimate contact between
the races---eating together, being entertained together, voting
together---would lead to miscegenation as inexorably as the pull of
gravity increased in proportion to mass. ""Social Equality"" was the lead
Crisis editorial in September 1911. A prominent African-American
physician had practically sworn before a white audience in Denver that
his race fully accepted its subordinate social status. Of course we want
full social equality, Du Bois snarled, and all who were too cowardly to
say so ought to have the decency to ""preserve a dignified silence.""
Intermarriage was a question ""colored people seldom discuss,"" Du Bois
commented further in a February 1913 editorial. With ""very few""
exceptions, he expected white and black people in the United States to
marry within their race. The legal right to amalgamate, however, was as
legitimate as any group's preference for bonding with one's own kind.
Thus, the rights of exceptional cases must be defended not only as a
matter of principle but for the sake of exploited women. The Bourbon
South ""would rather uproot the foundations of decent society than to
call the consorts of their brothers, sons and fathers their legal
wives."" Writing with a bluntness almost as shocking to many of his
African-American readers as it was to his white audiences, the editor
railed against social practices reducing ""colored women in the eyes of
the law to the position of dogs. Low as the white girl falls, she can
compel her seducer to marry her.... Note these arguments, my brothers
and sisters, and watch your State
legislatures.""[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-35){#cha-35}

If lynching was not taboo as a topic, the victim was usually portrayed
in the mainstream press as someone owing the lynch mob an apology for
its sadism. How often had Booker Washington not regretted the harm done
by lynching to the morals of the perpetrators? Many racially enlightened
northerners were convinced, as Du Bois had found Ray Baker to be, that
the deplorable practice was rooted in understandable southern white
alarm over the African-American's alleged reversion to barbarism. That
had been old Nathaniel Shaler's argument in the book he wrote shortly
before his death. ""Triumph,"" Du Bois's ironically titled editorial,
might have been called ""Let the Eagle Scream,"" the phrase repeated
throughout the text. Its subject was a lynching barbecue of a deranged
black man in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, that year. No apologies to lynch
mobs were extended. The driving force behind lynching had nothing to do
with black barbarism but everything to do with white supremacy. ""Again
the burden of upholding the best tradition of Anglo-Saxon civilization
has fallen on the sturdy shoulders of the American republic,"" he
mockingly opened this September 1911 piece, going on to detail the
Sunday procession by car and on foot from Philadelphia and Chester
County of thousands of whites pouring out of churches and converging on
the butchered victim's smoking pyre.

""Men and women poked the ashes and a shout of glee would signalize the
finding of a blackened tooth or mere portions of unrecognizable bones.""
According to Du Bois, the victim had been a crazed drunkard who
committed an unpremeditated homicide. ""The point is he was black.
Blackness must be punished. Blackness is the crime of crimes.... It is
therefore necessary, as every white scoundrel in the nation knows, to
let slip no opportunity of punishing this crime of crimes. Of course, if
possible, the pretext should be great and overwhelming---some awful
stunning crime, made even more horrible by the reporters' imagination.
Failing this, mere murder, arson, barn burning or impudence may do.""
America knew her true heroes, he bored in. ""Again, let the eagle
scream!"" The editorial ended with a defiant paragraph anticipating the
wildly acclaimed poem ""If We Must Die,"" written almost a decade later by
the Jamaican radical Claude McKay: ""But let every black American gird up
his loins. The great day is coming. We have crawled and pleaded for
justice and we have been cheerfully spit upon and murdered and burned.
We will not endure it forever. If we must die, in God's name let us
perish like men and not like bales of
hay.""[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-36){#cha-36}

I[F]{.epub-sc} B[OOKER]{.epub-sc} W[ASHINGTON'S]{.epub-sc} duties and
travels kept him from reading each issue of Du Bois's monthly, the
fastidious Emmett Scott unfailingly digested whatever his employer
needed to know, especially the alarming circulation figures. Writing in
July 1911 to Fred Moore, the new owner of what had been Fortune's
newspaper, Washington pressured him to increase the [Age']{.epub-i}s
circulation in order to compete with Du Bois. When the Wizard began
finding large ads for the magazine and the NAACP in black barbershops
about the country, he became alarmed. The positive response within the
leadership community to the ""Appeal to England and Europe"" had been
truly distressing to him. After Villard fobbed off his injured protests
about the mailing of the appeal in NAACP envelopes as an inadvertence,
Washington decided to unleash his troops. An editorial in the Washington
[Bee]{.epub-i} (now in the Tuskegee fold) unmasked Du Bois's plot for
the ""pulling down of Dr. Washington from the high pedestal he occupies.""
The editors allies were called ""a few human jokes who are but
impecunious camp-followers."" Innuendo and outright falsehoods abounded.
The old story fabricated by the Tuskegee Machine that Du Bois had
cravenly stayed away from Atlanta until it was safe to return during the
1906 riot was recirculated. Moore's [Age]{.epub-i}, again making use of
the lethal if unstable Fortune, began a series of quasi-libelous
articles about the editor, with Fortune clucking about routing the
opposition once ""we get done with Dr. Du Bois."" Key lieutenants of the
Machine received their marching orders. The Wizard admonished them that
the NAACP was nothing more than a cover for Villard and Milholland ""to
run and control the destinies of the Negro race through Du
Bois.""[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-37){#cha-37}

Individuals who wavered from the faith were warned. Mary Terrell, who
had signed Villard's call and then had served on the Committee of Forty,
particularly incensed the men of Tuskegee, especially Charles Anderson,
who found Judge Terrell's inability to control his wife shameful.
Washington had once flattered Mary Terrell (who was fluent in German) by
arranging a private introduction at the Waldorf Astoria to the kaiser's
visiting brother, Prince Henry of Prussia. Cultivation of this
articulate, influential club woman was followed by an expenses-paid
visit to commencement exercises at Tuskegee, where Terrell had marveled
at seeing cows milked on stage, construction materials assembled, houses
built and painted, ""and so on down the line."" But now, as she signed
NAACP appeals and even made public speeches in its behalf, the Wizard
wanted her silenced. In a letter to her husband he explained, none too
subtly, that her conduct ""naturally makes it harder for your friends to
help you when the time
comes.""[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-38){#cha-38} Because his
life testified to the power and success that the white world could, when
it chose, bestow on one able black man, Washington genuinely doubted
that his compounding troubles could be due to the initiative of another
able black man. Ego and experience told him that the editor of [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} must be a deputized agent of white mischief, like
himself an accomplished actor who regularly improvised his script but
who never forgot the part the audience expected to see him play. That Du
Bois, although dependent upon white patronage, was as much director as
actor, that he was the dynamo charging a new energy field in American
race relations, was inconceivable to him.

Misconception and panic, then, led Washington to depart from the caution
he usually exercised when dealing with influential white people and to
attack the progressives supporting the NAACP---Ovington, Walling,
Villard, Milholland, and others. Charley Anderson was informed of a
scheme under way in the District of Columbia to jeopardize the
government contracts held by Milholland's International Pneumatic Tube
Company. The Bookerite press, especially the [Age]{.epub-i} and
[Bee,]{.epub-i} began a drumroll denunciation of Villard, causing the
publisher-editor, who had once dismissed Du Bois's
newspaper-manipulation charges, to complain to Moton about ""villainous""
attacks.[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-39){#cha-39} Washington
and Anderson's plans for embarrassing the guests at the January 1911
banquet sponsored by the Cosmopolitan Society of America were cause for
thigh-slapping glee. Despite its imposing name, the Cosmopolitan Club
consisted of only a small group of reformers first gathered together in
1906 by Ovington in her Brooklyn family home to promote interracial
social contacts between the well-bred civic-minded. The Wizard had hoped
for a repeat of the lurid press accounts of the club's 1908 banquet. On
his orders, similar press treatment was manufactured for the 1911
banquet at the Cafe Boulevard, although Anderson reported with
disappointment that this time the [Times, Sun,]{.epub-i} and
[Herald]{.epub-i} inexplicably failed to mention the affair. But the
[World]{.epub-i} served up ""proper sensational headlines"" and the
front-page account in the New York [Press,]{.epub-i} ""Three Races Mix at
Banquet for Man's Brotherhood,"" fully satisfied the master of The Oaks,
whose masterminding of the Cosmopolitan Club scandals was exposed many
years later by his biographer Louis Harlan's detective work. New York
straphangers read in the January 26 edition of the [Press]{.epub-i} that
""white women, evidently of the cultured and wealthier classes,
fashionably attired in low-cut gowns, leaned over the tables to chat
confidently with negro men of the true African
type.""[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-40){#cha-40} Whatever the
[Press]{.epub-i} meant by true African types, Du Bois, in tuxedo and one
of the evening's speakers, was among the banquet's maligned.

Warming for the kill, a few days later the Wizard sent orders to the
[Age]{.epub-i}---""Burn Walling up."" During late February and early
March, the city newspapers covered the sensational breach-of-promise
suit brought against Walling by Miss Anna Bertha Grunspan, a Parisian
seamstress of Russian-Jewish heritage. Offering the letters exchanged
between them in evidence, the dark-haired, well-tailored Miss Grunspan
testified that Walling had courted her in Paris and taken her to Russia
with the promise to bring her brother back with them; then, upon
reaching Paris, Grunspan claimed that the wealthy Socialist had proposed
marriage in the presence of her family, giving her a diamond ring to
seal the pledge. The plaintiff became hysterical in the courtroom and
her mother attempted to assault Walling and his wife when the
defendant's lawyer called for testimony from a witness who claimed to
have information about Grunspan's unsavory conduct. The newspapers
reported the imbroglio in graphic detail. Professing shock that numerous
African-American hostesses had innocently welcomed the NAACP official to
their homes, the March 23 edition of the [Age]{.epub-i} expressed the
hope that ""no colored man or woman will in the future disgrace our race
by inviting Mr. Walling in their home or ask him to speak at any public
meeting.""[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-41){#cha-41}

But Booker T. Washington's own public disgrace began four nights earlier
in the San Juan Hill district of Manhattan. The Great Accommodator had
only just arrived in the city, fresh from a speaking engagement in
Michigan, in order to speak that Sunday at two churches, and had checked
into the upscale Hotel Manhattan. That night, he walked alone to 11Â½
West Sixty-third Street and rang the doorbell of an apartment there.

Receiving no answer, he walked back and forth on the sidewalk in front
of the building for almost an hour before reentering, apparently to try
to locate on the dimly lit register the name of the person he was
seeking. It was an altogether strange outing for Tuskegee's principal.
San Juan Hill was still the preserve of working-class Irish, although
African-Americans, pushing above Fifty-third Street from the notorious
Tenderloin district, had begun to cluster in its tenements since the
1890s. The address to which Washington had come was, as proper folk of
that era were wont to say, decidedly demimondaine. It lay, according to
his biographer, just outside a notorious red-light district but which Du
Bois, who was living nearby, described as a ""neighborhood of high class
prostitutes."" A vaudeville theater stood directly across the street.

Exactly what happened next remained unclear in the tangle of conflicting
testimony and rumor spanning an eight-month period from the March
arraignment of Henry Albert Ulrich to his trial and acquittal in
November 1911 for assault. Two facts were clear: that Washington needed
sixteen stitches to his scalp on the night of March 19 to close a
terrible gash; and, second, that Ulrich, a burly German-American
carpenter, physically attacked the great race leader because he was
convinced that an illicit arrangement had been proposed to a woman he
knew intimately. (Seemingly incredible testimony was given by Mrs.
Ulrich that, when she sashayed with her leashed Pomeranian past the
pacing educator, he had greeted her with ""'Hello, sweetheart,'"" and
looked her ""right in the
face.""[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-42){#cha-42}) A sharp tussle
had occurred in the hallway of the apartment building, spilling out on
to the sidewalk with Ulrich allegedly slashing Washington repeatedly
with a bystander's cane. Unable to defend himself against the much
larger, younger man, the completely rattled educator finally stumbled
into the arms of a patrolman. At the station house, Ulrich's account at
first resulted in charges of attempted burglary against the bloodied,
tattered African-American. The situation was transformed in a flash,
however, when Washington, regaining control of himself, finally located
patent proof of his identity in his wallet. Ulrich was charged with
felonious assault and clapped in a cell pending payment of \$1,500
bail.[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-43){#cha-43}

In the days immediately afterward, a procession of worthies (the likes
of which had not assembled since the last Ogden Special) filed through
the lobby of the Hotel Manhattan to condole and console Booker
Washington. Seth Low, chairman of the Tuskegee Institute board of
trustees, headed the parade of distinguished sympathizers, which
included Carnegie, Schiff, Schieffelin, and Paul M. Warburg. Until news
of the grizzly Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire, which claimed the lives
of 146 women sweatshop workers, pushed the case onto the back pages,
newspapers enjoyed a field day with the Wizard's memorable night.
President Taft publicly proclaimed his confidence in Washington's
character; Carnegie stated that his trust remained rock solid; Peabody
refused to entertain a moment's doubt as to the veracity of his great
friend; Paul D. Cravath, New York's leading attorney, son of Fisk's
first president, Erastus Cravath, and chairman of the Fisk University
trustees, placed his formidable services at Washington's disposal;
ex-President Roosevelt privately sympathized but said nothing about
confidence; and Villard accepted his friend Low's account of the fracas
and ran it in the [Post]{.epub-i} without
comment.[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-44){#cha-44}

Washington's case against his assailant was strengthened after Anderson
and Wilford Smith, the Wizard's African-American attorney, exposed
Ul-rich as a bigamist whose New Jersey wife had sued him for desertion
and nonsupport, and revealed that the alleged Mrs. Ulrich was one Laura
Page Alvarez, mother of a young daughter and still married to Mr.
Alvarez. But when the white auditor of Tuskegee's books categorically
denied, as the Wizard had initially maintained, that he had ever
expected to meet his employer at 11Â½ West Sixty-third Street (the
address was unknown to him), and when Scott's letter to the Hotel
Manhattan directing Washington to the San Juan Hill address was said to
have been destroyed, many folk, black and white, were troubled and
puzzled. Despite their recent disputes, Villard was deeply concerned for
Washington's reputation, writing to Uncle Francis that the very
foundation of the Tuskegee edifice was imperilled. ""If he should not be
able to substantiate his story in court it would be a terrible thing,""
Villard trembled, ""and I have been sick at heart over it because there
are all sorts of storiesÂ ... that he really went to the place to meet a
white woman, etc.""[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-45){#cha-45}

The editor of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} had heard the same stories, and he
was positive they were true. Du Bois's exact New York address during
this period is unknown, but it must have been close by Marshall's Hotel
(where he frequently took meals), the famous African-American
establishment memorably recaptured by James Weldon Johnson in [Black
Manhattan.]{.epub-i} Marshall's, two large, overfurnished brownstones at
127--129 West Fifty-third Street, was the caravansary of bohemia, in
which aspiring and thriving actors and musicians, striving and
established writers and intellectuals, as well as handsome men and women
of dubious distinction and designs, commingled in interracial ease, many
of them well past dawn. Du Bois gleaned most of the facts about the
sensational Washington affair shortly after the story broke, and very
likely in Marshall's dining room. Washington had gone on at least one
previous occasion to the apartment building where he and Ulrich tangled,
guided there to sample one of the ladies of leisure by his bosom friend
and chief New York agent, Charles Anderson. The Wizards costly mistake,
Du Bois thought, had been to visit the address alone and probably not
entirely sober. ""Most great men have had an occasional moral lapse,"" he
confided to a fellow African-American scholar more than thirty-five
years later. ""The only surprising thing is that \[Booker T. Washington\]
had only one to come to the
surface.""[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-46){#cha-46} By then, Du
Bois's own private history of extramarital pursuits may have disposed
him to sympathize with his long-dead adversary.

Most of the Talented Tenth greeted news of the night of March 19 with
snickers and hoots among themselves. But, although the Wizard's
embarrassment was too delicious not to savor, even his most inveterate
enemies generally had better political and race-relations instincts than
to exploit his misfortune publicly. The humiliation of Washington could
have meant the crumbling of a valuable asset to his people---Tuskegee
Institute. And besides, the sooner the odor of illicit interracial sex
dissipated, the better for everybody. Du Bois confined [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} to culling the white and black press for coverage of
the assault. Trotter's [Guardian]{.epub-i} aimed at restraint, too,
although somewhat less convincingly, having told readers it had ""no
desire to take any advantage of his present troubles. We want to fight
men when standing up."" The white South also generally preferred to
strike a pose similar to Washington's African-American enemies, taking
its cue from the Richmond [Times-Dispatch.]{.epub-i} In the past, the
Wizard's supposed infractions of race-relations etiquette had occurred
in the course of professional business involving the family of the
president of the United States and that of the head of a
department-store chain. Considered to be morally innocent, he had been
fair game for noisy Jim Crow abuse. This time, however, the Great
Accommodator's moral innocence was uncertain to say the least. If they
now failed to give him the benefit of the doubt, then the South's white
leaders would be destroying their most useful creation. As another
Virginia newspaper, the Lynchburg [News,]{.epub-i} editorialized,
""Anything likely to seriously impair Booker Washington's usefulness as a
conservative influence among negroesÂ ... would furnish cause for genuine
and profound regret.""[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-47){#cha-47}

Yet if they were willing to spare the man and to finesse the issue of
character, Du Bois and his allies were determined to gain what advantage
they could for the NAACP. The third annual conference was to be held in
Boston that May. There was general nervousness about the momentum of the
new organization. Trotter and his circle were still smarting from real
and imaginary slights in connection with the centennial observance of
the birth of Charles Sumner in Boston that past January. In his usual
take-charge way, Du Bois had simply reserved Faneuil Hall for the Sumner
celebration without bothering to consult Trotter, who, as president of
the New England Suffrage League, had already laid elaborate plans.
Silken stroking of Trotter by Storey, Pillsbury, Francis Garrison, and
other Brahmins had saved the Sumner centennial from being the occasion
of bitter internecine competition; Du Bois and others agreed in the end
to come to Boston as guests of the New England Suffrage
League.[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-48){#cha-48} There was more
concern about money than Trotter in planning the third annual
conference, however---which really meant that Storey, Garrison,
Pillsbury, and Bumstead of the organizing committee were deeply
apprehensive about Washington's attitude. After Villard placed his
sympathy telephone call on March 19 to the recovering leader,
fund-raising for the annual conference turned out to be remarkably
successful. Villard had agreed with the Tuskegeean that
misunderstandings rather than objectives divided them, that the time for
a truce had arrived.[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-49){#cha-49}

Du Bois expected Washington to recover much of his prestige. He knew
that the Tuskegee Machine was badly damaged but far from broken. But he
interpreted the Tuskegeean's request for a truce as a sign of
desperation. With some reluctance, then, Du Bois went along with
Villard's proposal to invite Washington to issue a public endorsement of
the NAACP to be read at the conference. Even Trotter held his fire for
the moment. Meanwhile, shaken officers of the Bookerite realm urged
their sovereign to take Villard up on his offer. Moton argued for its
advantages; Anderson warned that it would be ""unwise"" not to accept; and
William Lewis, on his way to the first subcabinet post ever held by a
black American, cabled the working text to Tuskegee. On March 30, 1911,
Washington issued a statement of virtual concession in the form of a
telegram to Villard. ""The time has come,"" it stated, ""when all
interested in the welfare of the Negro people should lay aside personal
differences and personal bickerings, and keep in mind only rendering the
service which will best protect and promote the race in all its larger
interests.... I am sure that all of my friends everywhere will happily
cooperate with you in the directions that I have mentioned."" In return,
Washington expected the NAACP conference to vote to send two delegates
to the annual meeting of the National Negro Business League and to issue
an encouraging statement about his current troubles. In the driver's
seat now, the delegates at the Boston meeting finally voted a resolution
devoid of warmth and supportive of the injured leader only in the most
superficial sense: ""Resolved, that we put on record our profound regret
at the recent assault on Dr. Booker T. Washington in New York City, in
which the Association finds renewed evidence of race discrimination and
increased necessity for the awakening of the public
conscience.""[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-50){#cha-50} Du Bois,
Walling, Ovington, Morgan---all thought that was about as generous a
statement as the Wizard deserved.

But even the appearance of a truce was short-lived. President Storey,
treasurer Villard, and executive committee members like Butler Wilson
hoped for lowering of voices, whether or not actual cooperation between
the association and the Machine ever developed. This was no time for
African-Americans to be divided; ""they should present a solid front to
the enemy,"" Villard urged in a friendly letter to Moton. But it was
precisely because Du Bois had concluded that they had no such common
purpose---or should not---that his editorial in the June
[Crisis]{.epub-i} was intended to have the impact of a mortar
projectile. Harmonious cooperation with the Tuskegee Machine was the
last thing Du Bois could have wanted. Was it not even philosophically
impossible? he asked himself. Far more than personalities and specific
events were at play.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-51){#cha-51}
Insisting that the magazine would state ""openly the opinion of its
editor,"" then, Du Bois's June editorial, ""Starvation and Prejudice,""
gave the association's president and treasurer, among others, heartburn.
Not content simply to reject Washington's defense of his remarks in
England, Du Bois smashed the Great Accommodator to the core in his
conclusion:

Awful as race prejudice, lawlessness and ignorance are, we can fight
them if we frankly face them and dare name them and tell the truth; but
if we continually dodge and cloud the issue, and say the half truth
because the whole stings and shames; if we do this, we invite
catastrophe. Let us then in all charity but unflinching firmness set our
faces against all statesmanship that looks in such
directions.[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-52){#cha-52}

If he left his adversary's character unassailed, Du Bois clearly
intended to wound him as a leader, to do all that he could to prevent
both the man and the Machine from ever regaining their former power.
Much, much later, the editor confided to Charles H. Thompson of Howard
University's School of Education (the same acquaintance in whom he had
confided about the Ulrich scandal) that he attributed Washington's death
""to some extent to this
affair.""[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter15-53){#cha-53} The scandal
and the editorial marked a watershed in the civil rights advocacy of
African-Americans.

[NAACP]{.epub-sc}

[The Beginning]{.epub-bi}

""G[ENTLEMEN]{.epub-sc},"" A[TLANTA]{.epub-sc} University's famous
professor of economics and history wrote on July 5, 1910, ""having
accepted the position of Director of Publicity and Research in the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, I hereby
place in your hands my resignation."" Expressing regret immediately,
President Ware hoped that somehow Du Bois could continue directing the
annual studies and that Augustus Dill, Du Bois's selfless factotum,
might remain behind to make that possible. Twenty-seven days later, the
trustees accepted the resignation and voted official appreciation for
the ""great ability and devotion"" with which Du Bois had served the
university, noting with particular emphasis (and significantly in light
of the general impression he gave of aloofness) that the ""charm of his
personality and his prevailing good cheer have added much to the
enjoyment of life in the school family."" Dean Myron Adams, whose family
had shared the same floor with the Du Boises from earliest days, wrote
that his New York-bound colleague would be much
missed.[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-1){#cha-1} Du Bois was
leaving in such a hurry, however, that there seems to have been little
or no time for ceremonial farewells. Nina and Yolande were staying
behind, the trustees' executive committee having graciously complied
with his request that they be allowed to retain their South Hall
apartment during the coming academic year. Frankly owning up to the
vagaries of the NAACP offer, William English Walling, one of the new
associations organizers, had written Du Bois in early June, ""if I were
an old and intimate friend of yours, I should certainly urge you to take
the risk.""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-2){#cha-2} The risk was
just the sort of live option William James would have applauded, a
chance to create a new language and chart a new course for racial
assertiveness.

The organization Du Bois was leaving Atlanta to serve was still
undergoing birth trauma. Since its beginning the year before, as the
Conference on the Status of the Negro, the evolving NAACP had tacked
between two divergent conceptions of itself: the first, as primarily a
white organization dedicated to African-American uplift through
well-financed suasion; the second, as an interracial phalanx challenging
the mainstream public to accept ever-greater civil and social rights for
the nation's historic minority. Those who wanted Du Bois on board in a
commanding role favored the latter course, but Mary Ovington said that
most of their energies had gone into ""trying to keep the conservatives
from capturing us and get\[ting\] money from the radicals to do a
minimum of constructive work."" The widely held perception that what
became the NAACP was started by African-Americans is understandable but
only symbolically true. For that very reason, Du Bois deliberately
inflated the contributions of African-Americans when he chronicled the
events of the 1909 National Negro Conference. But Ovington and the
millionaire Socialist Walling, rather than Du Bois and Trotter, were the
sparks of the association; and Charles Edward Russell and Oswald Villard
were the engines.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-3){#cha-3} Kept
away from New York by classes and limited funds, Du Bois was able to
exercise no more than a secondary influence during the association's
first months. On the other hand, without Du Bois's imperial personality
and his books, articles, and lectures on race relations, the handful of
influential whites who broke ranks with the prevailing creed that
nothing could be done for black Americans would have been even smaller.
He and that handful of whites found themselves working together in a
single organization in 1910 primarily in response to the northern
version of the Atlanta riot.

The riot that devastated Springfield, Illinois, on the night of August
14, 1908, signaled that the race problem was no longer regional---a raw
and bloody drama played out behind a magnolia curtain---but national.
The alleged rape of the white wife of a street railwayman by a
well-spoken young black man was the immediate cause of the riot, but its
tremendous explosive power had to do with economics and demographics.
Springfield's population was only 10 percent African-American, but the
numbers were growing, and many of the new arrivals were hardworking and
even prosperous. A large percentage of the white newcomers came from the
upper South to work in the mines and rail transportation. When the
Springfield sheriff arranged to have George Richardson spirited out of
town to save his life, the angry crowd of street railwaymen that had
gathered around the jail was goaded into violence by a large, crude
woman crying out, ""What the hell are you fellas afraid of?... Women want
protection!"" Boardinghouse keeper Kate Howard's bawling challenge (the
press called her ""Joan of Arc of the mob"") led to more than eighty
injuries, six fatal shootings, two lynchings, more than \$200,000 in
damage, and the flight of some two thousand African-Americans before the
National Guard restored order. In the centennial year of his birth and
in the town where the Great Emancipator lay entombed, a white mob of
thousands swept like locusts through black neighborhoods, howling
""Lincoln freed you, we'll show you where you
belong!""[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-4){#cha-4} Nor had the
ordeal ended, for now that their lives were safe, Springfield's
African-American storekeepers found that their businesses were
endangered by the near-total boycott of the white inhabitants.

There was shock outside the South, and much smug comment within it. In
Illinois, however, there was equivocation as farmers and miners poured
into the town to join the mob, many of them heard shouting, ""Curse the
day that Lincoln freed the niggers!"" ""It was not the fact of the whites'
hatred toward the negroes,"" the [Illinois State Journal]{.epub-i}
suggested, ""but of the negroes' own misconduct, general inferiority or
unfitness for free institutions that were at fault."" The governor was
heard to wonder if an elderly black businessman had not invited his own
lynching by trying to defend
himself.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-5){#cha-5} Invidious
rationalizations such as these held fearful significance for the nation,
said the peripatetic Walling, who raced to the city with his Russian
wife, Anna Strunsky, just as the violence was subsiding. Two years
earlier, the handsome twenty-nine-year-old Walling had dashed to St.
Petersburg after news of ""Bloody Sunday,"" the massacre of peasants and
workers before the Winter Palace, reached him in Paris. His mother's
people had been Kentucky slaveholders, but the aristocratic Walling was
a passionate reformer who had left the University of Chicago to become
an Illinois factory inspector, a resident of New York's University
Settlement, a disciple of the magnetic social reformer Robert Hunter,
and a member of the American Socialist
party.[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-6){#cha-6}

""Race War in the North,"" Walling's article in the September 3 edition of
the [Independent,]{.epub-i} threw down the gauntlet to those who cared
about civil liberties and fair treatment. It was published less than
twenty-four hours after the adjournment of the fourth annual Niagara
Movement meeting in Oberlin, Ohio. If the Springfield riot had occurred
thirty years ago, the North would have been outraged, Walling wrote.
Instead, ""'mitigating circumstances'"" were offered up everywhere. The
real cause of the riot was ""race hatred,"" but ""we at once discovered
that Springfield had no shame,"" he lamented; but then neither did the
nation. The issue was clear, the moment historic: ""Either the spirit of
the abolitionists, of Lincoln and of Lovejoy, must be revived and we
must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and social
equality, or Vardaman and Tillman will soon have transferred the race
war to the North."" His final words about the widening persecution of
African-Americans had taken the form of an anguished question: ""Yet who
realizes the seriousness of the situation, and what large and powerful
body of citizens is ready to come to their
aid?""[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-7){#cha-7} Race relations now
constituted the American dilemma.

Mary Ovington had become obsessed with Walling's call to conscience. She
had decided instantly to commit herself to creating that large and
powerful body, writing Walling from her tenement in the San Juan Hill
section of Manhattan that he must count on her. Walling was already
counting on his close friend in the Liberal Club, Charles Russell, the
Socialist reformer, investigative journalist, and muckraker novelist, to
help him put together an organization of ""fairminded whites and
intelligent blacks."" One Saturday in May 1908 at New York's Republican
Club, Russell had listened to a judge, a minister, and a public official
discourse on the race problem, and then Du Bois spoke and ""eclipsed the
rest."" Twenty-five years later, Russell would remember that luncheon
speech in minute detail. ""In the logical and coherent arrangement of his
matter, in apt illustration, in research and knowledge, in the polished
and carefully chosen cameos of his language, in the faultless fluency of
his utterance---unequalled."" Henceforth Russell would be a Du Bois
stalwart. But it was Ovington who supplied the start-up spark after
meeting Walling at the close of his lecture on Russian politics at
Cooper Union. Negroes were treated even worse than Jews in Russia,
Walling had said, but as yet he had done little to put a stop to it.
Pressed by her in the weeks that followed, he finally called a meeting
in his New York apartment on West Thirty-ninth Street during the first
week in 1909. Ovington was there, along with social worker Dr. Henry
Moskowitz, but Russell was detained elsewhere. It was the seminal trio,
""a descendant of an old-time abolitionist, the second a Jew, and the
third a Southerner,"" Ovington
recalled.[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-8){#cha-8}

Once he got going, Walling was a powerhouse, bringing into the group the
cream of progressive reform---Ray Baker, Lillian Wald, Rabbi Stephen
Wise, Reverend John Haynes Holmes, Oswald Villard, and several others. A
manifesto or ""call"" was drafted, with Walling doing most of the writing;
something dramatic yet not too radical was needed. Both Ovington and
Holmes probably suggested Villard as the ideal final draftsman in light
of his social distinction and newspaper ownership. The publisher of the
[Evening Post]{.epub-i} and [The Nation]{.epub-i} ""received our
suggestion with enthusiasm,"" Ovington remembered, and set himself
immediately to the task.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-9){#cha-9}
The idea was to have a call approved, signed, and released to the public
on February 12, 1909, Lincoln's birthday. As the group grew too large
for Walling's apartment and began meeting at the Liberal Club on East
Nineteenth Street, it was Walling who drove it forward, enthusiastically
backing Ovington's recommendation that their ""Committee on the Status of
the Negro"" include two prominent African-American clergymen: Bishop
Alexander Walters, an organizer of the 1900 Pan-African Conference, and
Ovington's friend Reverend William Brooks. By the third or fourth
meeting sometime in March, Dr. William L. Bulkley, the only public
school principal of his race in New York City, had joined the core
membership group of fifteen, which by then also included Du Bois's
[Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} collaborator Isabel Eaton. It was at this
Liberal Club meeting that the decision was taken to launch a biracial
campaign to defend African-American rights and to hold a public
conference in the spring of that
year.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-10){#cha-10} Meanwhile,
release of Villard's call, with Du Bois's signature eleventh among
sixty-nine, had begun to generate considerable comment and even alarm in
some quarters.

Although Villard was an egocentric man of limited personal warmth, he,
like Du Bois, tended to express himself in writing with passion and
generosity. His appeal was no exception. Reeling off the mounting
outrages against the race of Africans in America, North as well as
South, he infused his prose with righteous wrath. The nation today would
dismay Lincoln. The Great Emancipator would find justice in some states
enforced, if enforced at all, by judges ""elected by one element in a
community to pass upon the liberties and lives of another"":

He would see the black men and women, for whose freedom a hundred
thousand of soldiers gave their lives, set apart in trains, in which
they pay first-class fares for third-class service, in railway stations
and in places of entertainment, while State after State declines to do
its elementary duty in preparing the negro through education for the
best exercise of
citizenship.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-11){#cha-11}

Silence in the face of such outrages meant tacit approval. ""This
government cannot exist half slave and half free any better today than
it could in 1861,"" warned Villard. The call summoned concerned men and
women, white and black, to New York's Charity Organization Society on
Monday morning, May 31, 1909, for the first meeting of what had now
become the National Negro Conference. Booker Washington's name was not
among the conferees. Although thoroughly disillusioned with the
architect of the Tuskegee program after hearing him bellow platitudes in
Carnegie Hall ""like a hoarse bullfrog"" and at the Lincoln dinner that
year, Villard extended an invitation that he was sure Washington would
decline. Washington did, replying with a slight hint of sarcasm,
perhaps, that his presence might ""tend to make the conference go in a
direction which it would not like to go."" His spies would be on the job,
though. The indispensable New York agent, Charles Anderson, had already
promised to do everything he could ""to discredit this
affair.""[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-12){#cha-12}

The high-ceilinged auditorium in the Charity Organization Society
building not far from Astor Place was filled on the morning of May 31,
its distinguished audience keenly aware of the history about to be made.
William Ward, editor of the [Independent,]{.epub-i} gave the ringing
keynote address. His newspaper, along with Villard's, had been one of
the rare white clarions of racial fair play. It was imperative to draw
battle lines, Ward told the capacity audience, time to proclaim to the
nation the ""absolute divergence of view between the ruling majority in
the SouthÂ ... and ourselves."" The three hundred or so men and women
listening to the newspaperman ranged from experienced social uplifters,
affluent dabblers in reform, descendants of abolitionists, public-minded
academics, and suffragettes, to a few labor organizers. Women comprised
almost a third of those attending, their perfumes and lotions combining
with the acrid body odors released as the warm day advanced. Although
overt discord between white women and black men had greatly abated since
the bitter days immediately after the Civil War, when Frederick Douglass
had colluded in sacrificing female suffrage for the half loaf of ballots
for black men, the tension still existed, below the
surface.[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-13){#cha-13} The presence
of Fanny Garrison Villard, Inez Milholland Boissevain, Isabel Eaton, and
other women backers of female suffrage was an encouraging augury. ""The
curiosity of the spectators was toward the darker and less known portion
of the audience,"" Du Bois noted. African-Americans were a distinct
numerical minority in the hall, dark faces here and there interrupting
the rows of white---yet their presence was all the more remarkable
because their numbers that morning were not negligible and some of their
best minds were represented, including Monroe Trotter and Mary Terrell,
Archibald GrimkÃ© and Ida Wells-Barnett, Kelly Miller, Bishop Walters,
and William Scarborough from
Wilberforce.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-14){#cha-14}

Ward's voice rose as he reaffirmed equal justice ""done to man as man,
and particularly to the Negro, without regard to race, color or previous
condition of servitude,"" a principle long since abrogated in the South
and now receding pell-mell in the North. Four learned white people
stepped to the podium: Columbia University anthropologist Livingston
Farrand; Cornell University neurologist Burt Wilder; Columbia political
economist Edwin Seligman; and, closing the charged morning session,
philosopher John Dewey, whose instrumentalist verdict on racism was that
it deprived society of ""social capital."" The rights denied to an entire
people because of color deeply troubled these progressive savants, but
the theme of the National Negro Conference in general and the morning's
speeches in particular concerned the basic humanity of black
people---their mental and biological parity with white people. Professor
Wilder, after presenting an array of charts, photographs, and
measurements relevant to the ""alleged prefrontal deficiency in the Negro
brain,"" thought it reassuring to tell the audience that ""many white
brains have lateral or ventral depression of the prefrontal lobe.""
Professor Seligman focused the proceedings on what he took to be
legitimate southern white social and political dilemmas. He hypothesized
that the African-Americans in the hall ""would feel about the whole
subject as they \[southerners\] do"" if they were to put themselves
objectively into the predicament of white
southerners.[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-15){#cha-15}

With heartening evidence of biological and mental equivalency in the
air, both races headed for lunch together at the Union Square Hotel
close by, so as to get to know each other. Interracial meals even in
large northern centers were rare and never risk-free. The previous year,
a well-attended dinner at Peck's Restaurant on Fulton Street, sponsored
by the progressive Cosmopolitan Club, was compromised by leering white
newsmen. The following morning the New York press, the [Times]{.epub-i}
included, had salaciously reported the conduct of Ovington and other
white women and black male guests in fancy
dress.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-16){#cha-16} To Ovington's
immense relief, lunch in Union Square went smoothly. When the conference
reassembled that afternoon in the vaulted auditorium of the Cooper Union
for the Advancement of Science and Art, Celia Woolley spoke. She was the
Unitarian minister who had pledged herself to black uplift, partly in
response to [The Souls of Black Folk.]{.epub-i} This redoubtable
suffragette and founder of Chicago's Frederick Douglass Center informed
the audience that the black man could better afford to lose his vote
""than the white man can afford to deprive him of it."" Du Bois's thoughts
as he sat on the dais reading facial expressions in the audience---Susan
Wharton from his [Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} period was there, along
with Sophonisba Breckinridge, Florence Kelley, Ray Baker, and many more
familiar allies in the struggle---can be guessed with fair accuracy. But
for the present, he would abide by the etiquette of black gratitude for
white solicitousness, writing animatedly in the June issue of
[Survey]{.epub-i} that the two-day conclave had found the Negro to be
fully human and the opposing argument to be ""utterly without scientific
basis.""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-17){#cha-17}

When it was his turn to speak, Du Bois served up a fair amount of
history and economics. His text that afternoon was entitled ""Politics
and Industry,"" and he began by taking the Cooper Union audience through
""three waves"" of black disfranchisement, starting with the first after
1700, in order to show the inevitable connection between cheap labor and
racial policy. He did not say so directly, but the impression was
unmistakable that he felt proof of Negro intelligence was a matter of
secondary importance. He did assert that, in their well-intentioned
concern with the deplorable housing, employment, health, and morals of
black people, white progressives mistook effects for causes. Black
people had lost their own self-respect and become almost a different
species in the eyes of many whites (of Farrand and Wilder?) not because
they were forced to live in squalid conditions but because they were no
longer citizens---civil persons---in the South, because they were
degraded by a ""new slavery"" that could never be abolished until they had
the ballot. His clipped tones filled the hall of almost fifteen hundred
listeners as he declaimed that the voteless Negro was a provocation, ""an
invitation to oppression"" serving always ""to distract attention from
real issues and to ride fools and rascals into political
power.""[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-18){#cha-18} Until the
African-American regained the ballot, his own economic advancement would
remain illusory and his value as an ally to white labor and mainstream
parties negligible. Economic power would come once political power had
been regained, not, as the Tuskegee creed maintained, through abstention
from politics and accumulation of wealth through patient, humble
industry.

When Walling spoke later that evening, he amplified Du Bois's analysis
with considerable brilliance, unmasking the antilabor and undemocratic
linkages being forged between southern and northern oligarchies. In much
of what was said in speeches as well as in freewheeling discussions, Du
Bois, Walling, and several others seemed on the verge of proposing an
alliance between African-Americans and organized labor. Du Bois's
tightly reasoned ""Economic Aspects of Race Prejudice,"" running at that
moment in the [Editorial Review,]{.epub-i} strongly implied such a
strategy. But both he and Walling knew, as did Ovington, that the black
and white working classes were decades away from being ready to
collaborate, that the mutual hostility of their leaders would prevent
any meaningful overtures. Active in the American Federation of Labor,
Walling had no illusions about the economic and racial conservatism of
the skilled-labor organization being built by the iron-willed immigrant
Samuel Gompers. Gompers would be inaccurately reported as saying in St.
Louis the following year that African-Americans should be expelled from
the labor movement, but his telegram to Du Bois in which he denied the
statement would merely show how plausible the mistaken report was, for
the Jewish labor president also said he doubted that blacks were capable
of understanding the labor
movement.[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-19){#cha-19} The linking
of the two movements, then, would remain for long a minor chord in the
official theme music of civil rights. Moreover, even to speculate about
such a linkage struck Villard and the other conservatives as dangerous.

The scientific evidence of human equality (the official theme of the
conference) and the ideal of interracial labor solidarity variously
moved the conference participants, but access to the ballot box for
black people, and collective action designed to bring that about,
emerged as the main business of the men and women at Cooper Union. The
black men and women who had bantered and deferred so nicely over lunches
at the Union Square Hotel seemed to the white participants suddenly to
have abandoned their concern for consensus on the second day. Du Bois
caught the mood that Tuesday in his [Survey]{.epub-i} account of the
conference. ""The scientific calm"" vanished, he wrote. ""The black mass
moved forward and stretched out their hands to take charge. It was their
problem. They must name the
condition.""[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-20){#cha-20} Was the
transformation of unskilled black labor into skilled workers of ""first
importance,"" as Reverdy Ransom amended; of ""great importance,"" as the
resolutions committee proposed; or, of ""vital importance"" as Bishop
Walters successfully amended? How could there be ""too much racial
agitation""? Trotter and Wells-Barnett demanded to know, after a white
participant had seemed to say as much. Wells-Barnett spoke passionately,
without any hint of diplomacy, for those who favored the boldest
declarations. She must have been the woman Du Bois described as leaping
to her feet when someone proposed inviting Booker Washington to serve on
a prospective committee, and crying ""in passionate, almost tearful
earnestness---an earnestness born of bitter experience---'They are
betraying us again---these white friends of
ours.'""[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-21){#cha-21} President Taft
should be censured without qualification, Trotter claimed, in view of
his announced intention to appoint to federal office only those
African-Americans whom the South regarded as trustworthy. Speaking on
behalf of his National Independent Political League of Boston, and
joined by Max Barber and others---but especially by J. Milton Waldron,
founder of the National Negro American Political League of the District
of Columbia---Trotter doggedly raised objections and proposed amendments
until the proceedings were gaveled to their
close.[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-22){#cha-22}

Earlier in the evening, Walling had fumbled badly as chairperson of the
resolutions committee, and Villard had stepped into the breach to pound
out the final resolutions that were to be voted on by the full
conference. Villard's resolutions were received like live bait tossed to
piranhas, mangled, chewed, and regurgitated, until the call for the
question decided their fates. The National Committee for the Advancement
of the Negro came into being on June 1 after interminable wrangling over
semantics and points of order lasting until midnight. The
African-American participants were little men ""always with a nasty
spirit,"" bent on talking ""incessantly,"" Villard would complain to his
uncle, Francis Garrison; their conduct was so atrocious, in fact, that
the owner of the [Evening Post]{.epub-i} found Du Bois's behavior by
contrast ""most useful."" Wells-Barnett was incensed by the turn the
proceedings took in the last exhausted minutes before midnight.
Presiding officer Russell recognized Du Bois as chair of the committee
to nominate the interim governing body---the Committee of Forty. Du Bois
read the names quickly, and in the whorl of ensuing motions, Russell
declared the nominating committee's recommendations approved and gaveled
the National Negro Conference to a close. In a philosophical mood
afterward, Villard decided that ""these poor people who have been tricked
so often by white men"" ought not to be blamed for being so fractious,
yet the experience had been ""none the less trying."" The unflappable
Russell ""saved us from being blown up,"" Ovington wrote afterward. Trying
times were far from over, though. Du Bois sounded positively euphoric in
[Survey,]{.epub-i} but he knew better; he was writing for both public
consumption and for the benefit of institutional solidarity.

So the conference adjourned. Its net result was the vision of future
cooperation, not simply as in the past, between giver and beggar---the
older ideal of charity---but a new alliance between experienced social
workers and reformers in touch on the one hand with scientific
philanthropy and on the other with the great struggling mass of laborers
of all kinds, whose condition and needs know no color
line.[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-23){#cha-23}

The thousand or so men and women streaming out of Cooper Union into the
night of June 21 had voted a reprimand of the president of the United
States, demanded strict enforcement of civil rights under the Fourteenth
and Fifteenth Amendments, appealed for African-American access to the
ballot on the same terms as other citizens under the Fifteenth Amendment
(female suffrage was not addressed), and called for equal educational
opportunities for all Americans in all the
states.[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-24){#cha-24} But agreement
on these significant matters was temporarily diminished by the commotion
over organizational structure. It was the resolution calling for a
Committee of Forty on permanent organization---the resolution Villard
had drafted with particular care---that set off explosions. Ida
Wells-Barnett was not on the list for the Committee of Forty, nor were
Monroe Trotter and Milton Waldron. They walked out into Cooper Square in
the early dawn stunned and angry. In her fury, Wells-Barnett broadcast
the charge that Du Bois and Ovington were responsible for her omission
from the Committee of Forty, a charge still circulating today. Ovington,
Wells-Barnett claimed, was jealous of her accomplishments and Du Bois
resented her frank independence.

In a vivid autobiographical account, Wells-Barnett claimed that,
surrounded by a knot of dismayed white people in the near empty hall, Du
Bois, race radical, confirmed feminist, and sole African-American member
of the nominating committee for the Forty, lamely apologized for
crossing out her name. He had thought, said she, that her place should
go to Chicagoan Woolley. According to Wells-Barnett, Du Bois also told
her that by deleting her name, he had been able to place the loyal
Niagarite male, Dr. Charles E. Bentley, another Chicagoan, among the
Forty. Du Bois and several others supposedly now pleaded with
Wells-Barnett for permission to reinstate her. ""Of course, I did a
foolish thing,"" she wrote of her refusal and rustling departure, eyes
glistening. ""My anger at having been treated in such a fashion
outweighed my
judgment....""[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-25){#cha-25}

Although he did present the final list of names for the Forty that
evening, Du Bois's role on the committee was decidedly subordinate to
that of Villard, who had, as Walling wrote ruefully to Du Bois (who had
immediately returned to Atlanta), arbitrarily added and deleted names
during the week following the conference. Moreover, as Ovington
remembered that night, whatever her feelings about Wells-Barnett, she
repeatedly applauded Charles Russell's ""quite illegal"" decision to add
Wells-Barnett to the Committee of Forty after the tiny crusader had
cornered him, bursting with indignation as the conference adjourned.
Insofar as Du Bois was concerned, failure to include Wells-Barnett on
the original list of Forty was probably motivated far less by personal
animus than by well-intentioned (though possibly sexist and perhaps
mistaken) calculations as to the most positive public effect of the
final, ""balanced"" roster---calculations influenced by chairperson
Villard's dogmatic opinions. On the other hand, Wells-Barnett was a
woman of unrestrained outspokenness who seldom acknowledged the gender
etiquette of her day when fighting for a cause. She may have presumed a
good deal on Du Bois's large ego. In any event, the affront to
Wells-Barnett was exceedingly costly because it figured in her decision,
after some hesitation, to withdraw from the work of the
NAACP.[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-26){#cha-26}

Villard, the real force behind the Committee of Forty, was accustomed to
moving in the world as one whose anointed course was manifest and
impervious to correction. His was the imperiousness of an
eleven-year-old who in 1883 had traveled to Montana country with
deferring dignitaries from Washington and Europe to watch Henry Villard,
his father and president of the German-financed Northern Pacific, hammer
home a golden spike linking the northern route across the continent. The
son heard as well the high calling of Garrisonian reform from his
maternal forbears. It was said by many who endured his peremptory
competence that Oswald's legacy was ""compounded of New England
abolitionism, the German Revolution of 1848, and Northern Pacific
Railroad shares."" Since 1902, he had helped raise \$150,000 for the
Tuskegee endowment fund. He was founder and current chairman of the
Men's League for Women's Suffrage. Uncle Francis, youngest son of the
great William Garrison, told him he was the ""natural successor to the
custodianship"" of the family's abolitionist tradition. If the idea for a
national Negro committee originated with Walling and Ovington, Villard
presumed that its success depended on him---""the people who have it in
charge are well-meaning but they are inexperienced and impractical,"" he
wrote Uncle Francis.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-27){#cha-27}

The Committee of Forty would determine the ideological mold of the new
civil rights organization, choose its board of directors, and hire its
staff; and Villard made it clear that he intended to be the ringmaster
of the Forty. He was certain that no civil rights organization could be
credible if led by radicals, which meant excluding African-Americans
like Trotter and Wells-Barnett from leadership positions and minimizing
the damage that could be done by Du Bois. Although Booker Washington had
been rightly excluded from their proceedings, Villard spoke for his
mother, Fanny Villard, Uncle Francis, family friend and former
Massachusetts attorney general Albert E. Pillsbury, Edwin Seligman, and
others on the National Negro Committee when he insisted that the
preeminent race leader must not be publicly disavowed. Villard had
promised the Wizard: ""It is not to be a Washington movement, or a Du
Bois movement."" In order not to shut the door on accommodation with
those friendly to Tuskegee, Trotter, Waldron, and Wells-Barnett, all
bitter detractors of the Wizard, were excluded from the Committee of
Forty. But the donnybrook at Cooper Union had shown Villard that ""the
whole colored crowd was bitterly
anti-Washington.""[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-28){#cha-28}
Little wonder that Wells-Barnett declared later that Washington had
seemed to sit astride them during the Cooper Union proceedings.

Du Bois returned to Atlanta knowing that he was going to have to make
the most important decision of his professional life. Many of the men
and women at the Cooper Union meeting expected him to play a major role
in marshaling a new civil rights coalition. As much as Villard and other
well-meaning white friends of civil rights wanted to spare Booker
Washington's reputation and to continue paying lip service to his
program of compromise, Du Bois understood with cool clarity that the
success of this new organization necessitated the deflation of the Great
Accommodator's national standing and ultimately the destruction of his
machine. Manners, modesty, and good politics precluded any such averral
by the parties, but observant spectators appreciated the degree to which
American race relations had now become personified. Down in Tuskegee
where he thought he had become, ""for all intents and purposes, a Negro,""
sociologist Robert Park put such thoughts on paper. ""These two men have
divided the white and dark world between them,"" he wrote. ""Du Bois has
defined the situation as one of radical and irreconcilable opposition.
Washington is cooperative despite divergences and differences, not,
however, minimizing the conflict of interest where it exists."" Du Bois
would have agreed with Park about irreconcilable opposition.

This two-day conference marked the end of the era of accommodation, the
twilight of Baldwin, Ogden, and Washington, Du Bois wrote. ""The answer
long forced on the American world has been: Let them alone; do not
agitate; do not let loose dangerous forces and passions,"" he thundered
in [Survey.]{.epub-i} Now the passions were loose. The problem of the
twentieth century was about to be attacked, vigorously and collectively.
And on his shoulders and those of the Talented Tenth, which he had
largely nurtured, the race's destiny would fall. It was, he wrote long
after the experiment had run its course, ""the opportunity to enter the
lists in a desperate fight aimed straight at the real difficulty: the
question as to how far educated Negro opinion in the United States was
going to have the right and opportunity to guide the Negro
group.""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-29){#cha-29}

Du Bois began to hear of machinations intended to confine the policy
decisions to a coterie of distinguished white men. Service with the
national committee was to be voluntary and unsalaried. All personnel
decisions were the exclusive province of the committee chairman, Oswald
Villard, and, as Walling complained to Du Bois, Villard soon showed
himself unreceptive to having more than a few African-Americans on the
Committee of Forty. Even worse, Walling confided further that Villard
had committed a ""stupendous error"" (according to Milholland) in removing
six or seven African-American names after three or four new ones had
been added. Having already successfully proposed enlarging the Committee
of Forty to fifty, Walling was determined to force a showdown over this
issue. (Villard and his uncle dismissed the idea as preposterous; they
would have preferred a Committee of Twelve.) Du Bois, Wells-Barnett,
Bentley, Mary Terrell, Hershaw, Richard R. Wright, Bishop Walters,
Scarborough, and the educator Leslie Pinckney Hill of Virginia were
already in place. Walling and Ovington steadily pushed the numbers of
African-Americans higher, adding Waldron, GrimkÃ©, the Philadelphia
physician William A. Sinclair, and Reverend William Brooks of New York
to the Forty (but Kelly Miller never made the
cut).[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-30){#cha-30}

Villard's great wealth and influence, as well as his devotion to the
cause, were lost on none of the organizers, but, for Walling, Ovington,
and Milholland, Du Bois was indispensable both as an organizer and a
symbol, a view shared by Brooks, Bulkley, GrimkÃ©, Hershaw, Sinclair, and
most of the other African-Americans on the Committee of Forty. But
Villard's influence in the National Negro Committee continued to grow,
especially after he became acting chairman of the Committee of Forty
after Walling, claiming ill health (in reality, a bruising breach of
promise suit was in the offing), lay down the chairmanship at the end of
the first meeting on November 8, 1909, a gathering at the Liberal Club
that Atlanta-bound Du Bois was unable to
attend.[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-31){#cha-31} There has
never been a suggestion that Villard's unsigned review in [The
Nation]{.epub-i} of Du Bois's [John Brown,]{.epub-i} which ran ten days
before the meeting at the Liberal Club, was directly connected to policy
clashes within the National Negro Committee. A man of Villard's
patrician self-righteousness quite likely never paused to consider the
impact that his trashing of a rival's biography might have upon the
incipient NAACP. All along, he had found fellow Harvard man Du Bois
astonishingly lacking in deference and too inclined to extreme views in
the area of social equality (Villard's Georgia-born wife insisted that
her husband invite neither black people nor Jews to their home). Both
took pains to write well in order to acquire wide influence, and both
presumed that their large ideas mirrored the destinies of many lesser
folk. ""There was much I liked in Villard himself,"" Du Bois said, but
this railroad tycoon's son ""naturally expected \[African-Americans\] to
be humble and thankful or certainly not assertive and
aggressive.""[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-32){#cha-32} Villard,
on the other hand, believed that Du Bois's famed intellect and even his
character were not quite authentic when measured against the highest
white standards which he, Villard, embodied---as the grossly deficient
[John Brown]{.epub-i} proved. Du Bois was enraged by the harsh review at
the worst possible moment, and the resulting fracas between the two
impaired the work of the committee.

By the first months of 1910, the impressive momentum of the 1909
National Negro Conference was almost entirely lost. Increasingly
distracted by medical and personal concerns, Walling had flagged, while
Pillsbury, as well as many Committee of Forty members like Milholland,
Wald, or Wise, were compelled to divide their energies among several
professional and reform activities. But the committees real
problems---for example, its miserable success in raising even part of
the ten thousand dollars Villard thought minimally necessary---had less
to do with book reviews or individual demands than with
Tuskegee.[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-33){#cha-33} Too astute
to oppose this new National Committee for the Advancement of the Negro
openly, and probably not yet sure of the threat it posed, the Wizard
pulled levers from offstage, instructing his New York people---Fred R.
Moore and Thomas Fortune at the [Age]{.epub-i} and Charles Anderson---to
redouble their surveillance efforts. White House chats and numerous
letters also urged ""true friends of President Taft notÂ ... to be
deceived concerning the present state of mind of the colored people of
the country,"" as Washington reminded Judge James Cobb, one of his
influential satellites in the federal capital. Dismayed and pained by
white collusion in black mischief, George F. Peabody and Robert Ogden
frostily withheld their blessings. Except for the predictable [Evening
Post, Nation,]{.epub-i} and [Independent,]{.epub-i} mainstream coverage
of the conference was negligible. The New York [Sun]{.epub-i} sent a
reporter, but published instead an interview with the
Wizard.[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-34){#cha-34}

Faced with tantrums from Walling and the group's general churlishness
(which his own conduct had done much to provoke), Villard exhorted,
jollied, and once or twice threatened to resign until the stalwarts on
the Committee of Forty managed grudgingly to pull together. At the
Liberal Club on February 14, and in special session a few days later,
Villard pressed his colleagues into action. A firm mid-May date was set
for the second annual conference, and Villard introduced Frances
Blascoer, an attractive no-nonsense white woman with experience in
settlement-house work, whose position as salaried executive secretary to
the National Committee for the Advancement of the Negro was ratified.
Again, Du Bois was absent, in
Atlanta.[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-35){#cha-35} Next came the
composition of a Preliminary Committee on Permanent Organization,
chaired by Villard. Du Bois, Milholland, and Seligman (all of whom were
absent) along with Walling and Russell were voted members. The first
meeting of this crucial committee was fixed for Wednesday, March 30. One
of Blascoer's first duties was to record the reaction to a detailed plan
for the organization's permanent form submitted by the still-absent Du
Bois. ""Prof. Du Bois sent a fine scheme for organization,"" she wrote an
unidentified correspondent, and Villard, who read the proposal to the
group, agreed with Ovington and the majority that it should guide the
deliberations of the new preliminary committee. Blascoer found Villard,
whose mother paid Blascoer's salary, to be ""a pretty fine fellow, even
if he hasn't Walling's damnably acute
intelligence.""[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-36){#cha-36}

The February meetings had pretty much decided the name of the
organization as the National Committee for the Advancement of the Negro
(Villard was adamant about ""advancement"" figuring in the title), plans
for incorporation were discussed, and the problematic motion by
Milholland that the committee merge with his Constitution League had
been dodged by referring it to the Preliminary Committee on Permanent
Organization. There was unmistakable progress. In Boston, Du Bois had
delivered a public address in late March and sent a letter to the
[Transcript]{.epub-i} impugning the Wizards fatal monopoly of power,
""for the last eight years.... the sole referee for all political action
concerning 10,000,000 Americans."" Only those African-Americans who
agreed with the Wizard's policy of ""giving up of agitation and
acquiescence in semi-serfdom"" have been advanced by the Tuskegee
Machine, Du Bois
thundered.[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-37){#cha-37} In his
Boston address and then in the May [Horizon,]{.epub-i} Du Bois was at
his most merciless in his denunciation of the Tuskegee forces, pressing
the attack in terms of economic exploitation and working-class
solidarity. The Niagara Movement was the future. ""The vested interests
who so largely support Mr. Washington's programÂ ... are to a large
extent, men who wish to raise in the South a body of black laboring men
who can be used as clubs to keep white laborers from demanding too
much.""

At this critical juncture Villard threw down the gauntlet to Washington
and tendered an olive branch to Du Bois, writing the editorial in the
April 1 edition of the [Evening Post,]{.epub-i} ""Mr. Washington in
Politics."" Du Bois noted the strategic compliment Villard paid him of
virtually paraphrasing [in extenso]{.epub-i} the Boston
[Transcript]{.epub-i} letter, as well as ""Of Mr. Booker T. Washington
and Others,"" Du Bois's devastating essay in [The Souls of Black
Folk.]{.epub-i} Villard told [Evening Post]{.epub-i} readers that there
was a cleavage now beyond repair in Afro-America, a breach the nation
must now make the effort to understand. ""Eternal vigilance is the price
of liberty for the negro as for the white man,"" he proclaimed, ""and Du
Bois is merely living up to the highest traditions of American life when
he fights for the rights of his own people to a voice in their
government."" Booker Washington, on the other hand, had a perfect right
to subordinate ""everything else to the uplifting of the negro
industrially and economicallyÂ ... and so he reaches the ears and softens
the hearts of thousands who would not listen to a word from Dr. Du
Bois.""[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-38){#cha-38}

A few weeks later, Lillian Wald secured a small donation from Jacob
Schiff, a major defection from Bookerite financiers. Money had begun to
flow in, and Horace Bumstead, Susan Wharton, Clarence Darrow, Franz
Boas, Albert Hart, Mary Terrell, Reverdy Ransom, and a growing cast of
boosters publicized the goals of the committee and its forthcoming
conference set for May 12. Secretary Blascoer, who had written her
friend at the end of March that dealing with Walling, Wells-Barnett, and
especially with the very Russian Mrs. Walling had plunged her into a
""blue funk"" and caused her to tear her hair, now breathed easier.
Wells-Barnett had ""finally calmed down, and has practically accepted an
invitation to come on again, and speak---we pay her
expenses.""[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-39){#cha-39} In choosing
Blascoer, Villard had put the national committee in the competent hands
of someone wholly in accord with his businesslike approach who could be
expected to defer to him. He recognized that Du Bois's pen and his
Niagara loyalists were invaluable. But it was certainly not his wish to
install Du Bois---in his eyes an icily proud and uncontrollable
extremist---in New York with a salaried title and an organizational
mandate to make war on the hosts of bigotry. Attendance at Executive
Committee meetings, the forwarding of reports and memoranda, publication
of articles on behalf of the Association and its causes would be service
enough. For Du Bois, the new organization was the chance of a lifetime.
""When in the past overtures have been made to me to leave the work in
Atlanta and go at a higher salary, to Hampton, to Tuskegee, to Public
Schools in Washington and elsewhere,"" Du Bois told [Horizon]{.epub-i}
readers, invariably, he had decided his ""duty lay in Atlanta."" But here
was a ""pioneer organization, an experiment, but an attempt to do bravely
and courageously a work that must be
done.""[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-40){#cha-40}

Assessing his situation, Du Bois had good reason to appreciate the high
price of courage. Across the country, African-American men and women of
modest means and major ambitions were being compelled to look into
themselves, weighing principles against careers, in order to make
fateful decisions about whether to risk falling in with his small band
of underfinanced, politically insignificant college-bred adventurers or
to pledge allegiance to the mighty Tuskegee empire. Du Bois himself
expressed surprise at the degree to which the controversy with Booker
Washington had become ""more personal and bitter than \[he\] had ever
dreamed and which necessarily dragged in the University."" Although
nothing was said explicitly, Du Bois knew that the president and
trustees were suffering extreme discomfort in the Wizard's tightening
vise. And if he reasonably blamed his opposition for the polarizing of
loyalties in Afro-America, Du Bois's own conduct was as much a factor in
causing neutrality to be censured as rank evasion and pragmatism to be
arraigned as virtual treason. His warm friendship with Hope nearly
foundered on the shoals of the controversy earlier that year when Hope
revealed that, ""through the kindness of Mr. Booker Washington,"" he had
secured a conditional offer of ten thousand dollars from Andrew
Carnegie. One early January evening at Towns's home, Du Bois and a small
group of Niagarite men had roasted the Atlanta Baptist College president
about being a turncoat, what Hope himself described as ""not a scorching,
just a comfortable warm brown."" Yet, later mulling over what had been
said (especially by Du Bois), Hope was prompted to write his good friend
a nineteen-page letter from Providence, Rhode Island. It was a
remarkable document, a mixture of contrition and self-exoneration.
Although sometimes misunderstood by the public, the college president
said that never before had he defended himself, preferring to let his
actions speak for him. But Du Bois ""was the one man to whom I thought I
might owe an explanation.""

The power of Du Bois to exact loyalty based on principle and of the
Wizard to compel choices based on reality was seldom more vividly
illustrated: why did he owe Du Bois an explanation? Hope continued.
""Because I have followed him; believed in him; tried even, where he was
not understood, to interpret him and show that he is right; because I
have been loyal to him and his propaganda---not blatantly so, but, I
think, really loyal; and because, in spite of appearances, I am just as
truly as ever a disciple of the teachings of Du Bois regarding Negro
freedom.""[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-41){#cha-41} Hope pleaded
for understanding, imploring, ""no matter whether you doubt the wisdom of
or resent my action, are we friends?"" Yet Hope also made it clear that
his decisions must be governed by a college ""that needed the assistance
and ought to be helped rather than hampered by its president."" He should
not have to feel himself caught between ""a [tyranny]{.epub-i} of views,""
after all. How well Hope understood Du Bois is shown by the close of his
apology: ""The opposing views of other men do not so much concern you in
your thinking because you have hardly needed them in your equation. That
is genius. I am a plodder."" Friendship yes, but not full absolution, Du
Bois admonished Hope. ""One thing alone you must not, however, forget.
Washington stands for Negro submission and
slavery.""[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-42){#cha-42} The Devil
would surely take his pound of flesh. Hope put in writing thoughts that
Atlanta's Ware had entertained. For a good many years to come, the fate
of African-American higher education would require the patience and
conciliation of plodders. Geniuses need not apply.

As the reformers, academics, settlement workers, Niagarites,
Constitution Leaguers, suffragettes, and the rest filed into the Charity
Organization Society building once again on the afternoon of May 12,
1910, the status of African-Americans in politics and public service,
already grim, was becoming ever more dismal. Whereas Theodore Roosevelt
had made a show of a handful of black federal appointments, William
Howard Taft slowed the trickle to a few drops, insisting that he could
not alienate the white South, as his predecessor had done, by
uncongenial black appointments. With their power to influence federal
patronage sputtering badly, the doctors, lawyers, preachers, teachers,
and undertakers aboard the Tuskegee Machine now began to check their
road maps. Judge Robert Terrell, whose independent-minded wife served on
the Committee of Forty, would shortly warn the Wizard of widespread
disaffection among their forces. Whether in Ohio or Michigan, Terrell
found ""all of them and their friends bitter in their expressions and
their attitude against the national administration."" Robert Russa Moton
(""Major"" Moton, the head of cadets at Hampton), who would succeed the
Wizard as principal of Tuskegee, issued the same
warning.[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-43){#cha-43} And while the
professional classes were being battered, the people Booker Washington
had pledged to empower in his famous Atlanta address---the black
peasantry of the South---had become mudsill.

Charisma, as Max Weber would famously postulate, imparted momentum to
institutions, which then created the basis for effective bureaucracy.
For Walling, Ovington, Russell, Milholland, and the critical mass of
African-Americans in the National Committee, charisma meant W. E.
Burghardt Du Bois. Until they offered a place and a wage to ""a colored
leader of nationwide prominence, Dr. Du Bois,"" Walling argued, they
could do little to further the cause of civil and social
rights.[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-44){#cha-44} Race politics,
the horrific plight of black tenant farmers, the lynching of ninety-two
African-Americans a year, and the partisans of Du Bois within the
organization finally caused Villard to change course when the second
annual conference opened. The theme of the conference had after all been
largely set by Du Bois. The first conference had focused on the humanity
of African-Americans; this one concentrated on ""Disenfranchisement and
Its Effects upon the Negro."" Finally meeting face to face again, Villard
and Du Bois shook hands publicly (they ""shook hands across the chasm,""
Ovington said) and collaborated in clockwork concert during three days
of high-pressure sessions on May 12, 13, and
14.[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-45){#cha-45} But enmity as
crystalline as their egos would govern their dealings with each other
over the decades to come.

On Saturday evening the second National Negro Conference adopted the
report of the Preliminary Committee on Organization. This was a tribute
to Du Bois's carefully drawn plans sent up earlier from Atlanta, plans
bearing the unmistakable imprint of the lordly, competent Villard as
well. What was to become the nation's oldest civil rights organization
now officially sprang into being as the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the great hall of the Charity
Organization Society. ""Colored"" was chosen instead of Afro-American or
Negro in order to proclaim the association's intention to promote the
interests of dark-skinned people everywhere, Du Bois said, and his
wishes in the matter were probably
decisive.[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-46){#cha-46} Contrary to
general belief later, neither the Constitution League nor the Niagara
Movement was formally affiliated with the new association, the issue of
the former's relationship having been held over for future action in
order not to foreclose conciliation with
Tuskegee.[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-47){#cha-47} Although
altered somewhat when the 1911 constitution was approved, the basic
shape of the NAACP emerged from the 1910 conference.

A national Committee of One Hundred was created; as well as a
thirty-person executive committee, with its members to be elected from
the national committee. Fifteen members of the executive committee were
to reside in New York, and fifteen elsewhere. Membership called for
payment of two-dollar annual dues, with life memberships purchasable for
five hundred dollars, two hundred dollars for donors. As president of
the NAACP, the members chose Moorfield Storey, a cornerstone of the
Boston establishment, past president of the American Bar Association
and, as a young lawyer, personal secretary to the venerable abolitionist
Senator Charles Sumner. Judicious, principled, possessing enormous, if
waning, influence in national circles of power, the white-maned Brahmin
was the perfect choice to head an organization for which no black
person, however distinguished, could be considered in 1910. Storey, who
had not been able to attend the conference, was notified after the fact.
The new officers of the association were Walling as chairperson,
Milholland as treasurer, and Villard as assistant or ""disbursing""
treasurer.[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-48){#cha-48}

But there was still no place for Du Bois until the executive committee
convened on Saturday morning, May 14, presided over by Russell. Titles
were debated and approved, salaried positions created, and duties
(Blascoer's in particular) redefined. Emphasis shifted from Villard's
membership rallies and fund-raising to investigation and propaganda, the
sort of work Walling and Ovington knew Du Bois would accomplish with
distinction. The situation was still fluid, nevertheless. ""With some
hesitation I was asked to join the organization,"" Du Bois recalled. ""The
secretary then in charge was alarmed about her own job and suspicious of
my designs."" The incorrigibly frank Blascoer announced that she was not
going to work for an organization that subordinated her duties to
research and publication activities. She made her views known to
Villard's mother; and, after the executive committee meeting on May 25,
when the position of salaried ""director of publicity and research"" was
finally voted, she let Du Bois have a piece of her mind. The NAACP
should first be put on a sound financial footing before plunging into
the ""immense amount of work"" involved in publicity, she wrote him. Du
Bois intimated that he thought that part of Blascoer's problem was an
aversion to working with a black man. ""In some most incomprehensible
manner,"" she snapped back, he had twisted her objections into ""a refusal
on my part to work with youÂ ... because of your
color.""[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-49){#cha-49} Blascoer left
the NAACP shortly thereafter to work with black schoolchildren in New
York and wrote an important book about the experience. She was unlikely
to have been prejudiced in the way Du Bois thought, but the
[malentendu]{.epub-i} prefigured Du Bois's relations with the
association's whites.

Meantime, while Blascoer stewed, Du Bois's \$2,500 salary as the
prospective director of publicity and research was nowhere in sight. As
late as June 20, treasurer Milholland would ""regret to say that things
are not moving along the line"" as fast as he had hoped. Income from the
sales of printed conference speeches, a few large donations like those
of Mrs. W. H. Forbes of Massachusetts and Jacob Schiff (most gratified
by the second annual conference resolution condemning the czar's
expulsion of Kievan Jews), and pledges from members of the Committee of
One Hundred had put only a few hundred dollars in the treasury.
Milholland proposed an alternative to Du Bois: office space in the
Philadelphia branch of his Constitution League if Villard continued to
drag his feet. Finally, in his upbeat letter of June 8, formally
offering Du Bois the position, Walling was certain that when the
""wealthy people of New York and Boston"" returned from summer vacations
in Europe, Du Bois's salary would be secure. ""I have no doubt you
realize, that we are offering you work and an opportunity,"" Walling
hardly needed to point out, ""rather than a financially promising, or
steady position.""[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-50){#cha-50} Du
Bois replied that he would run ""any reasonable risk"" to commit himself
to work of ""paramount and critical importance."" And besides, with the
Tuskegee Machine roaring at the university's gates, his usefulness in
Atlanta was greatly compromised.

The impertinent criticism by Du Bois and Milholland of the Tuskegeean's
public statements during his trip to England that fall had deeply
rankled Tuskegee. Washington had confidentially blamed what he called
the gang of ""absolute failures"" surrounding his rival. The Wizard was
certain that rich, busy white folk up North would never have thought
such things had it not been for that writing machine Du Bois and his
Niagara Movement. ""I think it is too bad,"" Washington bristled in a
letter to the Atlanta [Constitution']{.epub-i}s Clark Howell at the end
of November, ""that an institution like Atlanta University has permitted
Dr. Du Bois to go on from year to year stirring up racial strife in the
heart of the South."" The next time Schiff or some other wealthy
northerner asked the Tuskegee principal's advice about disbursal of
monies to southern schools, the odds against a significant grant to
Atlanta University were sure to grow even
longer.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-51){#cha-51} Fortunately
for Atlanta University, Du Bois had departed for New York four months
before the Wizard's angry letter to Howell. He was lucky to have a job
to go to, and the association, as Ovington said, was finally really in
business. ""These days were the climacteric of my pilgrimage,"" Du Bois
noted of his leave taking, with more fustian than usual. ""Stepping,
therefore, in 1910 out of my ivory tower of statistics and
investigation, I sought with bare hands to lift the earth and put it in
the path in which I ought to
go.""[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter14-52){#cha-52}

C[LASHING]{.epub-sc} T[EMPERAMENTS]{.epub-sc}

D[U BOIS'S GENIUS]{.epub-sc} was obvious to Booker Washington. But
Booker T. Washington had not walked out of slavery and a West Virginia
coal mine thirty-six years and multiple personalities ago to find
welcome in Theodore Roosevelt's White House and the foyers of the rich
by mistaking merit for reality. Mistakes about people and policies could
destroy everything he had built up. In a less fraught world, one
configured to wider tolerances, Washington would have been more disposed
to tolerate disagreement with himself; but his was the era of [Plessy v.
Ferguson,]{.epub-i} of the doctrine of separate but equal racial
status---a doctrine enshrined by the highest court of the land one
significant year after his own famous ""separate as the five fingers""
speech at the 1895 Atlanta and Cotton States Exposition. His public
life, therefore, had been dictated by savvy calculation, accomplished
deception, and perfect opacity---qualities either in short supply or
wholly absent from Du Bois. Grappling for the key to his complex
personality, Washington's masterful biographer, Louis Harlan, likened
him to an onion whose peeled layers only exposed yet another layer until
there were no more. Close associates called him the ""Great Accommodator""
and the ""Wizard of
Tuskegee.""[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-1){#cha-1}

Whether or not he truly believed the bromides he dispensed far and wide
and with indefatigable good humor, Washington never doubted their
necessity. A leisurely perusal of [Black-Belt Diamonds,]{.epub-i} the
popular 1898 edition of his speeches, yielded such gems as that lynching
""really indicates progress. There can be no progress without friction"";
that slavery gave the African-American ""the habit of work""; or that, if
the oppressed African-American ""can be a medium of \[southern whites'\]
rising into the atmosphere of generous brotherhood and
self-forgetfulness, he will see in it a recompense for all that he has
suffered."" Washington's ""darky"" jokes were famous. At Harvard to receive
an honorary master's, he let on as how he felt like a huckleberry in a
bowl of milk. Negroes and mules had so much in common, he liked to say,
that you were bound to find as many of one as the other in every Alabama
Black Belt county. He would bring down the house with the anecdote about
an old handy man who, when told to clean out the henhouse that was to
serve as Tuskegee's first classroom, queried with astonishment, ""'What
you mean, boss? You sholy ain't gwine clean out de hen-house in de
[day]{.epub-i}-time?'""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-2){#cha-2}

Sometimes Booker Washington could go too far, seeming to demean his
people in bread-and-butter situations that were no laughing matter to at
least some genteel white Christians. Miss Martha Calhoun of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, wrote him to say how appalled she had been by a December
1900 speech in which he had ludicrously depicted African-Americans
bumbling themselves out of service-industry monopolies. She saw nothing
in the story ""to make an audience laugh.... It is not really because of
improved methods that the white man has wrested this honorable and
lucrative occupation \[barbering\] from his colored brother. It is
because he is the [stronger]{.epub-i} popular one, and in the majority.""
Washington knew this, but was serenely unruffled by such reproaches. As
for the few mavericks among his own people who ventured to chastise him,
he felt a puzzled contempt. Called ""an apologist and a trimmer"" by the
influential Washington [Bee]{.epub-i} in late 1899, he scratched his
head and made a note to himself to buy the African-American newspaper.
What was left, he would have asked them, now that the white South was
ascendant, but the politics of compromise and the mien of ingratiation?
It was and would remain an article of faith with him that the future
prosperity of his race lay in the South ""where the Negro is given a
man's chance in the commercial world."" What he had had to say at the
1898 anniversary of the founding of Hampton picturesquely summed up his
philosophy:

If today, we have fewer political conventions, we have more economic
gatherings. If we have fewer political clubs, we have more building and
loan associations. If we cherish fewer air-castles, we own more acres of
land and more homes than has ever been true in the history of the Negro
race. If we have fewer men in Congress, we have more merchants and more
leaders in commerce.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-3){#cha-3}

The founding in 1901 of the National Negro Business League under his
presidency was meant to be the centerpiece of Washington's
progress-through-prosperity agenda. The idea was Du Bois's, as was the
wealth of data on which the organization was built, but the start-up
energy, publicity, and resources came from Tuskegee. The unmistakable
major premise of Washington's business gambit, in fact, was that through
financial successes and by making themselves indispensable to the
South's economic growth, eventually African-Americans would earn their
way into full citizenship---regaining all and more of the rights and
privileges they had provisionally surrendered. ""The black man who spends
ten thousand a year in freight charges can select his own seat in a
railroad train,"" one of his ""Black-Belt diamond"" homilies gleamed, ""else
a Pullman palace car will be put on for
him.""[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-4){#cha-4} Washington believed
this utterly. But he believed with equal fervency in the northern
Midases supporting his bargain, for without the luster of their
names---Carnegie, Eastman, Peabody, Baldwin, Rockefeller, Rogers,
Schiff, Villard---and the manna from their cornucopia philanthropies,
his leverage with southern white politicians and public officials would
have been even less than it was. It is even possible that Booker
Washington was their idea. Du Bois in [Dusk of Dawn,]{.epub-i} years
later, would scrutinize their motives with merciless accuracy. ""This
Northern group had clear objectives,"" he wrote:

They were capitalists and employers and yet in most cases sons,
relatives, or friends of the abolitionists.... These younger men
believed that the Negro problem could not remain a matter of
philanthropy. These Negroes were not to be encouraged as voters in the
new democracy, nor were they to be left at the mercy of the reactionary
South. They were good laborers and they might be better.... Properly
guided they would restrain the unbridled demands of white labor, born of
the Northern labor unions and now spreading to the
South.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-5){#cha-5}

For Booker Washington, the man who first personified these interests was
the railroad magnate William H. Baldwin, Jr. If, as some have believed,
Samuel Armstrong took the place of the father he never knew, then the
intense Baldwin, with his steel-blue eyes and high forehead, was the
kind overseer Booker had been too young to know in slavery. Former
vice-president of the Southern Railroad Company, president of the Long
Island Rail Road, workaholic Tuskegee trustee, Boston-bred Baldwin was
seven years younger than Washington, yet he played from the beginning
the role of grand vizier of Tuskegee. He had at first declined an
invitation to sit on the board of trustees until a surprise visit
afforded an inspection of the campus from chapel to kitchen. He had been
so wrought up in the quarter hour before Washington delivered his
Atlanta Compromise speech that he remained outside the pavilion pacing
and waiting for the results. Chairing the board's executive committee,
Baldwin took charge of the school's finances. So that Gilded Age
grandees arriving by personal Pullman car might be minimally incommoded,
Baldwin extended the tracks from the nearby whistle-stop at Chehaw to
the campus. Nervous, impatient, intolerant of contrary opinions, and
decisively convinced of African-American inferiority, Baldwin saw the
solution to the South's race problem in salvation through work and
rights after obedience. There had been too much pious nonsense about
equality spouted by misguided Yankee idealists, his own ancestors
included, he told the 1898 meeting of the American Social Science
Association at Saratoga. ""How false that theory was thirty long years of
experience have proved.... Social recognition of the negro by the white
is a simple impossibility, and entirely dismissed from the minds of the
white, and by the intelligent
negroes.""[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-6){#cha-6}

Baldwin and his kind were determined to bring industrial progress and
social harmony to the South. The profit motive drove them every bit as
much as it did their European analogues scrambling across the African
continent, many genuinely propelled by the tenets of a hardheaded
Christianity that called for making amends for sins while turning a
dollar. As Baldwin saw it, two forces posed the greatest threat to his
enlightened work---the South's unreconstructed racists and the
African-American intelligentsia. The latter especially made him furious,
and he regularly communicated his contempt for such people to his friend
at Tuskegee. Baldwin, himself a Harvard man, had a specific group in
mind, the Negroes ""who have been highly educated at Harvard College,"" he
wrote in early February 1900, the same month in which Du Bois and
Washington were discussing the Tuskegee and District of Columbia
positions. Their problem was ""purely an attempt on their part to be
white people."" The mere thought of Atlanta University's intellectual and
social pretentions galled him. His views were shared by other Tuskegee
trustees, especially by Philadelphia's Robert C. Ogden. Baldwin, Ogden,
Frissell, and their kind would have regarded Du Bois's landing the D.C.
position as the worst possible symbolism---a brainy, brown elitist
heading what the government clerk Richard Thompson called ""the greatest
school system in the world controlled by colored
people.""[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-7){#cha-7} Baldwin may have
arrived at the conclusion before Washington did that installing Du Bois
at Tuskegee was the best way to neutralize him. No doubt they made
themselves heard soon after the Wizard checked into the Grand Union
Hotel.

Washington's motives in dealing with the Atlanta professor as he did may
have been more complex. On the one hand, powerfully connected
individuals like Hart were not to be ignored, and the status of Tuskegee
as a racial laboratory would certainly be enhanced by Du Bois's
presence. On the other, Du Bois's conduct up to that point (especially
after his performance during the Afro-American Council meeting) may have
led Washington to think that Du Bois really could (as Du Bois had
suggested when asking for a reference) ""serve both \[his\] cause and the
general cause of the Negro."" In any case, it took the Wizard no time at
all to get out of his quandary. On March 12, a day after Du Bois was
told not to make use of the letter of endorsement for the assistant
superintendency, commissioner John Ross wrote Washington, somewhat
cryptically, that he would ""take pleasureÂ ... in bringing your views to
the attention of my associate
Commissioners.""[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-8){#cha-8} Whatever
those views were (probably to select the assistant superintendent from
the local candidates), they were not favorable to Du Bois's going to the
District. That Du Bois was unhappy at Atlanta should have meant that he
would be all the more ready to accept Tuskegee. To Washington's mind, he
had merely assured the sociology professor of one estimable job by
withholding his blessings from another, leaving all the
parties---Baldwin, the Terrells, Pledger, and Du Bois himself---well
disposed. The Atlanta professor's domestic situation---Burghardt's
tragic death and Nina's trauma and pregnancy---would hardly have weighed
in Washington's calculations, even if he had been aware of it. For Du
Bois, however, the loss of the public school post was both
professionally and personally wounding. The fact that he wanted it would
have been, in his mind, sufficient reason for his elevation to it. Who
could have been more qualified? When the District's board of education
finally selected its new assistant superintendent, the pleasant,
hesitant Winfield Montgomery, Du Bois would have decided that no more
blatant proof of politics over merit was needed.

Condemned to more years of valorous research and teaching in his Masada
above West Mitchell Street, he had been sharply confronted with what was
in store for him and his family in the South just after returning from
his first visit to Tuskegee that February. The experience had not been
good for his peace of mind. United States' plans for participation in
the Paris Exposition of 1900, which was to welcome in the new century,
called for a ""Negro Section"" under the direction of Fisk classmate
Thomas J. Calloway, now an employee of the War Department and one of Du
Bois's allies in the capital. Calloway had asked Du Bois to take charge
of assembling exhibits primarily from Georgia but also from several
other southern states. Boarding the train in Atlanta on the night of
February 19 to attend the meeting of exposition commissioners in
Savannah, Du Bois was flatly refused an overnight berth aboard the
Cincinnati-Jacksonville express after arguing with the Pullman
conductor, the train conductor, the flagman, and even the hapless car
porter. Compelled to ""sit up all night"" in the crowded, filthy ""colored""
car hooked just behind the engine, he filed formal protest with the
Southern Railway Company---""has the Railway given orders to its
conductors to refuse Negroes sleeping car accommodations?""---sending a
copy of the letter to Booker
Washington.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-9){#cha-9} The issue of
Jim Crow public facilities infuriated Du Bois; many decades later he
wrote about it in the language not of cool social science but of flesh
and blood victimization. Passionately re-creating such an experience, he
would ask readers of [The Autobiography,]{.epub-i} ""Did you ever see a
'jim-crow' waiting room?"" Leading them from an unheated waiting room
with a ticket sold by a snarling white agent after a long delay, Du Bois
boards the dilapidated car ""caked with dirt, the floorÂ ... gummy and the
windows dirty"" for a ride into segregation incomparably described:

\[An impertinent white newsboy\] yells and swaggers and a continued
stream of white men saunters back and forth from the smoker to buy and
listen. The white train crew from the baggage cars uses the ""jim-crow""
to lounge in and perform their toilet. The conductor appropriates two
seats for himself and his papers and yells gruffly for your tickets
before the train has scarcely started.... It is difficult to get lunch
or drinking water. Lunch rooms either ""don't serve niggers"" or serve
them at some dirty and ill-attended hole in the wall.... If you have to
change cars be wary of junctions which are usually without accommodation
and filled with quarrelsome whites who hate a ""darky dressed up."" You
are apt to have the company of a sheriff and a couple of meek or sullen
black prisoners on part of your way and a couple of dirty colored
section hands will pour in toward night and drive you to the smallest
corner. ""No,"" said a little lady in the corner (she looked like an ivory
cameo and her dress flowed on her like a caress), ""We don't travel
much.""[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-10){#cha-10}

What made racial discrimination so hard to bear for Du Bois was not only
(or not even?) the enforced segregation but the utter, arrogant absence
of all discrimination along class lines, as this vivid passage with its
cringing cameo woman of breeding and beauty implied.

An angry Du Bois was ready and willing to enter into [cause
cÃ©lÃ¨bre]{.epub-i} litigation. The battle to ride public transportation
unsegregated had begun seventeen years before in Tennessee when one of
Du Bois's most remarkable contemporaries had been hauled by a pack of
bullying white men from a train with the conductor's flesh between her
teeth. A tiny spitfire of a woman whose life was an uninterrupted civil
rights crusade South and North, Ida B. Wells-Barnett dragged the
Chesapeake & Ohio all the way to the state supreme court before losing
in 1887 on the grounds that her ""persistence was not in good faith.""
Nine years later, when the United States Supreme Court sided in effect
with the state of Tennessee in [Plessy v. Ferguson,]{.epub-i}
African-Americans lost the battle for unsegregated public transportation
and other facilities [within]{.epub-i} the borders of a state. The
interstate battle loomed ahead, and as Du Bois discussed his
professional future with Washington, he also invited the principal's
help, telling him that a high official of the Southern Railway in
Atlanta conceded that separate but equal regulations ""did not apply to
interstate travel.""[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-11){#cha-11}
The Wizard's first reaction to a public and legal counterattack was
encouraging.

He couldn't have known that five days after writing to Tuskegee about
the Southern Railway matter, its former vice-president diplomatically
yet firmly advised Washington how to proceed. On March 19 Baldwin
informed his friend of a talk with some of the railroad presidents about
segregated Pullman cars. ""They feel that if the colored people should
raise an issue it would cause nothing but bitterness."" He assured
Washington that ""in such cases as that of Mr. Du Bois, or a possible
interference with you,"" doing nothing ""would help as much as anything to
bring about a liberal interpretation of the Law."" As in his responses to
numerous other major and minor injustices along the color line, the tack
taken by the Tuskegee principal in Du Bois's railroad-discrimination
encounter ended, after much letter-writing, telephoning, and
procrastination due to rumors of impending announcements of policy
compromises by the railroads, ambiguously. Despite his forthright pledge
of influence and financial assistance, the Wizard's backing of Du Bois
would end four years later when Washington was imperiously rebuffed by
the attorney for the Pullman Company. Du Bois was informed that the last
best avenue had been tried. Washington saw no point then in financing a
court battle and so it would be agreed not to bring suit against the
offending railroad.[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-12){#cha-12}

The irresolution involving Jim Crow transportation lay ahead, but for a
decisive temperament like Du Bois, the mandarin style of Booker
Washington would have grated from the beginning. He would almost surely
have entertained doubts about the Tuskegeean's good faith even as he
went ahead with the agreement to organize a legal defense committee.
Already smarting from the turn of events in the District of Columbia, Du
Bois finally made up his mind about Tuskegee. Having given the matter
long and earnest thought, he informed Washington on April 10, 1900, that
he had ""decided not to accept your very generous offer."" His horizons
were somewhat larger than the scope of Tuskegee, he felt. The only
opening that would attract him ""would be oneÂ ... \[that lay\] nearer to
the centres of culture and learning and thus gave me larger literary
activity."" Everything---instinct, personality, location, and
politics---militated against his going to Tuskegee. It would never be an
opportunity to further the enlightened interests of the race. Service at
Tuskegee meant service to Booker Washington. Du Bois, however, had no
intention yet of alienating the Wizard. There was too much riding on
that powerful man's indulgence, if not his goodwill. Despite another
disturbing example of bad faith a month after turning down the Tuskegee
offer, Du Bois conducted himself with restraint verging on generosity.
The loyalty he had displayed during the Afro-American Council fracas had
been rewarded with the directorship of the council's Negro Business
Bureau and the promise of a small budget to defray organizational and
research expenses. After the work was completed and the request for
reimbursement presented, however, Washington's man Fortune successfully
moved that the executive committee annul the appropriation. Shortly
thereafter, Washington asked Du Bois for his data categorizing and
analyzing minority business activity, together with the all-important
mailing list. Du Bois wrote back in mid-May that he would comply ""in a
week or two,"" and Booker T. Washington's National Negro Business League
was born.[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-13){#cha-13}

Superficially, their relations remained cooperative and cordial. Du Bois
would attend the annual two-day Tuskegee Conference in February 1901,
writing a glowing summary of its achievements for [Harper's
Weekly;]{.epub-i} several more visits as Washington's guest were to
follow. In March, an article on ""The Negro in Business,"" ghostwritten
for the Wizard in [Gunton's Magazine,]{.epub-i} generously noted Du
Bois's [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} and the Atlanta University
Studies. Du Bois even accepted an invitation to go on a well-publicized
West Virginia fishing and camping trip with Washington, Fortune, two of
the ""wealthiest colored men in this country"" (according to the newspaper
[Colored American]{.epub-i}), and several other notables of the race in
late September of that year, canceling only at the last minute.
Ironically, the management of the C.C.&S. railroad placed a private car
at their disposal, even as Washington tried in vain to arrange a
promised meeting about Du Bois's Southern Railway discrimination case
with Robert Todd Lincoln, attorney for the Pullman Company and son of
the assassinated
president.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-14){#cha-14}

All the while, Du Bois would keep a sharp eye on the D.C. assistant
superintendency. He disguised his hurt at having been shabbily shunted
aside, greatly underplaying it in his memoirs. In fact, he would pursue
the position over the next six years. Maintaining a disengaged public
stance, he covertly encouraged his Washington allies, who created
considerable trouble for the vulnerable Montgomery. Attorney James Adlai
Cobb, another astute, black Tuskegee agent in the capital and a future
municipal court judge, reported regularly to the Wizard's secretary
Emmett Scott about the endless board of education cabals, with Mrs.
Terrell always in the thick of them (Mr. Terrell became a municipal
court judge with Washington's blessing in 1901) and Du Bois waiting in
the wings. In mid-August 1906, during intense scrimmaging for the
colored superintendency (it had just been upgraded), the Du Bois forces
would almost score a touchdown, ""but it was too late,"" Cobb reported,
""as Mrs. Terrell had done the work."" The beleaguered Montgomery was
given a year's reprieve. ""The Du Bois turn-down is rather interesting,""
an amused Cobb would add at the end of the month. ""He seems determined
to land in Washington if he can possibly do
it.""[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-15){#cha-15} The following
year, however, Booker Washington's candidate, Harvard man Roscoe
Conkling Bruce, able but imperious son of Mississippi's second
African-American U. S. senator, would ascend from Tuskegee Institute to
the District superintendency, killing Du Bois's hopes once and for all.
By then, of course, civil estrangement between Du Bois and Washington
would have led to civil war within the race.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

B[UT IN]{.epub-sc} the summer of 1900 civility still prevailed, and in
any case Du Bois was busy enough with other concerns. The fifth Atlanta
University Studies conference behind him, he left Nina five months
pregnant for New York City and Europe, sailing steerage in mid-June with
several boxes of exhibits for the Paris Exposition Universelle. He was
thirty-two now, still very much a Europhile, but a good deal more
critical of the so-called White Man's Burden as he detected unmistakable
signs of a fraying civilization. Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II's
annihilation of a crack Italian army at Adwa in 1896 (the first
significant military defeat in modern history of Europeans by Africans)
he took to be a portent of prodigious significance. A military tribunal
sitting throughout the month of August 1899 at Rennes had just found
Captain Alfred Dreyfus guilty of treason a second time, although the
identity of the real traitor and the conspiracy of the army general
staff against the Jewish officer had been fully exposed. Implacably
divided into Dreyfusards and anti-Dreyfusards, wallowing in anticlerical
and anti-Semitic orgies, the French were said to be a disgrace to the
white races. ""Missionary work could be profitably performed in France as
well as in the unexplored regions of Central Africa,"" Montana's attorney
general declared. William James, deeply saddened by the behavior of the
French, gave thanks that he ""lived in a
Republic.""[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-16){#cha-16}

The letters written to Nina during his two months abroad have not
survived, making it difficult to track his movements. Much later, his
prose caught the spirit of a civilization serenely sunning itself at
high noon. He was excited by this European punctuation in time whose
immodest motto proclaimed the Exposition Universelle [""le bilan du
siÃ¨cle""]{.epub-i}---the summation of the century. The splendid new Pont
Alexandre III linked the exposition's 280 acres stretching along both
banks of the Seine from the Eiffel Tower to the Place de la Concorde.
Spectacular palaces erected to Arts and Letters, Agriculture, Civil
Engineering, Education, Electricity, Housing, Hygiene, Mechanics, and
Metallurgy competed with the arrogant national pavilions of Germany and
Great Britain, and the vastly popular Russian one (containing a gigantic
marble and jasper map of France with its cities marked by precious
stones). France offered the flamboyantly baroque Grand Palais and its
sister Petit Palais. ""It was one of the finest, perhaps the very finest,
of world expositions,"" Du Bois decided, ""and it typified what the
European world wanted to think of itself and its
future.""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-17){#cha-17}

The building on the rue des Nations that housed the American Negro
Exhibit, assembled by Thomas Calloway and Du Bois, was a plain white
structure devoted to the ""science of society."" Because Du Bois had
arrived well after the April opening of the exposition, some of the most
interesting materials in the exhibit---books, models, patents, and so
forth---had yet to be uncrated when the judges passed. However, what
they saw among the five hundred photographs, captions, maps, and plans
drawn from Atlanta University, Berea, Fisk, Howard, Hampton, and
Tuskegee impressed them enough to award Du Bois, ""Collaborator as
Compiler of Georgia Negro Exhibit,"" a gold medal. If the world wanted to
know what a disadvantaged people could do for itself, Du Bois proudly
reported in [American Monthly Review of Reviews,]{.epub-i} there was ""no
more encouraging answer than that given by the American Negroes, who are
here shown to be studying, examining, and thinking of their own progress
and prospects.""[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-18){#cha-18}

The Pan-African Congress meeting in London during the last week in July
was another curious sign of disadvantaged peoples beginning to stir.
Pan-Africanism came with the Zeitgeist, an inevitable, derivative idea,
at once circumspect and revolutionary. It was another movement exploding
into the twentieth century like a stick of dynamite---Pan-Hellenism,
Pan-Germanism, Pan-Slavism---with the Irish, Afrikaners, Armenians,
Serbians, and other historic ""races"" already lighting fuses for the new
century. Its ""civilizationist"" forefathers---Africanus Horton, the
Sierra Leonean philosopher; J. E. Casely-Hayford, the Gold Coast
newspaper publisher; Blyden and Crummell, the Liberia expatriates;
Delany and Turner, the sojourners---were Afro-Saxon gentlemen who
acknowledged the tutelage of Africa by Europe as indispensable for many
decades to run. None of them deplored the Scramble for Africa that the
1884 Berlin Conference had done so much to accelerate. None doubted that
the gory sub-Saharan conquests of a King Leopold, a Cecil Rhodes, or a
Henry Stanley were redeemed by noble ends---that, as Blyden wrote,
European conquest ""was ultimately for the good of that
continent.""[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-19){#cha-19} But their
inherently revolutionary Pan-African idea was bound to take on a life of
its own. The term itself, coined by Henry Sylvester Williams in a
November 1899 letter to a London associate, was less than a year old
when Du Bois first encountered it. Williams, a Trinidadian barrister
trained in Canada, was thirty-one years old and recently established in
London. One of the most visionary colored men of his generation, he was
cultured, dedicated, and globe-wandering, but he would be practically
forgotten when he died aged forty-two.

When Booker Washington met him during his 1899 summer visit to England,
Williams was the moving force behind the two-year-old African
Association, an organization of West Indian professionals whose
constitution committed them to ""encourage a feeling of unity and to
facilitate friendly intercourse among Africans in general; to promote
and protect the interests of all subjects claiming African descent,
wholly or in part, in British colonies and other places."" Tuskegee was
preparing to send three of its graduates to Togoland early the following
year to assist the German colonial administration and a quasi-private
cartel in cotton cultivation and the setting up of vocational training
centers for African boys. It was part of the Wizard's plan to have
Tuskegee play a limited but well-publicized role in the continent's
technical development as far north as Morocco and east to the Sudan.
Williams's African Association intrigued the Wizard enough to make him
attend one of its meetings and even to agree to sponsor a proposed
Pan-African Congress in London the next year. He declined to be present
himself. Washington felt about as much need for solidarity with Africans
as did the explorer Stanley (who once explained to a like-minded Wizard
that African-American emigration to Africa was impracticable), but
Washington was sure that the more black people in America learned about
European treatment of Africans, the more tolerable the conditions in the
South would seem to them. It therefore pleased him to issue a public
letter on July 15, 1899, begging and advising ""as many of our people as
can possibly do so,"" to attend the 1900 Pan-African
Congress.[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-20){#cha-20} The success
of Williams's novel effort in July 1900 was in no small degree due to
the influence of Booker Washington.

The three days of meetings on July 23, 24, and 25 in Westminster Town
Hall were historic. Joined by members of the Aborigines Protection
Society, the Society of Friends, other observers, and spectators,
thirty-three men and women representing people of African descent from
throughout the world took their seats to be welcomed by the bishop of
London. Among the six delegates from the United States were two women
from Washington, D.C., Anna J. Cooper and Ada Harris. Cooper was an
Oberlin graduate and only months away from succeeding Robert Terrell as
principal of the famous M Street High School. She arrived anxious to
read her conference paper, ""The Negro in America,"" which flailed her
country for its Christian
shortcomings.[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-21){#cha-21} The
honor of presiding over the congress had been bestowed upon another
American, Bishop Alexander Walters of the AME Zion denomination,
sometime president of the Afro-American Council and another figure whose
independence and intelligence made the Wizard uneasy. Walters was a
flexible conservative, a defender of Protestantism and profit who stood
squarely for African-American voting rights. As late as 1910, the bishop
was calling for his people to ""furnish the Negro Cecil Rhodes to
Liberia, the man who is to developÂ ... a line of steamships between that
country and ours.""[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-22){#cha-22}
Calloway, who had crossed the channel with Du Bois, found himself
elected treasurer of the U. S. branch of the new Pan-African
Organization. Du Bois was in the company of racial equals for a change:
Benito Sylvain of Haiti, a Pan-African reincarnation of Talleyrand and
former aide-de-camp to the Ethiopian emperor; Samuel Coleridge-Taylor of
London, a musical prodigy; John Alcindor of Trinidad and London, an
Edinburgh-trained physician and chief collaborator in Williams's African
Association; and Henry ""Box"" Brown, aged hero of the Underground
Railroad, which had shipped him in a box out of slavery to freedom in
Canada.[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-23){#cha-23}

The pitch in which the Westminster Town Hall proceedings was to be
played had been pretty well fixed by Williams a few days earlier at
Gough's Hotel in Dublin where the barrister chastised Great Britain for
failing to uphold African rights, particularly in South Africa. The
message to the world was a moderate, trusting appeal for an imperialism
that lived up to its highest pieties. These were refined men and women
who might have caused a character in a Kipling story to regret that they
were not white---or not white enough. After the ""magnificent repast""
offered by the bishop of London at Fulham Palace on the second day,
Alexander Walters's memoirs fairly burst with pride as Du Bois, Sylvain,
Calloway, a certain Miss Jones, ""and others moved about the palace
grounds with an ease and elegance that was surprising; one would have
thought they were 'to the manor born.'"" In [The Times's]{.epub-i}
coverage and during the delightful ""at home"" hosted by the Reform Club
for the delegates, the unspoken satisfaction in observing such
well-behaved, dark-skinned effigies of the White Man's Burden was
implicit in the
condescension.[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-24){#cha-24} Yet if
there was nothing palpable in the Westminster papers and speeches for
the Colonial Office to fret over, the congress itself was an
unmistakable harbinger of distant restiveness.

Twenty-five years later, after Du Bois had come to personify the
Pan-African movement, it was mistakenly assumed by scholars that he had
dominated the 1900 deliberations, which is an exaggeration. Du Bois
himself seems to have forgotten completely about Williams, not once
mentioning his name in print until forty-seven years
later.[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-25){#cha-25} A strange
memory lapse; but perhaps he was so caught up in the forces Williams had
set in motion that he soon convinced himself that he was as much the
source of them as he was their premier interpreter and conductor. The
ideological reality (as opposed to the historical truth) of the first
Pan-African Congress was that Williams's lasting achievement came with
the defining moment of ""To the Nations of the World,"" Du Bois's speech
delivered before the Westminster Town Hall audience in the closing
session. ""In the metropolis of the modern world, in this closing year of
the nineteenth century"" (the grave cadence and crisp diction prefigured
momentous phrasings that would reappear slightly changed in [The Souls
of Black Folk]{.epub-i}), ""there has been assembled a congress of men
and women of African blood, to deliberate solemnly upon the present
situation and outlook of the darker races of mankind."" As he spoke now,
the commercial sentiments of Booker Washington and Bishop Walters were
absent:

The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the colour line,
the question as to how far differences of raceÂ ... are going to be made,
hereafter, the basis of denying to over half the world the right of
sharing to their utmost ability the opportunities and privileges of
modern civilization. To be sure, the darker races are today the least
advanced in culture according to European standards. This has not,
however, always been the case in the past, and certainly the world's
history, both ancient and modern, has given many instances of no
despicable ability and capacity among the blackest races of men. In any
case, the modern world must needs remember that in this ageÂ ... the
millions of black men in Africa, America, and the Islands of the Sea,
not to speak of the brown and yellow myriads elsewhere, are bound to
have great influence upon the world in the future, by reason of sheer
numbers and physical contact.... If, by reason of carelessness,
prejudice, greed and injustice, the black world is to be exploited and
ravished and degraded, the results must be deplorable, if not fatal, not
simply to them, but to the high ideals of justice, freedom, and culture
which a thousand years of Christian civilization have held before
Europe.[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-26){#cha-26}

For a few pregnant moments, rhetoric and platitudes yielded to prophecy.
Yet, however edifying and prescient, the statement was not intended to
signal some radical change in their thinking about Queen Victoria's
legitimate overlordship. Du Bois's passage in ""To the Nations of the
World"" in which he called ""as soon as practicable \[for\] the rights of
responsible self-government to the black colonies of Africa and the West
Indies,"" was bold but not unprecedented and was not to be interpreted as
a demand for independence from the British Empire. The independence of
African peoples from European suzerainty seemed in 1900 a prospect
incalculably far in the future, even to a clairvoyant Du Bois. Moreover,
any clarion call for the demise of the British Empire would have been
impolitic and severely reprimanded by the London hosts of these genteel
Pan-Africanists.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-27){#cha-27}

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

H[EADING HOME]{.epub-sc} as the last months of the nineteenth century
ran down, Du Bois had the satisfaction of having fostered a new movement
and fathered a second child. A very pregnant Nina was finishing her term
in Great Barrington in the care of Uncle James and other Burghardts.
Nina Yolande arrived sometime during Sunday, October 21, a large, lively
baby girl, cafe-au-lait in color. Her parents were delighted; the new
baby brought them closer together than they had been since Burghardt's
death. The deep, concealed psychological wounds---his as well as
hers---had a fair chance of beginning to heal. Looking back, it does
seem that a certain amount of that healing occurred. The uncomplicated,
affectionate letters that Nina wrote Will a bit later about diapers and
toys and tantrums have the feel of reconnection about them but also of
loneliness. She seemed to be coping with her research and
lecture-circuit widowhood. What some women friends did begin to notice
about her, though, was a heightened passion for cleanliness, her
insistence on repeatedly scrubbing every item that Yolande wore or might
come in contact with---especially the soles of the baby's shoes. Nina
had always been meticulous, good as a German Frau, Will liked to say;
but the care of Yolande was compulsive---a prophylactic regimen to
assure to Yolande what in their inexperience she and Will had failed to
give Burghardt. The neurotic basis of her behavior escaped Du Bois. He
saw her repetitive conduct grow and shrugged it off as a mildly peculiar
habit with little or no significance outside the affairs of the home.
Individual behavior in any case was never to be his specialty; he
excelled in analyzing the human condition, rather than human
conditions.[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-28){#cha-28}

Friendships began to develop. Faculty families came around to admire
Yolande. Invitations to teas and dinners were exchanged, although Nina
begged off more often than Will would have liked, relying more and more
heavily on Lizzie Pingree and one or two other women of somewhat
flattened profiles in the community. The Bowens, Herndons, and Proctors
cultivated them. They were closest to the Towns and Hope families.
George Towns and John Hope were Du Bois's closest male friends in
Atlanta. Towns had gone away to Harvard College for a second bachelor's
after finishing Atlanta University in 1894, then returned there to
become professor of pedagogy and English. His birthplace was the south
Georgia town of Albany, but he had been transformed by his Atlanta and
Harvard education into a classic Yankee type, erect, spare of words,
self-reliant, honest, and punctilious. Towns was small and wore glasses.
In appearance he was more suited to editing the [Crimson and
Gray,]{.epub-i} Atlanta's alumni magazine, and captaining the debating
team than to coaching the football team, all of which he did with
considerable success. Sixty years later, emeritus professor Towns would
still take brisk early morning walks and repair his own roof. Almost as
courtly as Du Bois, but without the sartorial flourishes, he shared with
Du Bois not only their mutual admiration of Du Bois but also a deep
belief in higher education for
African-Americans.[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-29){#cha-29}
Towns was already more alarmed about Booker Washington's philosophy than
his older friend---and ready to shout out in public his delight over the
editorial grenades that Harvard man Monroe Trotter began lobbing at the
Tuskegee Machine late in 1901.

Over at Atlanta Baptist College for Men, just a few blocks from Atlanta
University, John Hope taught classics, served as bookkeeper, and coached
the future Morehouse College's first football teams. The same age as Du
Bois, Hope became not only his most intimate male friend but one with
whom Du Bois always dealt as an equal. Hope's wife, Lugenia, was a tall,
attractive Chicagoan with a pioneering interest in the YWCA and social
work; she would become as much a professional presence as her husband.
Lugenia Burns Hope was not a talkative woman, and her horn-rimmed
spectacles made her seem older and somewhat icy. She and Nina may not
have made a good fit. John Hope was exceedingly handsome in a stern sort
of way, with blue eyes and slightly wavy brown hair that he parted in
the middle. He wore an easy confidence and had risen to the top of his
class at Worcester Academy and Brown University, in tribute to which
(for such was the notion of liberalism in those days) the white faculty
and students had generally shut their eyes to the fact that he was a
Negro. The Brown faculty had been so determined to save Hope from going
out into the world as a Negro that on the eve of his graduation a small
committee begged him to reconsider. He had been a founding editor of the
Brown [Daily Herald,]{.epub-i} whose advisory committee offered him a
post on the Providence [Journal,]{.epub-i} as a white man. Instead,
after delivering the 1894 class oration the next day, he left campus and
headed back to the South as a voluntary black
man.[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-30){#cha-30}

Hope's life story was fabulous, so much so that it became the subject of
a fine biography, [The Story of John Hope,]{.epub-i} Ridgely Torrence's
forgotten masterpiece. Fanny, his mother, was the slave mistress of an
Augusta, Georgia, businessman, just as Alethea, her own mother, had been
of an Augusta planter. Alethea was almost white herself, beautiful by
Caucasian standards, accomplished, and farseeing enough to insist that
Fanny be sent to a school for mulattoes in Charleston, South Carolina.
James Hope, the Scots businessman who established the Augusta
Manufacturing Company (one of the South's few textile mills), lost his
head over Fanny, installed her in his town house, the center of Augusta
cultural life, and then, with the Civil War about to erupt, took her and
their children to New York City where the new firm of James Hope and
Company, Dealers in Imported Wines and Liquors, was established at 125th
Street and Third Avenue in the remote borough of Harlem. Years before,
James had sold his share of the prestigious old firm of Acker, Merrall,
and Condit, the family's New York business, to his brother, Thomas. No
satisfactory explanation is offered as to why James decided to return
with Fanny to Augusta, spending the war there in his elegant Ellis
Street home. In 1867, he placed the property in her name. The following
year, in June, John was born there.

There were other families like the Hopes in Augusta, as there were
elsewhere in the Deep South, octoroon and quadroon mixtures on their way
to often neurotic, either/or racial identities. Fifteen years after the
Civil War, these men and women of the third race were being treated no
differently from any other ""niggers"" (unless they escaped by ""passing""),
but until then, in many enclaves within the prostrate Confederacy, they
sometimes lived privileged lives. ""There was always a choice group,""
Hope told a riveted audience many years later, ""a choice few who
defeated circumstances. Then there was the group of people who
independent of particular merit on their part, but because of
circumstances, their relationships to their masters, received additional
money or additional education and were to that extent ahead."" Channing
Tobias, a much younger product of similar Augusta heritage and destined
for comparable professional-service renown with the national YMCA,
explained that ""it was possible for a Negro in the Augusta of John
Hope's boyhood to aspire to the heights and to receive encouragement
from white people in so
doing.""[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-31){#cha-31} Until James
Hope's death in 1876, Fanny and her children shared fully in the
reflected status and power of Augusta's most distinguished white
citizen. Yet five years later, Fanny was nearly destitute, not a dollar
of the monies left in trust having been paid out by Hope's three white
executors, and only a slender annuity eventually forthcoming as a result
of a suit filed on her behalf by Thomas Hope of New York.

As the family slipped behind the veil, John worked in Augusta's finest
hotel (owned by a black man) and learned to take hard knocks, monetary
and racial. Before reaching his teens, something happened across the
Savannah River in the town of Hamburg, South Carolina, that served to
fix his sense of racial identity unshakably. It was the sort of event
that was becoming more and more frequent in the South, and having
similar self-defining impact on great numbers of racially indeterminate
young men and women. Hamburg was a center of black power in
Reconstruction South Carolina, with a black justice of the peace among
its elected officials, and an armed militia drilled to readiness by
proud, black Union Army veteran ""Doc"" Adams. The state's Democrats
determined to make a stand at Hamburg in the summer of 1876 in order to
galvanize white voters and thereby deny the Republicans and their
African-American supporters victory at the polls. The manufactured
incident, during the militia's Fourth of July parade, led to a pitched
battle that evening, with hundreds of armed white people crossing over
from Augusta to join the attack on Adams's outgunned forces. At
nightfall, after surrendering the armory from which they had battled the
invaders and their artillery, a number of the black militiamen were
slaughtered in cold blood and the town's stores and shops torched.
Eight-year-old John Hope heard white men shouting, ""This is the
beginning of the redemption of South Carolina,"" and saw the red glow
across the river. If there was to be a war of the races, Hope signed on
early as a black man. ""And remember,"" he was in the habit of remarking,
""I heard the guns of the Hamburg
Massacre.""[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-32){#cha-32}

Coming to Atlanta in the fall of 1898 from Roger Williams University, a
tiny black Baptist college in Nashville, Hope sensed that he was being
groomed for the presidency of Atlanta Baptist Seminary, then headed by a
white Canadian. Before moving to the state capital in 1879, Atlanta
Baptist Seminary had been Augusta Institute. The Hopes enjoyed a special
family connection to both academies. The founder of Augusta Institute,
William Jefferson White, was another forceful racial question mark.
White had dared to violate Georgia law by teaching African-American
children their ABCs before the Civil War. Like James Hope, he fell in
love with a woman of African ancestry. But Josephine Thomas was still
owned by a master who refused to sell her. White solved the problem by
marrying her and going to live in the home of Josephine's master as a
black man. After the Civil War, he took up preaching, founded and edited
the [Georgia Baptist,]{.epub-i} for years the most widely read
African-American newspaper in the South, and placed his lanky
Anglo-Saxon frame, flashing blue eyes, and spellbinding vocals in the
service of African-American uplift. An admiring Du Bois described him as
""editor, educator, and leader, \[who\] held a hundred thousand people in
the hollow of his
hand.""[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-33){#cha-33} Heading for the
presidency of White's transplanted college, Hope had to be careful about
what he said and did. As a rule, he managed to pair unobsequious
diplomacy with staunch principles. When it came to the phenomenon of
Booker Washington, however, his diplomacy was tested.

He said almost nothing in public, but with Du Bois and Towns he was
frank about what was coming to be called the Tuskegee Machine and its
philosophy. Hope was as alarmed as Towns by what he saw as the downhill
course the Wizard's leadership was taking. Then, too, he had an
advantage neither Towns nor Du Bois had. Hope had come to Atlanta from
Nashville in 1895 to hear Washington deliver his great ""cast down your
buckets"" speech at the Atlanta and Cotton States Exposition. A year
later, during Roger Williams University's commemoration of George
Washington's birthday, Hope's thoughts about the Atlanta Compromise had
boiled over in a speech to faculty and students. ""If we are not striving
for equality,"" he cried, ""in heaven's name for what are we living?"" He
said it was cowardly and dishonest for ""our colored men to tell white
people or colored people that we are not struggling for equality....
Yes, my friends, I want equality. Nothing less."" And savoring its shock
value, Hope had wound up: ""I am going to say we demand [social]{.epub-i}
equality.""[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-34){#cha-34} These
feelings were so strong that he was ready to act upon them publicly,
opposing the vast forces supporting Washington. On the other hand, it
would have been in character, and in keeping with their friendship, for
Hope to act as a moderating influence on Du Bois once the latter's own
conflict with Washington deepened.

As Du Bois and his circle studied the balance sheet of the past five
years, from 1895 to 1900, they found their apprehensions growing the
more Booker Washington's feats of conciliation were extolled by others.
Yet there was no gainsaying his influence in the highest places, his
manifold services to his people, and, above all, the radiating influence
of Tuskegee's good works. For the present, he was indispensable and
untouchable. As for Washington himself, at first he good-naturedly
discounted such fears and suspicions about his secular ministry as rank
jealousy at worst and deplorable naivete at best. He was certain that he
understood the real world and the real black and white people living in
it. He saw with penetration through to the state of nature ""red in tooth
and claw"" behind the nation's social and racial contract---behind the
institutional, legal, and customary facade of the free market economy.
Andrew Carnegie recognized in him a black version of his better self,
and, when Washington was his guest at Skibo Castle in Scotland,
delighted in ""darky"" stories and political
homespun.[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-35){#cha-35} The Wizard
of Tuskegee was much less sagacious when it came to the broader
implications of the Industrial Revolution for the South.

The South was Washington's specialty, the region whose fabulous creation
he was from earliest formation as Mrs. Viola Ruffner's Malden, West
Virginia, houseboy to General Armstrong's ""no ordinary darkey"" student
at Hampton.[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-36){#cha-36} If Du
Bois's considerable and growing knowledge of the black South was,
nevertheless, akin to a professional explorer's knowledge of Africa or
the Amazon, Washington [was]{.epub-i} the black South---the peasant
South arrayed with honorary degrees. Half white himself (ignorant of his
father's identity and of his own birth date, he liked to say that his
existence at least was certain), he was a veritable tangle of the
South's taboos, paradoxes, and feudal intimacies. Therefore, Washington
was a southern black man who understood southern white men to the
marrow. His views of Du Bois's much-discussed concept of
African-American ""two-ness"" do not survive, but Washington could well
have claimed to possess something like ""three-ness""---the consciousness
of being an American, a Negro, and, more perilously yet, an American
Negro in the South.

The joke about Washington, that he never met a white man he didn't like,
was precisely that---a joke. His gift (one Du Bois neither possessed nor
wanted) was almost never to show his dislikes. The stakes were too high.
If Ms. Calhoun of Cambridge and Mr. Washington [Bee]{.epub-i} deplored
his placatory pronouncements, it was because they had never experienced
the white-sheeted fury engendered by a lack of obsequiousness. Less than
a year after the Atlanta speech had made Washington a household name,
the governor of Alabama had figuratively slapped him down in public.
Apparently riled up by the proud manner in which the African-American
customs collector of Wilmington, North Carolina, had delivered an
otherwise Tuskegee-correct commencement address, Governor William C.
Oates had torn up his prepared speech and given the Tuskegee assembly a
red-faced dressing down. ""I want to give you niggers a few words of
plain talk and advice,"" he spluttered. ""You might as well understand
that this is a white man's country, as far as the South is concerned,
and we are going to make you keep your place. Understand that."" The
Wizard rose, calling for prayer, and promptly terminated the
proceedings. The etiquette of race relations was no less touch and go in
the North. His boldest public moment, when he lectured white America on
its civil rights obligations to black America at the 1898 Chicago Peace
Jubilee, had practically been erased from the record when the Associated
Press simply omitted his words. Washington complained to a white
newspaper editor who had heard alarming accounts of it, that, ""in a
portion of my address which was not sent out,"" he had said nothing more
radical than that ""the Negro be given every opportunity in proportion as
he makes himself
worthy.""[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-37){#cha-37}

Taught by such rebukes that there were no percentages in publicly
advocating more than the right of African-Americans to live and work
within the scheme ordained by the rich and powerful South and North,
Washington increasingly moderated his moderation---the duties of the
race rather than the rights it was denied were tirelessly, anecdotally
emphasized. ""When it gets down to hard pan,"" he told his northern
mainstay T. Thomas Fortune, ""it is hard to give an individual or race
influence that it does not intrinsically possess."" To his credit,
whenever pinned down about fundamental rights, Washington, in statements
usually cast in the negative and balanced on the faults of both races,
declined to renounce outright the protections under the Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments of the Constitution. ""I do not favor the Negro's
giving up anything which is fundamental and which has been guaranteed to
him by the Constitution,"" he stated on one notable occasion. ""It is not
best for him to relinquish his rights; nor would his doing so be best
for the Southern white man."" But it was quiet diplomacy and practical
deeds that mattered. He came to expect the same approach from others,
sincerely believing and publicly advising that what men and women said
about racial injustice was more often than not unwise and, in any case,
less important than what they did. The Wizard's white ghostwriter and
future Chicago University sociologist Robert Park recalled that, after
fifteen minutes or more ticking off first-hand instances of racial
cruelty in the South, his new employer calmly interrupted to suggest
that Park spend his time figuring out what to do about
them.[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-38){#cha-38}

Although only a few influential white men and women within the Tuskegee
inner circle knew of it at the time, historians have now unearthed the
Wizard's impressive record of secret civil rights maneuverings.
""Pitchfork Ben"" Tillman, Tom Watson, James Vardaman, and the South's
other redneck populists went to their graves never suspecting that much
of the organized resistance to the extinction of the African-American as
a civil being originated in the upstairs study of Tuskegee's principal.
Having spoken directly to the Louisiana legislature about voting rights
in 1898, he worked behind the scenes to raise legal fees from wealthy
whites in an unsuccessful effort to test the constitutionality of
Louisiana's grandfather clause in the courts. He played the same covert
role three years later in his own state of Alabama, failing again with
the legislature, but doggedly lobbying and funneling monies for a legal
assault on the state's new disfranchisement clauses. He reached out to
the antidisfranchisement forces in Maryland, where, for a change, they
were strong enough to win. Court battles against Pullman car
discrimination on the railroads in Tennessee, Georgia, and Virginia had
his full if invisible backing---usually through the screen of the
Afro-American Council. Lawyers fighting racial exclusion from juries in
Alabama and Texas looked to him for a portion of their retainers. He
savored a rare victory in a hard-fought, infamous case involving Alonzo
Bailey, a dirt-poor Alabama farmer forcibly returned to his white
employer's farm, having had the cheek to leave owing twenty dollars. The
U. S. Supreme Court, grown somnolent in matters involving the rights of
black people and laborers, finally roused itself to outlaw peonage
(enslavement by contract), although the apparent technicalities were
such that the court was unable to find a remedy for Mr. Bailey's
specific predicament. Hardly surprising, then, that less than a month
after seeking endorsement for the assistant superintendency in the
District of Columbia, a furious Du Bois was writing Washington about
hauling the Southern Railway before the Interstate Commerce Commission
for its refusal to sell him a sleeping berth on account of
race.[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-39){#cha-39}

Being leader of his race was more than a notion, Washington must often
have thought, sighing, off the record, that in a two-year period he
""spent at least four thousand dollars in cash, out of my own pocketÂ ...
in advancing the rights of the black man."" But if all the machination,
manipulation, and dissembling had had no higher purpose than the mere
physical survival of black people in the South, as well as the greater
glory of Tuskegee Institute, Booker Washington's program would not have
been so much tragic as pathetic. If he was the Machiavelli of the Black
Belt, the Wizard of Tuskegee, like his Renaissance precursor, dreamed of
noble ends even as he schemed ignobly. As his biographer discloses,
Washington believed---and he had to believe it absolutely---that he
personified the Faustian bargain into which his people had entered with
the best elements of the white South and the wealthiest elements of the
white North. The deal had been sealed at Atlanta in 1895: in exchange
for docility in politics and discipline in work (and not even a whisper
of social equality), African-Americans in the South were guaranteed due
process in law, book learning for life's routines, and the opportunity
to prosper economically, while the North, released from any moral,
political, and constitutional duty to meddle, would provide money and
personnel to make Henry Woodfin Grady's New South dream a
reality.[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-40){#cha-40}

The deal was struck with the survivors of the old planter class and the
allied new class of bankers, mill owners, railroad vice-presidents, mine
owners, and furnishing merchants who had reclaimed the South from
Reconstruction. Heterogeneous in background and disputatious in
politics, they were variously called ""Redeemers"" or ""Bourbons"" or
""Conservatives."" Until the early 1890s, what had united them was a
strategy (masterfully implemented by the likes of Mississippi senator
Lucius Quintus Lamar and South Carolina governor Wade Hampton) of using
poor black people to control poor white people and their rising cousins.
By poll taxes, residency requirements, literacy laws, stuffed ballot
boxes, and a host of discriminatory devices, the conservatives had
tilted the electoral process heavily in their favor, disfranchising as
many as a fourth of the white males who otherwise could have voted in
many of the states of the former Confederacy. Twice as many if not more
African-Americans were excluded in the same way---and by stronger
measures ranging from economic reprisals to vigilante mayhem. Reliable
estimates put the number of African-Americans in the South still voting
by the early 1890s near 40 percent. Yet for many lower-class whites for
whom the ballot had been an obstacle instead of a passport to
advancement, this was far too many. For other whites determined to hold
on to power or to challenge it, the rump African-American vote remained
a temptation and, not infrequently, a trump card. ""The greatest danger
that threatens Democratic supremacy in the South,"" a leading white
newspaper warned in 1883, ""is that the 'out' faction always gravitates
toward the Negro and secures his aid to rout the
'ins.'""[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-41){#cha-41} With the
economic downturn beginning in the late 1880s, this situation had become
volatile, with hardscrabble white people mobilizing behind Populist
candidates and formerly quiescent black people awakening to their new
balance-of-power opportunities. Overproduction had driven cotton from
its 1870 high of twenty-nine cents a bale to five cents by 1890,
threatening to drag Bourbon hegemony down with it. This had always been
the white supremacist's nightmare, one inherent in southern politics so
long as the African-American survived as a voter; and now loomed the
even greater specter of a black and white coalition of empowered
farmers.

It did not happen, and ten years after Booker Washington famously spoke
in Atlanta, the nightmare and the specter were fast receding from the
southern white consciousness. Where 130,344 African-Americans had been
registered voters in Louisiana in 1896, 5,320 remained on the rolls four
years later. After 1900, there were some 3,000 registered voters in
Alabama out of a black male voting-age population of 181,471.
Constitutional conventions in one southern state after another had, by
1910, ""counted the Negro down and out,"" as one politician put it. Poor
white people no longer needed to battle against Bourbon rule shored up
by the Negro. The conservatives no longer needed dread biracial
coalitions of taxing and regulating farmers. And so it became the task
of the Wizard of Tuskegee to sanction what in any case he had absolutely
no power to prevent---to sell it as a bargain, a compromise, an
accommodation; to denounce and renounce the so-called Reconstruction
experiment and hold out seductive prospects of a distant but realizable
racial parity based on the unifying dollar rather than the divisive
ballot. ""Harmony will come in proportion as the black man gets something
the white man wants,"" he preached. ""Any movement for the elevation of
the Southern Negro in order to be successful, must have to a certain
extent the cooperation of the Southern whites. They control the
government and own the
property.""[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-42){#cha-42}

But the fatal flaw in the bargain was that the conservatives who
controlled the legislatures in the 1895 South were even then losing
power or being forced to share more of it with the rising radicals. The
courtly squires of antebellum days---the Haygoods, Currys, Hamptons, and
Lamars (even Governor Oates who gave the Tuskegee dressing-down)---were
in retreat across Dixie before the Vardamans, Aycocks, Heflins, and
Tillmans. Conservative disfranchisement, historian Joel Williamson has
written, had been ""marked by a willingness to leave the best of the
blacks enfranchised and, conversely, to disfranchise the worst of the
whites."" Vardaman of Mississippi, his lustrous brown hair flying, spoke
plainly for the radicals: ""I am just as opposed to Booker Washington as
a voter, with all his Anglo-Saxon reenforcements, as I am to the
coconut-headed, chocolate-colored, typical little coon, Andy Dotson, who
blacks my shoes every
evening.""[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-43){#cha-43} As these men
and their followers captured the statehouses, the margin of maneuver for
African-Americans would dwindle almost to nothing, not only in the
political sphere but also in practically every other arena.

But it was not at first the unraveling of the politics of accommodation
that outraged Du Bois and the small number of mostly northern, urban,
and college-educated men and women soon to be known as the Talented
Tenth. Washington's stratagem had seemed plausible enough---at least for
a time---as a political approach to race relations. But its cultural
dimensions dismayed and finally alienated those African-Americans (like
Du Bois, Towns, Hope, Trotter, Chicago social reformer Ida
Wells-Barnett, and others) for whom higher education was not merely a
passport to social and professional standing but the master key to
collective empowerment as well. When the Great Accommodator derided
Latin and philosophy and French on platforms across the country, Du Bois
felt mocked in the very center of his considerable self-significance.
""The proud fop with his beaver hat, kid gloves, and walking cane"" was
the bane, said Washington, of the practical black men of goodwill intent
upon spreading the gospel of industrial education in the South. ""I
believe dis darkey am called to preach,"" the punch line of another of
the Wizard's platform favorites, colorfully reinforced the stereotype of
shiftless Negroes ever ready to dodge useful
labor.[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-44){#cha-44} Increasingly,
it seemed to Du Bois, darky jokes were giving way to jokes about
high-falutin' city types. Du Bois and his peers might agree with
Washington that a dollar in hand was worth far more to most of their
people than a box seat at the opera, but they bridled when the Wizard
suggested that higher degrees were a cover for distinguished indolence.

Interestingly, the Wizard gave Hampton students their 1898 commencement
marching orders just as Du Bois returned to Fisk for the first time in
ten years on a similar mission. Echoing Washington, he told Fiskites
that African-Americans must grow into ""a source of strength and power
instead of a menace and a burden to the nation."" ""Captains of industry""
were desperately needed. Du Bois stressed repeatedly on that day that a
great variety of educations and occupations had to be fostered. But if
all honest labor was essential, his ""Careers Open to College-Bred
Negroes"" made it clear that Fisk men and women were not meant to be
Pullman porters. ""Even the higher branches of house-serviceÂ ... and the
great field of skilled labor"" were to be left to the skilled graduates
of our ""great industrial schools,"" he advised. They must understand that
Fisk was special, that they were destined to go forth to sound the
trumpet awakening their ""dark historic race."" With old classmate Proctor
on the dais, Du Bois recalled his exaltation ten commencement mornings
past. Winding up on an elitist note that Washington would never have
played at Hampton or Tuskegee, he commanded, ""Remember next that you are
gentlemen and ladies, trained in the liberal arts and subjects in that
vast kingdom of culture that has lighted the world from its infancy and
guided it through bigotry and falsehood and
sin.""[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-45){#cha-45} Du Bois's
concept of a saving elite took another step toward completion that
morning.

In the role of educator, then, Washington was becoming too much for Du
Bois to bear. Conflict hung over both men like heavily seeded clouds,
although the year 1901 seemed to be passing with a fair prospect of no
cloudburst until [Up From Slavery]{.epub-i} appeared. The March edition
of the [Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i} carried Du Bois's scholarly,
historical evaluation of the work of the Freedmen's Bureau. In June,
another piece of Black Belt scholarship, ""The Negro As He Really Is,""
appeared in [World's Work.]{.epub-i} That same month saw his very
favorable [Harper's Weekly]{.epub-i} article on the accomplishments of
the Tuskegee conferences, further indication of social scientist Du Bois
seemingly too busy for the passions and distractions of
partisanship.[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-46){#cha-46}
Meanwhile, [Up From Slavery,]{.epub-i} ghostwritten by Max Bennett
Thrasher, a white Vermont newspaperman and released by Doubleday, Page
and Company in late February, was a stupendous success. ""Negro"" was
rendered in upper case (almost unprecedented for a major publishing
house). The story was vintage American: faith in God and hard, hard work
overcoming bleakest adversity. The cast of edifying characters included
an unlettered, devoted mother, aristocratic and kindly white families,
the white matron who admitted him to Hampton after a parlor-sweeping
examination, father-figure General Armstrong and his ""gospel of the
tooth-brush,"" the visionary ex-slave, Lewis Adams, who negotiated
Tuskegee's existence, Washington's self-sacrificing wives, and good
friend Andrew Carnegie.

William Dean Howells, called by some the dean of American letters, was
enthusiastic in his long [North American Review]{.epub-i} praise of
author Washington, noting somewhat critically only that the Tuskegee
principal evinced ""rather more tolerance for the rich than the New
Testament expresses."" Du Bois's old professor, Barrett Wendell,
trumpeted the autobiography's ""manly distinctness,"" and the U.S.
commissioner of education judged it ""one of the great books of the
year."" Industrialist George Eastman's rave review reached Tuskegee in
the form of a check and a message: ""I cannot dispose of five thousand
dollars to any better advantage than to send it to you for your
institute.""[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-47){#cha-47} Then came
a review of the book in the July 16 issue of [Dial]{.epub-i} unlike any
other. ""It is as though Nature must needs make men a little narrow to
give them force,"" Du Bois began tersely. Neither originality nor
sophistication had propelled Washington to the leadership of his race.
Industrial education was already a full-blown doctrine before Washington
became an educator. Racial accommodation had been advocated and
practiced long before he was anointed the Great Accommodator. This
leader's singularity lay elsewhere, in Washington's astute reading of
his age, his native understanding of his region, and in the ""unlimited
energy and perfect faith he put into this programme""---his changing of
""a by-path into a Veritable Way of Life."" Conceding the ""honest purpose
which is accomplishing something,"" Du Bois fair-mindedly recalled the
stubborn, instinctive opposition to Washington's work among those
anchored to the older abolitionist faith and others suspicious of
southern white people. Who but Washington had ever before possessed the
""tact and power"" to command ""not simply the applause of those who
believe in his theories, but also the respect of those who do not\[?\]""
The danger of all this, however, was that the success of Washington's
ideas threatened to overwhelm perspective and proportion. The nub of the
concern was that Washington had ""learned so thoroughly the speech and
thought of triumphant commercialismÂ ... that he pictures as the height
of absurdity a black boy studying a French grammar in the midst of weeds
and dirt. One wonders,"" Du Bois asked with rhetorical mischief, ""how
Socrates or St. Francis of Assisi would receive
this!""[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter10-48){#cha-48}

The real task that Du Bois set himself in the [Dial]{.epub-i} review was
twofold: first, to demystify Washington by placing his leadership in the
context of the sociology of politics; and, second, to identify and
explicate for mainstream America the existence within Afro-America of a
loyal opposition to Washington. The means by which groups select their
champions was one of the ""nicest problems of social growth,"" Professor
Du Bois disclosed. For ""beleaguered"" or ""imprisoned groups"" the
structure of survival could take three main forms---revolt and revenge,
accommodation to the major group, or self-development. Washington's was
simply one of the possible leadership paradigms. Toussaint L'Ouverture,
Richard Allen, Nat Turner, Blanche Bruce, and Frederick Douglass
represented other leadership models. African-American leadership
selection was peculiarly vulnerable to distortion and cooptation by the
majority group. Coming ""with a clear simple programme at the
psychological moment,"" the Wizard was a phenomenon of a time when the
nation was a little ashamed of having ""bestowed so much sentiment on
Negroes and was concentrating on dollars."" Du Bois spelled out the who
and why of the opposition, which must have come as unwelcome news to
most white readers. This opposition was committed to self-determination,
a ""large and important group represented by Dunbar, Tanner, Chesnutt,
Miller, and the GrimkÃ©s."" These men and women believed ""in the higher
education of Fisk and Atlanta Universities; they believe in
self-assertion and ambition; and they believe in the right of suffrage
for blacks on the same terms with whites."" This ""important group"" was
not at all large, and its members were little known, but, in announcing
what they stood for, Du Bois had fired the opening salvo in the war
between the Tuskegee Machine and the Talented Tenth.

A[TLANTA]{.epub-sc}

[Scholar Behind the Veil]{.epub-bi}

H[ALFWAY THROUGH]{.epub-sc} his thirty-seventh year, as the Niagara
Movement was starting up, Du Bois remained outwardly motivated and
organized in his professional activities, doing work that would have
taxed a committee of scholars. Even so, his leadership role in the
battle with Booker T. Washington not only increasingly distracted him,
the impact of that burgeoning contest on funds for his own research and
the financial health of Atlanta University became more stifling month by
month. ""I kept on writing and publishing \[but\] not with as much
concentration of effort as I ought to have had,"" he recalled, adding,
however, with wry understatement that he had still done so ""with some
effectiveness."" Articles and essays flowed from his pen, a major
biography was under way, and, while tending to the esprit de corps of
his Niagarites, Du Bois continued to organize and edit for publication
the annual conferences for which he was now nationally and becoming
internationally known. The secret of his remarkable activity lay in the
work routine he developed at some point between his Berlin days and the
early Atlanta years. The regimen was formulated on lengths of graph
paper on which each day of the week was segmented into precisely timed
tasks that began after breakfast and ended, invariably, at nine in the
evening. Bed by ten always, he would acquire a habit of saying later
when asked to explain his excellent health in old age. As the years
passed, the work charts would grow longer, scroll-like, covering whole
desk tops and segmenting entire months in their rectilinear
discipline---so much history, philosophy, or sociology read before
eleven; so many pages of a monograph or novel written after lunch;
essays and book reviews polished off before dictating institutional
correspondence by dinnertime; so many letters to friends composed after
dinner, and a work of fiction read until
bedtime.[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-1){#cha-1}

Admired by visitors, Du Bois remained isolated and ignored by the white
people of the city that his extraordinary labors were putting on the map
of social science. Becoming a tale of two cities, the capital of the New
South was a place in which black and white people possessed angry and
embarrassed memories of a fast-receding epoch of more informal and
comparatively flexible racial separation. Nothing symbolized the
arbitrary and outcast status more humiliatingly than the total ban
enforced by Atlanta's white people on the Talented Tenth's admission to
the city's new public library, an ornate, well-stocked building that was
the largest of its kind in the South. Du Bois railed against an
exclusion that must, of all exclusions, have been hard to bear. What
right had the City of Atlanta to take money ""raised from the taxes of
black and white"" for the use of one race only, he demanded in a
""Petition of Negroes to Use the Carnegie Library."" Fortunate in having a
handful of stimulating academic colleagues, traveling much in the North,
and able to measure himself during the annual conferences against some
of the nation's finest minds and major influences, Du Bois kept fully
abreast of the contemporary intellectual ferment. But astute observers
perceived something of his almost always tightly, proudly disguised
suffering in purgatory. And sometimes Du Bois frankly confessed it. He
had ""often thought of what you told me about the gulf fixed between you
and the white people of Atlanta,"" a northern white acquaintance wrote
him. Then, too, as Columbia University's outstanding professor of
economics, Edwin Seligman, himself Jewish, wrote, ""A Litany at Atlanta""
was really a public avowal of ""the horror of it all"" and the ""tragedy
for men like you---a tragedy all the greater because of the seeming
impasse.""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-2){#cha-2} Atlanta was
surely the major component in that arresting metaphor in [Dusk of
Dawn]{.epub-i} summing up a phase of his life, a life crucified on a
vast wheel of time, whereon he ""flew round and round with the Zeitgeist,
waving my pen and lifting faint voices to explain, expound, and
exhort.""[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-3){#cha-3}

He could whirl with the Zeitgeist, but Nina was pretty much stuck.
Walking the two-mile stretch to downtown Atlanta because she, like so
many of her middle-class peers, refused to patronize the segregated
transit system, Nina never knew when a shopping errand (often delayed
until unavoidable) would end in an incident. It galled her to have to
wait until every white customer had been served before a drawling
department-store clerk deigned to recognize her. Along her route, there
was not a single water fountain or park bench lawfully permitted to
Negroes. Her Will could sublimate much of his outrage at Atlanta's
racial grossness in letters to editors, [Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i}
essays, and sociological studies. Nina was shy, intellectually average,
and, like most women of her era and class, corseted by mores and
conventions that prevented much of action, adventure, and variety. She
was becoming a shadowy, silent figure seen less and less in public with
or without her husband, a devoted---excessively devoted---mother to
spunky, chubby, large-boned Yolande. If Lugenia Hope---an unusual woman
able to combine her domestic and maternal duties as a distinguished
professional's wife and mother with her own social-work involvement in
slum improvement---ever offered discreet mentoring, Nina was emotionally
poorly equipped (and probably never encouraged by Du Bois) to respond.
The Atlanta riot had, in fact, actually been something of a mixed
blessing because Will eventually decided that she should take Yolande to
Great Barrington for the school
year.[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-4){#cha-4}

The surviving letters from the early Atlanta years (and they are not
numerous) reveal almost nothing of her inner feelings, her emotional
needs during the period. In one letter (one of the earliest), Nina tells
Will about baby Yolande searching for him in his study and saying, when
told where he was, ""'why I know he's gone away and its useless to look
for him.'"" ""Useless to look for him"" may have been Nina speaking through
Yolande, for she added wistfully, ""We are very lonely evenings here
alone."" Even when Will was home, he may not have been there for her.
They had drifted apart to such a degree that Bazolene Usher noticed how
often ""Dr. Du Bois was cranky"" and how little he and Mrs. Du Bois seemed
to interact. Psychological cause and effect are seldom obvious, and from
this distance in time they are murky in the extreme. Whether Burghardt's
death wedged between them or whether they allowed it to push them apart
because there was so little holding them together in the first place,
each felt increasingly alienated from the other. Nina concentrated
fussily and determinedly on their daughter, watching over her
constantly, niggardly apportioning Yolande's playtime with the few
children approved for contact, and having her clothing washed over and
over. She behaved as though the hated city were only waiting to strike
Yolande down and take her away like Burghardt. The absence of available
public parks, the considerable distance to the other side of the city
where a few more eligible children resided, and the proximity of slums
like Buttermilk Bottom, crammed with unsavory adults and dirty children,
nourished maternal fixation and unhealthy protectiveness, as did her own
psychosomatic ups and downs. By the time Will finally made it possible
to escape Atlanta, Nina had become prey to chronic ailments of a
nonspecific character. ""I am feeling some better today,"" her last
surviving letter from this period ends. ""I hope it will
last.""[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-5){#cha-5}

The best of husbands and fathers would have been sorely challenged by Du
Bois's research and writing schedule, but, as Du Bois himself confessed,
he was no model husband or father under any circumstances. He loved
Yolande, and that love would be constant until she died. Seldom finding
time to spend with her, he tried to express his affections periodically
by letter. One Sunday in March 1907, after dictating letters into the
gramophone in the South Hall apartment, it occurred to him there was
just space enough on the record to address one to Yolande in Great
Barrington. He wondered what she was doing, supposed she must be in bed
at that moment, and told her that he missed her. Yet in this rare, early
letter, Du Bois showed how almost inevitably he connected thoughts of
his daughter to the real substance of his life. ""But most of all,"" he
said in closing, ""I think papa misses you when he comes in and has
nobody to interrupt his work. He'd be very glad to have you interrupt
his work a little while
now.""[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-6){#cha-6} Wife and daughter
were increasingly subordinated to the intellectual care and feeding of
the African-American people. And even if he had been totally immune to
the domestic insensibilities of most Edwardian males, which he was not,
Du Bois would have sincerely believed that his unique insights and
training amounted to a covenant with his people to serve them and, if
possible, save them from a future as blighted as their past had been
sorrowful. Zeitgeist prevailed over hearth.

The 1905 Atlanta University Studies Conference convened at the end of
May as usual. The tenth in the series, it resulted in what was probably
the most comprehensive bibliography on the African-American then
available. But ""Select Bibliography of the Negro American"" was not Du
Bois's main objective, and he was rather harsh on himself for having
compiled what he decided was ""a very imperfect"" document. What was
really significant about this tenth conference, he emphasized, was that
it commenced a reformulation of all that had gone before. Each of the
studies conducted thus far was to be repeated with greater amplitude and
depth in ten-year cycles so as to provide social science with a firmer
grasp of what was invariable, contingent, and evolving in the racial
group whose unmatched authority Du Bois had become. The loyal Hershaw
was among the participants, as well as the wife of Niagarite Butler
Wilson of Boston, Mary Evans, who was as much a racial militant and
public activist as her husband. But the drawing power of the conferences
was now such that Frances Kellor, the white New York social reformer,
fresh from organizing the Inter-Municipal Committee on Household
Research, accepted Du Bois's invitation to Atlanta. Writing Du Bois that
she and her associates had been scandalized by the working and lodging
conditions of black females, Kellor hurried to Atlanta to become better
informed.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-7){#cha-7} In 1906, she
and Ruth Baldwin (even more active since the death of husband William)
would establish the influential National League for the Protection of
Colored Women.

Mary Ovington's arrival on campus was especially gratifying. By then,
she and Du Bois had developed an unbuttoned intimacy in their
correspondence, she the admiring novice, he the uncharacteristically
chatty preceptor. When Ovington wrote how she had ached over his
""Credo,"" Du Bois shared with her a secret psychic aspect of civil rights
leadership, the elation that came to him from living deeply and
defiantly in an evil world---""after all, there are wonderful
compensations in all this thing."" One compensation was the money
Ovington began to remit for the Atlanta Studies, small but badly needed
amounts she raised from such good-works patrons as V. Everit Macy,
William Schieffelin, and Jacob Schiff. ""Have I then been entertaining a
millionaire unawares---a mere millionaire?"" a grateful Du Bois
teased.[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-8){#cha-8} Initially, he had
been merely intrigued by her, and appreciative of her fan letters and
modest financial contributions to Atlanta University, but gradually his
respect for Ovington's solid social work credentials evoked his
admiration. Ovington had come home from a 1900 study tour of London's
East End slums shaken to the core, writing angrily in an unpublished
autobiographical fragment of the brutal social conditions thrown up by
capitalism---of ""the life so far from the beauty and health of the life""
that she had always known. Determinedly, she set out to change those
conditions, plunging into the work of Greenwich House, New York's first
neighborhood improvement association. She turned to socialism (a
well-mannered and rather patient variety of it) and soon to the plight
of African-American working women in New York. ""I want to get a model
tenement built in one of the crowded Negro quarters,"" she explained to
Du Bois, adding that she was determined to get some of the Phipps
settlement house money for that purpose, which she
did.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-9){#cha-9}

Meanwhile, she was reading everything on the subject of African-American
urban conditions. Her talks with settlement house doyenne Mary Kingsbury
Simkhovitch led her to Columbia's Franz Boas and the new anthropology
stressing nurture over nature. She sought out the wise African-American
pastor, William Henry Brooks, in his ""little study"" in St. Mark's
Episcopal Church in Brooklyn, and learned more about the needs of her
new interest. Philanthropist Henry Phipps eventually declined to finance
an entire settlement-house facility, but he gave Ovington enough to
build The Tuskegee, a model tenement. Her articles in influential
publications like [The Outlook]{.epub-i} had already afforded her a
level of respect that many veteran reformers never attained. A few years
after her first visit to Atlanta, Du Bois was recommending her writings
on urban black economic conditions as indispensable: ""She knows more
about it than anyone I
know.""[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-10){#cha-10} Much of what
Ovington knew about African-American urban conditions had come, after
all, from bibliographies and general advice that he had readily provided
her. Yet Ovington found that what she had to say about the potential of
black city-dwellers and the woeful inadequacy of industrial education as
a panacea quickly became unpopular. [McClure]{.epub-i}'s rejected her
article on tenement conditions as too upbeat. She claimed to have found
a surprising degree of domestic pride and cleanliness among poor
African-American families in New York. Their children as a rule were
""better trained than most of our city poor,"" Ovington added. The essay
eventually appeared in the [Colored American]{.epub-i} magazine. Oswald
Villard's New York [Evening Post]{.epub-i} and William Ward's
neoabolitionist [Independent]{.epub-i} took her pieces, but the rest of
the press disapproved of them. ""Du Bois had broken into the [Atlantic
Monthly]{.epub-i} by the sheer force of his genius,"" she sighed later,
""but no one could follow him."" In fact, Du Bois had found by then that
he could no longer follow
himself.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-11){#cha-11}

Ovington neither looked nor behaved like the stereotyped social
reformer. She was tall, blonde, and handsome, with ice-blue eyes and an
hourglass figure, the perfect product of old upper-crust Brooklyn
society. Du Bois's Harvard friend, Bob Lovett, who had known her when
she was at Radcliffe, described Ovington as ""austerely beautiful."" There
had been dalliances when she was in her early twenties, and a more than
casual relationship with the dashing John Milholland (""as sincere,
enthusiastic, lovable a friend as the Negro ever had"") perhaps was about
to begin. Ex-newspaperman Milholland was a manufacturer of pneumatic
message cylinders and founder of the Constitution League, something of a
forerunner of the American Civil Liberties Union. Large, ruddy,
handsome, and of Irish descent, he had become increasingly disillusioned
after 1900 with the Republican party's abandonment of the
African-American. Drawn to Booker T. Washington at first, he had been
introduced by the Tuskegeean to Du Bois. They had liked each other
instantly, which was unusual for Du Bois. Milholland and Ovington met
for the first time in January 1905 when she introduced him to settlement
house and tenement reform activities. Milholland was deeply religious
and married, which made Ovington's entrance into his life a small
earthquake. After comparing his and Ovington's diary entries for 1905,
Ovington's biographer believes they rendezvoused in the Adirondacks for
three weeks in July, where they became
lovers.[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-12){#cha-12}

But the first and steadfast passion in the life of this forty-year-old
woman was bettering the life of the poor and the abused. She had a
special talent for empathizing with gifted individuals whose abilities
were discounted or misunderstood by powerful white men, a perspective
owing much to gender and disenchantment of class. She came to understand
the workings of Du Bois's hair-trigger temperament and so was able a
number of times to repair the damage it caused in situations where
compromise and consensus were essential. Du Bois had practically
commanded Ovington's attendance at the 1905 conference, writing that he
""should like you to be here at Baccalaureate, May 28 and to stay until
Commencement, June 1."" She had once chaired a dinner in New York for
Booker Washington, heard him speak and found him too much the Pollyanna.
Du Bois, on the other hand, had excited her to a pitch of admiration
through his writings and letters---""it was impossible to read him and
not be moved."" Twenty years later, she was still impressed by Du Bois's
genius, its superb racial blending of French clarity and Dutch
doggedness, as she speculated, but above all of its ""African 'passion.'""
Du Bois was unusually frank with Ovington about race matters from the
beginning of their friendship. She would come about as close as any
white person ever would to being a confidante and advisor. A year after
her coming to Atlanta, he would write to her of his ""extreme contempt
and dislike"" for Fred Moore, the Bookerite publisher of the New York
[Age,]{.epub-i} of his certainty that the officers of the Association
for the Protection of Negro Women were ""largely crazy,"" of his esteem
for William Bulkley, the New York high school principal, and of the
well-intentioned mediocrity of another prominent
African-American.[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-13){#cha-13}

Ovington came to Atlanta at Du Bois's decree, therefore, dutifully and
joyously---as well as to write about the South for Villard's [Evening
Post.]{.epub-i} They met at long last in the Atlanta University dining
hall, where she took her seat beside Du Bois at dinner, marveling at his
head ""like Shakespeare's done in bronze."" He talked nonsense throughout
the meal just to show her, as he remarked in an aside to other faculty
at table, that he was not ""weeping all the time."" Du Bois's response to
Ovington that evening would be repeated many times in the future---a
teasing levity tinged, in her case, with innocent flirtation. They would
often behave as though they were or wished to become lovers, but,
despite Du Bois's considerable and tested appeal to intelligent women,
they almost certainly never were. A role Ovington would find herself
reluctantly having to assume in numerous crucial situations was that of
stern schoolmistress to the sulking star pupil Du Bois. But that evening
in the Atlanta University refectory, the auguries were bright. Her ""cup
of happiness"" at meeting him ""was full,"" notwithstanding the hostile
environment of the city.

Atlanta's color line was drawn ""more rigorouslyÂ ... with more gusto,
than in less commercial southern cities,"" Ovington noted; and she noted
further what was to her the delicious irony that the city had ""to endure
the knowledge that its most distinguished citizen was
black.""[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-14){#cha-14} Describing the
segregated cage in which Du Bois was forced to live, she dwelt on the
cruel paradox of admiring northern and European visitors stopping at
hotels ""into whose lobby he \[Du Bois\] might not step. They saw a caste
system as if a Brahmin had laid out the city. And to acquire wisdom,
they went up the hill to see this colored 'untouchable.'"" Ovington may
not actually have noticed the expression during their first meeting (a
feature that became more pronounced a few years later), but it was
unlikely to have been entirely absent at the time---that ""cruel look in
Du Bois's sensitive, poet's face"" that lurked somewhere about the
mouth---""a half sneer, a scorn."" She met Nina, the Herndons, the Hopes,
the Townses, and heard from the very light-skinned Mrs. Towns of her
husband's recent arrest for race mixing as he and she rode together in
their automobile into the city. Apartheid notwithstanding, the gallant
Max Barber collected Ovington from the campus for a bold sightseeing
ride into Atlanta with Ovington riding up front. ""He was evidently a
dare-devil,"" she
decided.[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-15){#cha-15}

Du Bois had managed an even more considerable coup in corralling
Professor Walter Willcox of Cornell and the U. S. Census Bureau. He and
Willcox had worked together closely, if not always harmoniously, on a
number of projects since the beginning of 1902, when Willcox had invited
Du Bois to recommend topics pertaining to ""Negro conditions"" for the
December 1904 annual meeting of the American Economic Association. Du
Bois had objected to some of Willcox's findings (""trying to spin a
solution of the Negro problem out of the inside of your office""),
especially to his 1904 monograph, bristling with data and heavy on
dogma, [Negroes in the United States.]{.epub-i} For Du Bois, race
prejudice was a sufficient explanation of black peoples' socioeconomic
shortcomings, whereas Willcox claimed to be ""an agnostic on the
subject."" Du Bois had agreed to affix his name to the special American
Economic Association's report to be presented to the 1904 convention,
""The Economic Position of the American Negro,"" only with great
reluctance after he and Willcox had sparred about percentages of
African-Americans engaged in farming and the number of families
supported by income from domestic
service.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-16){#cha-16}

Another participant in the 1905 conference was the Hull House official
and University of Chicago teaching-staff member Sophonisba P.
Breckinridge, descended from the leading family of Kentucky, consumed by
her mission to uplift and consternated that there might not be time
enough to fulfill it. Such was her social standing and reform reputation
that Ovington (hardly a parvenue herself) was almost beside herself with
delight at finding Breckinridge at the conference---""such a glorious
radical was a complete surprise."" Breckinridge was fresh from winning
her doctorate from the University of Chicago, the first ever awarded to
a woman in the field of political science. She and close Hull House
companion Julia Lathrop were driving forces in the Institute of Social
Science, which they would eventually transform into the University of
Chicago's unique Graduate School of Social Work Education, the
preeminent influence in social-work training in America. Breckinridge
must have had a good deal to say at the conference. No doubt she found
much nonsense being aired that had to be instantly set right. Later, in
an admiring note to Du Bois, she hoped he didn't think her ""plain
speaking at the University did more harm than good."" The dating of
another message is uncertain, but it cannot have been too long after the
tenth conference that Breckinridge wrote from Atlanta's Piedmont Hotel
asking urgently to see Du Bois again. He must telephone her ""in the
morning if there is any way by which I can see you. Perhaps you would
come to see me here,"" a suggestion that might have had humiliating, even
tragic, consequences had Du Bois been so unwise as to act upon it. She
would ""gladly go to \[his\] office."" She had ""no special messages"" but
her visit ""would have lost so greatly in its value"" to leave without ""at
least a word with
you.""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-17){#cha-17} Whatever she had
in mind, Breckinridge's enthusiasm for Du Bois and his work was
certainly remarkable in comparison to that of many other distinguished
visitors to Atlanta for its insouciance about southern mores.

With the considerable success of the tenth and eleventh Atlanta
University conferences of 1905 and 1906, Du Bois began to hope that the
period of philanthropic cold-shouldering was really over. At the
eleventh conference, on ""The Health and Physique of the Negro-American,""
Franz Boas, the nation's outstanding anthropologist, had delivered a
paper on the cultural basis of racial behavior. For Du Bois, Boas's
visit had an impact of lasting importance. Du Bois already held a
visceral faith in the historic significance of Africa; Boas supplied
intellectual reinforcement at a critical point. The Columbia professor's
commencement address and their conversations together afforded the
Atlanta professor the most informed revelations then available about the
primordial role of sub-Saharan cultures in promoting the development of
ancient civilizations.[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-18){#cha-18}
The procession through Atlanta University of scholars, social reformers,
religious leaders, university administrators, and public officials
became more impressive each spring. Du Bois was not boasting but merely
stating an acknowledged truth when he told the members of Boston's
Twentieth Century Club that his ""small and poor southern college"" was
the single American institution of learning that was making ""systematic
and conscientious study of the American Negro."" ""The object of this
research is primarily scientific,"" the standard preface to his studies
asserted---advocacy had no place in it---""a careful search for truth
conducted as thoroughly, broadly, and honestly as the material resources
and mental equipment at command will
allow.""[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-19){#cha-19} The ""mental
equipment"" had proven itself fully up to the task. It was the material
resources that Du Bois was starved for and frequently teased by. Nor
could he help saying and writing things---repeatedly and with what
seemed perverse arrogance---that only poisoned further the well of white
beneficence. Organizing and keeping on track the large egos in the
Niagara Movement had taught him something of patience and reciprocity.
Nevertheless, compromise was cousin to cowardice for Du Bois, a moral
holiday that might have to be taken in unusual circumstances but never
for long, and never with pleasure. In fact, he was profoundly averse to
compromise on anything that mattered intellectually or racially. The
more crucial the idea or cause (and Du Bois saw most ideas and causes
that way), the more intransigent he tended to become. He held in polite
contempt those who thought, like Booker Washington, that silence or a
deal was frequently the optimal means to gain an advantage. If he seldom
avoided conflicts others considered eminently avoidable, it was not
usually because of egotism, self-righteousness or folly. His was a
response that all readers of his day familiar by heart with the lines of
Kipling's [If]{.epub-i} should have understood, had not so many
African-Americans been forced to unlearn public courage. Du Bois saw his
approach as being racially manly while all others about him were losing
or trading their principles and dignity. Caustic criticism from a dais
or prose sweeping over adversaries like electric storms were Du Boisian
answers to stereotyped expectations. ""He insists upon making them either
angry or miserable,"" Ovington noted of most white reactions to Du
Bois.[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-20){#cha-20}

It certainly imperiled the Atlanta University Studies to attack the
boosters of vocational education from the same Hampton Institute
platform where the president of the United States had just finished
praising them. On June 30, 1906, in the citadel of ""head and hand""
learning, Du Bois delivered to the institute's summer school the widely
published address, ""The Hampton Idea."" His ""Hampton Idea"" that Saturday
evening stunned into stone silence its audience of scrubbed and prim
black educators and avuncular white dignitaries. With Theodore
Roosevelt's emphatic words of duty and subordination still ringing in
the air, Du Bois inveighed against the ""Great Fear"" that elevated the
duties of Negroes above their rights and commanded, ""above all, \[they\]
watch and ward against the first appearance of arrogance or
self-assertion or consciousness of great power."" He had come frankly to
express dissent as strongly as he was able from the ""educational heresy""
of Hampton. The race was at the crossroads with respect to higher
education, he continued in the utterly still auditorium. Carefully
selected men and women of ""power, of thought, of trained and cultivated
taste"" were indispensable to the forward march. For others, the
practical training of the best quality was equally essential.

But Du Bois was assailing more than Hampton's curriculum of
cabinet-making, plastering, masonry, steam fitting, and the obsolescent
rest. It was the animating spirit of its curriculum that was the
travesty---the ""manner and tone that would make Socrates an idiot and
Jesus Christ a crank."" As black people squirmed and white people
reddened, Du Bois illustrated his meaning by taking on Roosevelt.
Hampton was ""an institution where the President of the United States can
with applause tell young men not to hitch their wagons to a star but to
hitch them to mules."" He knew that the ""great duty before you and me and
our people today is to earn a living,"" but he also believed that
Hampton's understanding of this doctrine was ""so fundamentally false as
to call for a word of warning."" Whatever truth was contained in the
Hampton idea was ineradicably corrupted. When he thought of future
generations of young people nurtured by Hampton graduates, he was truly
alarmed, for they would know only the handicapping of intellectual
ambition, the inculcation of civic timidity, and the rationalization of
second-best as the best possible for them. Hollis Frissell, a majordomo
for the GEB, must have regretted the invitation to Du Bois that summer
as one of the larger mistakes of his principalship. Two world wars would
be fought before Du Bois received another invitation to
Hampton.[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-21){#cha-21} Against such
offenses to the memory of General Armstrong and the work of the
philanthropic trusts, occasional good behavior on his part counted for
very little.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[BETWEEN]{.epub-sc} 1898 and 1904, the U.S. Department of Labor had
promptly published four ground-breaking Du Bois studies of the rural
South. In 1906, the department reissued the 1904 ""Negro Farmer,"" a model
of its kind, with extensive analytical tables derived from the twelfth
census, Du Bois's standing with Willcox and the new commissioner of
labor, Charles P. Neill, was seemingly unassailable at the time, and he
had persuaded the department to fund a sharecropping study of Lowndes
County, Alabama, for the bargain price of \$2,000, \$750 of it going for
his salary. Securing the collaboration of Monroe Work and Richard R.
Wright, among the most scrupulous of younger sociologists, and about a
dozen other investigators, Du Bois drove his team relentlessly
throughout summer and fall of 1906, paying them a daily wage of \$1.50.
He would be caught there in rural Alabama when the Atlanta riot broke,
living among black farmers in the county, supervising from the old
Calhoun missionary school a network of paid investigators, brazening his
ambitious project past clenched-jawed and finally violent white
landowners. Hard-pressed Atlanta University officials agreed, with grave
misgivings, to advance Du Bois several hundred dollars until labor
department accountants got round to reviewing and reimbursing his
expenditures.[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-22){#cha-22}

By early November, shuttling back and forth between Atlanta and the
Calhoun School headquarters, Du Bois reported to Neill that about 25,000
of Lowndes County's 31,000 black farmers had been interviewed and
tabulated even though two of his men ""were shot at and run out of one
corner of the county."" Neill had approved the special release of two
white agents from the Bureau of Labor that October after Du Bois spelled
out the daring scope and depth of his study. He intended to uncover
every mechanism behind landownership and labor control in the county
from 1850 to the present, with the two white agents conducting
""confidential talks"" with white men about politics and sexual morality,
in order to uncover the dynamics behind the statistics. The two white
agents, identified as Foster and Clark, did their work expertly. Records
of justices of the peace and other county officials were combed, every
law pertaining to landholding in Lowndes and throughout the state since
1830 was scrutinized (with labor department lawyers in Washington
assisting). Du Bois was still euphoric in the [Autobiography]{.epub-i}
when he recalled what had been accomplished by the end of 1906. The
schedules were tabulated and chronological maps made of the division of
the land: ""I considered the distribution of labor; the relation of
landlord and tenant; the political organization and the family life and
the distribution of the population. The report was finished by hand with
no copy, and rushed to Washington.""

He must have been somewhat surprised when commissioner Neill informed
him almost immediately that there were problems with the Lowndes County
study---technical problems, he wrote, in a letter that also alluded to
an aborted conference with Du Bois in Washington due to a scheduling
mixup. ""Were your schedules perfect, their tabulations would be
comparatively easy,"" Neill lectured Du Bois, but they were going to need
inspection and editing. Departmental policy strictly required that only
schedules ""that are perfectly plain and capable of but one meaning""
could be accepted. Technical problems and scheduling of meetings in
Washington to thrash them out grew more complicated with each exchange
of letters until it became obvious that publication of the Lowndes
County sharecropping study by the U. S. Department of Labor hung in the
balance. Determined to save his work, Du Bois rechecked, revised, and
disputed the alleged problems with such dogged perseverance that by
mid-March 1907 Neill conceded Du Bois's ""rulings on the greater number
of points."" But not all, and after camping in Washington for three weeks
of additional revisions in April, Du Bois saw Neill disappear behind a
portentously named W. W. Hanger, acting commissioner, who finally
declared on August 30 that ""it would be extremely unwise to make any use
whatever of the material which was gathered in this
form.""[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-23){#cha-23}

Convinced that the integrity of his scholarship was at risk, almost
certainly discounting the looming signals from Washington of
race-relations politics embroiling his study, Du Bois simply refused to
take no for an answer. A cat-and-mouse game with Neill ensued, Du Bois
periodically springing unannounced into the commissioner's office (""I
called on you MondayÂ ... but you were not in the office, nor could I
find you all day""); meantime, the Lowndes data underwent more surgery,
with a desperate Du Bois uncharacteristically apologizing for errors
that the department now deemed incorrigible. A thousand-dollar check for
the balance owed for the study finally arrived in June 1908, but in
early November of that year Du Bois was asking Neill plaintively, ""Can
you give me any idea as to when you are going to be able to take up the
investigation of Lowndes County?"" Finally they told him, as he later
recalled, that his manuscript ""touched on political matters."" He was
convinced now, finally, that the study had been given a runaround just
as the magazine publisher Samuel McClure had done in 1899 when Du Bois
had been paid for an investigative article on social conditions in
Georgia that was never published. Du Bois might entreat, but he was
incapable of groveling. He asked for the return of his controversial
manuscript. ""They told me,"" he exploded incredulously, that ""it had been
destroyed!""[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-24){#cha-24}

The last act in the labor-department tragedy was still five years or
more in the future when Du Bois embarked on another scholarship venture,
in early 1904, whose course would prove as treacherous and its
denouement even more outrageous. Just before leaving for Boston where he
would praise Atlanta University before the prestigious Twentieth Century
Club, there was jolting news. Since the previous November, he had been
turning over in his mind the intriguing biography he was to write of
Frederick Douglass for the Philadelphia firm of George W. Jacobs &
Company. He was not an exponent of what might be called Douglass's
radical assimilationism, yet Du Bois still greatly admired the leader
whose statesmanship he had paid tribute to in an 1895 memorial service
at Wilberforce. Now came a letter from Jacobs & Company editor Ellis
Paxson Oberholtzer on January 25, 1904, begging Du Bois to choose
another subject for the [American Crisis]{.epub-i} series. Oberholtzer
explained that his earlier invitation to Booker Washington had gone
unanswered, and he had therefore felt free to approach Du Bois. But now,
out of the blue, Washington's acceptance had just arrived. Oberholtzer's
delicate suggestion to the Wizard to consider another subject from a
later period (""one that calls for less historical learning"") had been
rebuffed. ""Can you suggest any other name?"" the genuinely embarrassed
editor (on the brink of sending the contract) asked Du
Bois.[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-25){#cha-25}

Whether by design or chance, Du Bois's nemesis denied the world a
provocative biography by a major twentieth-century African-American of
the nineteenth century's major African-American. But what is equally
regrettable, Du Bois was to be denied his second choice. What Du Bois
would have said about Nat Turner, the slave whose 1831 insurrection in
Virginia rocked the South, might have been something of an event in
historiography as well as biography. Du Bois enthusiastically described
to Oberholtzer the flesh-and-blood paradigm he proposed to make of Nat
Turner: ""Around him would center the slave trade, foreign and internal.""
He proposed to trace slave insurrections from Toussaint L'Ouverture to
John Brown, recapturing the beginnings of abolitionism, the activities
of free Negroes in the North, the antebellum plantation economy, ""which
was changing critically in the thirties, and the general subjective
Negro point of view of the system of slavery."" As he promised
Oberholtzer, ""no single man before or since 1850 had a greater influence
on Southern life and feeling than Nat Turner."" Clearly Du Bois intended
to focus for a time the attention of intelligent white readers and
historians on much that was unfamiliar and on much that he would
reinterpret in an unfamiliar mode. This may have been a great deal more
than the editor bargained for. He was ""a little ignorant about the life
of Nat Turner,"" Oberholtzer replied. He deliberated awhile, consulted
the arbitral historian John McMaster, and, regretting that no one known
to him knew of Turner and his significance, counterproposed a biography
of John Brown.[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-26){#cha-26}

It would take Du Bois five years filled with teaching, lecture tours,
scholarly writings and popular essays, editing two periodicals, and the
captaincy of the Niagara Movement to finish [John Brown.]{.epub-i} He
intended the research to be thorough, though not exhaustive; he
contacted one of Brown's last surviving contemporaries and pressed
Freeman Murray's brother, Daniel Alexander, special assistant at the
Library of Congress (whose contribution to the Negro pavilion at the
1900 Paris Exposition had been crucial), for materials. Along the way,
he underwent a tonsillectomy, and somewhat later suffered the ""loss of
nearly a monthÂ ... of working time,"" as he wrote Oberholtzer in October
1908, due to Yolande's appendectomy. There was also an exchange of
letters with Oswald Villard, at work on a Brown biography of his own,
the significance of which would become clear only after George W. Jacobs
& Company released Du Bois's in the fall of 1909. Replying to Villard's
now-lost inquiry about the biography, Du Bois stressed frankly that he
was writing an interpretation and was ""not trying to go very largely to
the sources."" Most of the source material was contained in the work of
Franklin B. Sanborn and one or two others, Du Bois thought, but he
supposed that Villard already knew this. In any case, Du Bois said he'd
be ""very glad"" to assist Villard further if he could. About mid-December
1908, the complete manuscript for the book went off to the
publisher.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-27){#cha-27}

Like the novel Du Bois was writing whenever he could steal time, [John
Brown]{.epub-i} was an uneven product. Because he tried to accomplish so
much during these Atlanta years, the quality of some things was bound to
be flawed. Portions of the [John Brown]{.epub-i} biography justified its
author's belief that it was ""one of the best books that \[he\] ever
wrote,"" but many others belie the judgment. Quotations run on for
pages---typical of biographies of the period, but still excessive.
Chapter 7, ""The Swamp of the Swan,"" recapitulates events from chapter 6
(""The Call of Kansas""), passing them under a magnifying glass rather
than enhancing what has already been said about John Brown's national
debut with a broadsword at Osawatomie; and by page 175 the chapter's
padding began to show badly. Chapter 9, ""The Black Phalanx,"" covered the
history of Afro-America from 1830 to 1840 admirably, showcasing the
author's interpretive prowess and command of detail in a narrative as
engrossing as it was decoupled from the protagonist. Du Bois poured into
it the unknown history of African-American protest before the Civil War,
the appearance of black journalism beginning in the 1820s, the Negro
Convention Movement in the 1830s, and the appeal of emigrationism in the
1850s. At the very end of this chapter, which reads like a composite of
brilliant papers prepared for historical conferences, John Brown's
reappearance seemed almost a clumsy tack-on, saying both too much and
too little: ""Of all this development,"" Du Bois wrote, coming back to his
protagonist, this saint of gore ""knew far more than most white men and
it was based on this great knowledge that his great faith was
based.""[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-28){#cha-28}

Du Bois draped his Old Testament hero in Old Testament prose, an
excellent technique at its best, as when the reader meets the ""belated
Covenanter"" for the first time: ""John Brown was a stalwart, rough-hewn
man, mightily yet tenderly carven. To his making went the stern justice
of a Cromwellian 'Ironside,' the freedom-loving fire of a Welsh Celt,
and the thrift of a Dutch housewife."" The image throughout of rough-hewn
granite glowing from a fire at its core was surely on the mark, even if
Du Bois's prose occasionally turned as purple as the Harper's Ferry
elocution of Reverdy Ransom, by which it was almost certainly colored.
Du Bois suspected that his book contained mistakes, and he was certainly
too much the trained scholar---and too much the representative of the
race, besides---to be unconcerned. But, as he told Villard, his primary
concern was not with facts but interpretation. In this respect, [John
Brown]{.epub-i} was a milestone, revealing Du Bois's increasing
willingness to commingle advocacy with scholarship, to envelop history
and social science in judgment and prophecy. For all the well-phrased
chronicling of [John Brown,]{.epub-i} the biography was much more an
allegory than a critical study. He endeavored passionately to convey the
meaning of the life of the wrathful, violent abolitionist to the
twentieth century. ""Has John Brown no message---no legacy, then?"" the
author asked rhetorically in the closing pages. ""He has and it is this
great word: the cost of liberty is less than the price of repression.""
Du Bois had said as much in [The Suppression of the African Slave
Trade,]{.epub-i} but there the strictures had been far more restrained
by scholarship, whereas in [John Brown]{.epub-i} the relationship was
reversed. ""The price of repressing the world's darker races,"" he
continued, ""is shown in a moral retrogression and an economic waste
unparalleled since the age of the African
slave-trade.""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-29){#cha-29}

Du Bois's handling of revolutionary violence, the paramount question of
force and bloodshed in order to ""bring peace and good will,"" reflected
an Edwardian aversion to the justification of means by ends. Du Bois
cast John Brown's homicidal swath through Kansas and bloody apotheosis
at Harper's Ferry, therefore, as exceptional deeds in the service of
truths that none could challenge---the morality of the ""Hebrew
religion,"" the principles of the French Revolution, the sanguinary
watering of the Jeffersonian tree of liberty. Brown's violence
prefigured the terrible yet purifying national fratricide. It was an
avenging odyssey, to be celebrated in song and sanctified by the blood
of millions of men marching to Manassas and the Wilderness. When the
second edition of [John Brown]{.epub-i} appeared in 1962, Du Bois's new
preface and his insertion of new textual matter would reflect the
Marxism of his later years---especially his rethinking of revolutionary
violence---but his John Brown of 1909, like the Lord God Jehovah, was a
lightning flash of Good striking Evil rather than a violent
revolutionary. ""Revolution is not a test of capacity,"" Du Bois wrote
solemnly in 1909; ""it is always a loss and a lowering of ideals.""
Although a discussion of how and why Du Bois's views underwent profound
change in the second edition belong elsewhere, mention must be made here
of these lines he would insert later: ""But if it is a true revolution,""
he would write, ""it repays all the losses and results in the uplift of
the human race.""[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-30){#cha-30}

Sales were disappointing. Jacobs & Company was not especially aggressive
in marketing the biography, and reviews were less glowing than those for
[The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} or [The Souls of Black Folk.]{.epub-i}
Within a few months of Du Bois's [John Brown,]{.epub-i} Oswald Villard's
huge, long-awaited, and definitive [John Brown: A Biography]{.epub-i}
appeared. Professor William E. Dodd of the University of Chicago, a
distinguished historian and biographer and future ambassador to Germany,
sternly corrected the shortcomings of the first [John Brown]{.epub-i} in
the [American Historical Review,]{.epub-i} regretting its
""hero-worship,"" ""sensational"" prose, and ""somewhat inaccurate story.""
Dodd found ""much that commends the book,"" but he was unenthusiastic
about Du Bois's rendering of the life as ""simply the work of God in
human hands, as the first battle of the righteous North against the
wicked South."" Two major assertions in [John Brown,]{.epub-i} which
struck Dodd as fanciful, came to be recognized as accurate when American
historiography caught up with Du Bois: the role of fugitive slaves in
the two Seminole Wars and the connection between Haiti's Toussaint
L'Ouverture and the Louisiana Purchase. The appreciation of the
biography in the [Independent]{.epub-i} was all that its author could
have wished, a review that took the book on Du Bois's own terms. The
facts were not new, it said, but ""the viewpoint---that of a champion of
the negro race---is notable, and the argument made for justice to that
race is forcible and
moving.""[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-31){#cha-31}

The savaging of the biography in [The Nation]{.epub-i} must have damaged
its sales. And there is no question about the damage it did to Du Bois's
ego and to the collaboration just then beginning between himself and
Villard in connection with what would shortly emerge as the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The long, unsigned
[Nation]{.epub-i} review ran on October 28, 1909 (republished in the New
York [Post]{.epub-i} that same week), rendering Du Bois apoplectic. It
was instantly obvious that Villard, owner of [The Nation]{.epub-i} and
the [Post]{.epub-i} and author of the forthcoming Brown biography, had
written it. With admirable self-restraint, Du Bois conceded a number of
errors in his letter to the editor of [The Nation:]{.epub-i} Brown's
Mayflower descent; the slave birth of one of Brown's men and the
Canadian citizenship of another; an incorrect middle name for another;
mistaken attribution of Negro blood to yet another; an inaccurate date
for Brown's sojourn in Iowa. (The 1973 Aptheker edition of [John
Brown]{.epub-i} would discern more ""slips on dates"" that would have
pleased Villard.) As for the question of sources raised in the
[Nation]{.epub-i} review, Du Bois asserted that he remained satisfied
with his choice of Sanborn, Hinton, Redpath, Anderson, and several other
contemporaries of Brown. Finally, it struck him as puzzling that, beyond
the lambasting of factual errors, nothing was said about the point of
view of his biography, which Du Bois had emphatically identified in his
preface as the main theme---""the little known but vastly important inner
development of the Negro American"" as seen through Brown's
career.[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-32){#cha-32}

Errors conceded and disagreements noted, Du Bois concluded that
""courtesy calls for the insertion of the enclosed letter in your
columns."" Not only did Paul Elmer Moore, [The Nation]{.epub-i}'s editor,
refuse to publish the letter, he gave Du Bois a tutorial in
historiography, condescendingly advising him that ""it would be of no
service to you to print your reply."" The problem, Moore explained
(undoubtedly prompted by Villard), was that Du Bois failed to understand
""what is really source material and what is not."" Large collections of
original materials had become available since Hinton, Redpath, and
Sanborn, none of which had been used for his [John Brown.]{.epub-i} The
editor struck a final blow for good measure, writing that ""the reviewer
could have said more about your factual inaccuracies."" Temples
throbbing, Du Bois shot back, aiming to smoke out the invisible Villard.
He and the rich, imperious publisher had been three years apart at
Harvard, both of them excelling in their graduate work under Hart. The
Atlanta professor might not be a ""judge of original historical
material,"" but he ""certainly should not think of seating \[him\]self at
the feet of Mr. Villard for instruction either in History or English.""
Books have mistakes in them, ""but savagely to emphasize these so as to
give an impression of total falsity is a contemptible thing to do."" He
would not be patronized. He demanded the courtesy that gentlemen extend
to one another. ""WhetherÂ ... or not \[it\] will 'help' me or not is my
business and the publics and not yours,"" Du Bois
roared.[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-33){#cha-33} And besides,
the author of the contemptible review was also the author of a rival
biography.

Moore closed the debate on a pained note of superiority, and an amazed
letter from Villard followed, professing ""deep interest"" in Du Bois and
his ""usefulness in the community,"" as well as the merits of [The Souls
of Black Folk.]{.epub-i} Surely his desire to promote Du Bois to an
important position with the ""new National Negro Board"" certified
goodwill, Villard averred. Really, he had been done an injustice. As for
the fate of his own biography, ""I confess myself to be quite
indifferent,"" Villard sniffed. In time, Du Bois and Villard would
develop a grudging mutual respect, but for Du Bois such respect would be
driven by labor in a common cause and the discipline of intellect.
Rancor would always exist between them just below the surface. ""To a
white philanthropist like Villard,"" Du Bois said long afterward, ""a
Negro was quite naturally expected to be humble and thankful or
certainly not assertive and aggressive."" Finally, if Villard's
critically acclaimed and brisk-selling [John Brown]{.epub-i} seemed
unmarred by error, it, too, was stitched together with lengthy
quotations and full to the brim with moralizing. It contained no direct
reference to Du Bois's book, but there was a skewering comment in the
preface about erroneous comparisons of Brown to ""Hebrew prophets or to a
Cromwellian
Roundhead.""[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-34){#cha-34} Like Du
Bois's Brown, Villard's was the high-minded agent of destiny. Slavery
""was bound to be overthrown because, in the long run, truth and
righteousness prevail."" Villard took greater pains than Du Bois,
however, to wrap John Brown in the mantle of grandfather William Lloyd
Garrison's tradition of nonviolence. It was Brown's ""wonderful readiness
to die with joy and in peace,"" not the example of his righteous
wrath---Brown on the scaffold, not Brown at Harper's Ferry---that was
transcendent and enduring. Du Bois would never know of a letter in which
Hart not only chided Villard for his ""rather severe"" review of Du Bois's
biography but recalled that ""not so many years agoÂ ... you envisaged the
whole controversy very much as Du Bois does
now.""[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-35){#cha-35}

The origin and reception of his John Brown biography was typical of the
fate of much of his output during the Atlanta years. Over and again he
would have to recast ambitious plans to fit frail budgets, take the
leavings of research projects he should have been asked to design or
direct, and persevere against heartbreaking odds in order to complete
seminal work to which major white foundations, universities, or learned
journals gave only cursory notice, when they noticed at all, or, like
the Department of Labor and Villard, tasked his efforts from ulterior
motives. The silences and dismissals greeting his pleas for research
funds must have etched that ""cruel look"" Ovington saw on Du Bois's
sensitive face. Willcox had sought his expertise in preparing the
American Economic Association paper, but it never occurred to Willcox to
plead Du Bois's case to the Carnegie Institution when a 1902 ""race
mixture"" investigation was being
proposed.[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-36){#cha-36} The year
following publication of [The Souls of Black Folk,]{.epub-i} Edgar
Gardner Murphy's book of eight essays, [The Present South,]{.epub-i}
arguing that the African-American masses were falling away from
civilization, was lauded as the ultimate wisdom in [The Outlook, The New
York Times,]{.epub-i} and the New York [Tribune.]{.epub-i} Secretary of
State John Hay wrote the neurasthenic Murphy that he had ""read nothing
referring to the vital question it discusses at all comparable with your
book in vigor, fairness, and lucidity."" Baldwin and the venerable Carl
Schurz agreed, and George F. Peabody bought a thousand copies of [The
Present South]{.epub-i} for free
distribution.[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-37){#cha-37}

The same year in which he delivered the ""Hampton Idea"" speech, Du Bois
was strikingly portrayed in [The Future in America,]{.epub-i} a widely
discussed book by H. G. Wells, the latest European visitor in the
tradition of Tocqueville and Lord Bryce. After a leisurely luncheon in
Boston with Booker Washington, Wells had decided that the slow-talking
Tuskegee principal possessed the ""scope and range of a statesman,"" while
Du Bois (""perhaps as English as you or I"") was said to betray the
anguish of the cultured mulatto. The author of [The Souls of Black
Folk]{.epub-i} concealed ""his passionate resentment all too thinly,""
Wells believed. ""He batters himself into rhetoric against these walls.
He will not repudiate the clear right of the black man to every
educational facility, to equal citizenship, or equal
respect.""[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-38){#cha-38} Men like
Robert Ogden and Teddy Roosevelt had no need of a book by a roving
Englishman to recognize Du Bois for what he was---a dangerous racial
malcontent. And although he never actually dissembled, there were a few
occasions when Du Bois decided it was expedient to reign in his
acidulous temper and try to court influential white people. At Bar
Harbor in July 1905, he appears to have done his courtly best to be
especially winsome. Edward T. Ware, Atlanta University's friendly new
president and a white northerner, ribbed him about Mrs. Schieffelin's
eager anticipation of Du Bois's morning lecture to the ladies' swimming
club. ""You see, I told her you were a fine swimmer and looked
particularly well in tights."" Ware spoofed on to suggest that Du Bois
give his lecture in the swimming pool ""illustrating \[it\] by various
dives.""[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-39){#cha-39} A graceful
swimmer, Du Bois still could not help making waves. In almost every
instance, the experiment in conciliation fizzled or soured, and merely
reinforced his profound pessimism concerning the goodwill of most
whites.

There was one goodwill experiment in which he invested much patience. In
his dealings with the important white journalist Ray Stannard Baker, he
practiced consummate diplomacy, repeatedly stifling the urge to deliver
a rebuke to the uninformed midwesterner about the race problem. Baker
came to Atlanta at the beginning of 1907 on a circuit to major cities in
order to write a series of magazine pieces on race in America. These
pieces would be published the next year as the influential book
[Following the Color Line]{.epub-i} (a title almost certainly suggested
by Du Bois). Two years younger than Du Bois, Baker was quick, congenial,
and, Du Bois thought, malleable, a widely known investigative reporter
whose articles in the large-circulation [American Magazine]{.epub-i}
about the Atlanta riot could be invaluable. From Baker's first note sent
from the Piedmont Hotel, it was obvious to Du Bois that Baker knew
nothing about African-Americans, North or South. Ovington, who knew him
well and tried to educate him for the southern trip, agreed with a
friend's estimate that Baker was ""a young person whose mother didn't
know he was out.""[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-40){#cha-40} Du
Bois responded with unusual cordiality to Baker's proposal for a
give-and-take about southern race relations in the study of Reverend C.
B. Wilmer, the city's leading white moderate. Du Bois and Wilmer might
debate such subjects, Baker suggested, as ""what does the white man mean
when he speaks of justice and what does the Negro mean?"" Baker thought
the three-hour colloquium with Wilmer and Du Bois went so well that he
asked their permission to rework it for publication in [American
Magazine.]{.epub-i}[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-41){#cha-41}

Meanwhile, he put himself to school at Du Bois's lectern, reading a few
recommended books, asking questions, submitting copy for criticism. Du
Bois purred that, ""on the whole,"" he liked Baker's first article on the
riot. In that article, Baker's description of Brownsville, the
neighborhood devastated by white vigilantes, gave the lie to sensational
newspaper accounts written in the heat of the riot. Baker found ""a large
settlement of negroes practically every one of whom owned his own home,
some of the houses being as attractive without and as well furnished
within as the ordinary homes of middle class white people."" The
[American Magazine]{.epub-i} piece on Atlanta had drama and tragedy,
portraying both races as victims of dark, irrational forces. ""Of course
I think that you exaggerate somewhat the influence of crime upon the
race problem,"" Du Bois had added as an instructive afterthought. Back in
New York, Baker was anxious to have Du Bois ""look over the endorsed
proof of my next article."" Meanwhile, editing of the Wilmer-Du Bois
dialogue was coming along, he mentioned. This time, though, the tutor
had sharper reservations: Baker was letting hysteria about rape,
bestiality, and black criminality get out of hand. ""The reasons for
white people leaving the Black Belt are social and economic and not
criminal,"" Du Bois wrote. If there was widespread fear of blacks by
whites, ""it is the fear the oppressor has of the oppressed."" But Baker
had had all the lessons he needed; a few ""modificationsÂ ... somewhat
along the lines"" of Du Bois's suggestions, he noted, and the articles on
the South were finished. He advised Du Bois that he had found that white
people in the South ""really felt"" afraid---""the fear of Negro crime is
indeed a very potent influence down there, especially among the women.""
Baker mentioned only in passing the editorial comments arriving from
Tuskegee. Patient to the end, Du Bois hoped that at least he had shown
how wrong Baker had been to think that it was possible for
African-Americans to have economic and spiritual freedom without
""defense of the
ballot.""[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-42){#cha-42} As the
journalist was about to head north to study the race problem, Du Bois
offered to supply introductions to prominent leaders there.

The articles Du Bois offered to write for [American Magazine]{.epub-i}
were rejected, nor did the Wilmer--Du Bois dialogue ever appear in its
pages. As his access to Baker was indirect, buffered by editorial
assistants, Du Bois could at least console himself that [Following the
Color Line]{.epub-i} was better than it would have been had he not done
his best to educate Baker. He had gotten the inexperienced author to
endorse the ""barest sort of justice for Black Men."" Baker, too, had
walked a tightrope between what Du Bois taught him and what he felt it
would have been impolitic, if not fatal to his book's success, to write.
Ovington's experience with magazine publishers had served as a warning
to him.[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-43){#cha-43} As if the
effort of gathering facts about the lives of black people in America had
wearied him, Baker concluded his book with what sounded like a
sigh---the less said about the problem of the color line the better, he
advised. White America generally preferred to believe that
African-Americans were either backward as a group---and therefore beyond
ready remediation---or, like the examples in Booker Washington's
speeches, striding up from slavery, and therefore in little need of
political and legal redress. Not even a perceptive progressive like
Baker was willing to run the risks to his career that forceful drawing
out of the civil rights implications in [Following the Color
Line]{.epub-i} would surely have entailed.

For Du Bois, the moral grounding of intellectual and civic activity was
derived from the social and political conditions of life behind the
veil. All else was persiflage, evasion, hypocrisy, and conspiracy.
Teamed together with the Wizard as late as 1907 in a jointly authored
book about southern conditions, the difference between his and
Washington's racial ideology, as well as the texture of expression, was
never more striking. [The Negro in the South: His Economic Progress in
Relation to His Moral and Religious Development]{.epub-i} received wide
and favorable comment but left suspicions about Du Bois unchanged.
Increasingly, he made much of the genteel white public uncomfortable.
Although their texts were bound together between the same covers, the
two leaders seemed in accord on nothing more than the book's title.
Washington delivered vintage homilies such as that there was no ""human
law that can prevail against"" a race living high ideals, nor any that
could affect ""the Negro in relation to his singing, his peace, and his
self-control."" Du Bois, as usual, affirmed truths unpopular in the white
South: disfranchisement was supposed to lead to ""more careful attention
to the Negro's moral and economic advancement. It has on the contrary
stripped them \[sic\] naked to their
enemies.""[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-44){#cha-44}

By 1907, Du Bois's incorrigible candor was having a lethal impact on
Atlanta University. The new young president, Edmund Ware, Yale-educated
son of founding president Asa Ware, felt the chill wind from 61 Broadway
blowing across his hilltop campus within weeks after assuming office. Du
Bois liked Ware and applauded his enthusiasm but seems to have thought
him somewhat high-strung. Ware's increasingly troubled demeanor was
certainly understandable, however. Requesting fifteen thousand dollars
over a three-year term in order to build a slender endowment in late
1907, the young president was informed by Wallace Buttrick that the GEB
was ""perplexed by the fact that there are so many colleges for colored
people in the one city of Atlanta."" Ware wrote back immediately that he
was afraid Atlanta University was in disfavor with the omnipotent
philanthropy. The silence greeting his letter caused him to beg Buttrick
in early February 1908 to write him ""very frankly on the subject and
tell me in what respects we incur their disapproval."" There was no
disapproval, Buttrick replied. He hoped an opportunity would come
someday ""to help uphold your hands in the noble work you are doing with
the colored people.""[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-45){#cha-45}
President Ware would still be waiting for Buttrick's opportunity three
years later.

While the new president fretted, the worn-down former president
continued his game quest for dollars for the school. At the beginning of
May 1907, Horace Bumstead's New England reserve gave way momentarily as
he excitedly wrote Du Bois a run-on letter about a chance Manhattan
encounter with Robert W. De Forest of the new Russell Sage Foundation.
He felt that there was a strong possibility of a five-thousand-dollar
annual appropriation for the conference studies. De Forest told Bumstead
that ""he knew all about Atlanta University, and its work commanded his
respect, and he seemed much interested in all I told him about the
Conference and looked over with care the leaflet that I handed him which
you wrote several years ago."" Du Bois prepared a lengthy rÃ©sumÃ© of the
conference studies along with an itemized budget projection, which he
sent off by return mail to Bumstead for delivery to the Russell Sage
Foundation. It would probably take a miracle to pry a few thousand
dollars out of Russell Sage, he predicted in a note to William James,
thanking his favorite professor for encouraging words about the last
conference study. ""I wish we could do better. However, it is something
to be doing
something.""[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-46){#cha-46} There is
no record of either Du Bois or Bumstead ever receiving a reply from the
philanthropy.

The year before Bumstead's talk with De Forest, Du Bois had himself
approached Andrew Carnegie, in late May 1906, expressing the hope that
the steel colossus would ""remember \[him\] as being presented to you and
Mr. Carl Schurz at Carnegie Hall some years ago."" Appreciating that
Carnegie must be ""overwhelmed with communications of this sort,"" Du Bois
drafted a letter of model conciseness that told Carnegie everything he
needed to know in order to invite further
inquiry.[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-47){#cha-47} No record of
a reply from Carnegie exists, but shortly after his direct appeal to
Tuskegee's principal benefactor, Du Bois thought he saw another
opportunity to win Carnegie funds. In response to remarks quoted in [The
Independent]{.epub-i} by its president, Du Bois sent the vastly rich
Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C., an unsolicited research
proposal comprehending virtually all the possible future agendas for the
study of Africans in the Americas and of American race relations. Du
Bois proposed to accomplish a catholic research enterprise at Atlanta
University for the asking price of \$7,500 annually (\$2,000 at a
minimum). He would build on historical studies of Africa, the Atlantic
slave trade, of institutions and customs of U.S. slavery, education,
economics, and politics after manumission; move on to comparative
studies of slavery in the western hemisphere, peoples in Africa, manners
and mores broadly; then to anthropological and ethnographic studies of
racial types, racial intermixtures, and ethnic and cultural variations
on the African continent; ending with sociological studies intended to
consolidate, classify, and derive ""scientific"" generalizations. Fearing
that the gentlemen at the Carnegie Institution would blunder, Du Bois
warned them, ""If we miss this opportunity either by willful neglect or
by unsystematic and slip-shod work, we not only will fail to furnish
philanthropists with a body of truth on which they can depend in present
and future work, but we shall hurt the cause of scientific research in
all lines and decrease human knowledge in a universe of which we know
all too little.""[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-48){#cha-48}

This time, Du Bois got an oblique and demeaning reply. He was still
waiting to hear from Carnegie or his philanthropy when he opened a
letter from Mississippi planter and amateur sociologist Alfred Holt
Stone, the first of several from Stone during June 1906. The
Mississippian, who controlled the lives of hundreds of black tenants on
Dunleith, his extensive Delta plantation, was brilliant, charming,
gregarious, and intellectually duplicitous. The contents of his letters
underscored, as little else could have, the absurdity of Du Bois's
position in the world of mainstream scholarship. Here was Stone, the
gentleman amateur and standard bearer of the South's planter oligarchy,
writing to Du Bois in full confidence that his own petition to do the
sort of work Du Bois himself had proposed time and again would be
approved by the Carnegie Institution. Stone was proposing a broad study
of the American race problem, one that he promised would be ""frank,
without being offensive to either
race.""[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-49){#cha-49} He desired Du
Bois's counsel, even collaboration.

The author of [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} and eleven
interdisciplinary monographs on Afro-America marveled ""that to
\[Stone's\] direction, Mr. Carnegie and others entrusted a fund for
certain studies among Negroes."" Stone's lectures in the North on the
problematic future of African-Americans (he expected them to die out)
were well known, as well as his almost catastrophic experiment in
substituting southern Italians for black sharecroppers on his sprawling
plantation. The Italian surrogates had proven ""too handy with the
knife,"" Du Bois chuckled. ""Why they selected him and neglected an
established center like Atlanta University,"" Du Bois tongue-in-cheekedly
wrote thirty-odd years later, ""I cannot imagine."" He could have
speculated that the Carnegie Institution's motives reflected the strong
contemporary endorsement of the trend to wildly speculative or dismally
""scientific"" books on the African-American by self-taught Anglo-Saxon
experts such as Viscount James Bryce, Maurice Evans, Robert W. Shufeldt,
Harry Johnston, and, above all, Prudential Life Insurance Company chief
physician Frederick Hoffman, whose 1896 [Race Traits and Tendencies of
the American Negro]{.epub-i} was the source book on the subject. Within
a short time, another of Du Bois's attempts to secure research funds
from the Carnegie Institution would be politely turned down by the
august John Franklin Jameson, a founder of the American Historical
Association and future manuscripts chief at the Library of Congress. In
January 1907, Jameson replied that he had read ""with pleasure"" [The
Suppression of the African Slave Trade,]{.epub-i} but regretted that
there was no ""opportunity for doing the sort of work you mention in this
department of the Carnegie
Institution.""[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-50){#cha-50}

By the time Jameson replied, Du Bois had negotiated his collaboration
with Stone. The twelfth Atlanta conference plans called for the study of
the African-American in politics, a potentially explosive subject; but
prospects for funding were so dismal that the university's agonizing
trustees were considering an adjournment. Seeing a way to funds, Du Bois
offered to help Stone by substituting a study of African-American
economic conditions if the Carnegie Institution would underwrite the
topic as the twelfth conference study. Writing from Dunleith plantation
on January 1, 1907, Stone thought Du Bois's request for a thousand
dollars ""entirely justified by the work we have in view."" On the
nineteenth, Du Bois sent Stone an understanding that the Carnegie
Institution would pay Atlanta University one thousand dollars in four
payments. The twelfth Atlanta Study, ""Economic Cooperation among Negro
Americans,"" a wide-ranging historical overview and inventory of
contemporary commercial and business activity, was the
result.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-51){#cha-51} But before the
second Carnegie installment reached him, Du Bois discovered that he had
been cynically used by Stone as part of a maneuver that proved too
injurious to African-Americans even for Booker Washington. The Wizard
had also been deceived by the planter's aristocratic affableness, until
he read the articles soon to be gathered in book form as the widely read
[Studies in the American Race Problem]{.epub-i} (1908).

White blood alone made black intelligence possible, Stone argued. Were
it not for stern and steady Caucasian controls, Negro atavism and
savagery would run amok. When the Wizard advised the Carnegie
Institution that Stone was an inappropriate recipient of funds to
investigate race relations, however, he was told that no less an
authority than Du Bois had certified Stone's fitness. At almost that
same moment, a furious Du Bois was writing Stone to protest the
deviousness behind his articles. In personal conversation and letters,
Stone was ""perfectly fair,"" Du Bois conceded. But in Stone's writings,
he never had ""a good word for the Negro, you never give any excuses for
his condition, you simply attack him---not, to be sure, as some people
attack him, but, nevertheless, in a way which really does a great deal
more harm."" Unfazed, the planter thanked Du Bois for his ""frank
criticism"" which was ""something very difficult to secure."" Six weeks
later Stone sent him a testimonial about the great value of the Atlanta
University Studies on Carnegie Institution
stationery.[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-52){#cha-52} He and
Stone would tangle again soon, and rather famously, but in the meantime
Du Bois, stoic and indefatigable, turned his energies to his Lowndes
County study, the twelfth conference, [John Brown,]{.epub-i} articles,
speaking engagements, and a host of other projects.

At Bumstead's urging, Du Bois had spent January and February of 1907
speaking to northern audiences about Atlanta University. It was not the
sort of work Du Bois enjoyed, although he seems to have done it better
than he cared to admit. But since it was seldom his practice to speak
extemporaneously in the fashion of a Ransom or a Wright, the obligation
to compose different speeches---suited to the oak-and-leather settings
of exclusive white men's clubs, the charged atmosphere of many black
churches, and of public meeting halls filled with well-meaning white
people---taxed his energies considerably. The itinerary assigned to Du
Bois by the retired president had kept him in motion with a Carnegie
Hall speech arranged by Felix Adler's Society for Ethical Culture (""very
insistent that you should not attack Booker Washington""), another at the
Episcopal Church of the Ascension, and a string of others in the New
York area. In a note from Bumstead during this period he regretted not
having known sooner ""of your desire not to speak more than once on
Sunday. I would have spared
you.""[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-53){#cha-53}

Du Bois rarely spared himself, though. Less than a week later, he was in
Illinois to deliver ""Sociology and Industry in Southern Education""
before the Social Study Clubs of the University of Chicago, featuring a
lucid blend of common sense and history. ""It seems to most southerners,
white and black,"" he told the audience, ""as though the situation in
which they find themselves today is absolutely unique, that never before
had two diverse races ever met in the world's history."" Without the
education that would give to race relations a comparative
perspective---a broad knowledge of culture contacts in other places and
times---the South's people were doomed to a brutal and futile racial
impasse, he warned. The day before the lecture at the university, he
spoke on Abraham Lincoln to a capacity Hull House audience assembled by
Jane Addams. It would be surprising if Ida Wells-Barnett and her
husband, Ferdinand, editor of the strongly anti-Tuskegee newspaper [The
Conservator,]{.epub-i} had not come to hear Du Bois. The Barnetts had
risked a great deal in defending [The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i}
among white and black Chicagoans when it first
appeared.[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-54){#cha-54} In any case,
Du Bois had learned by then to expect the aggressive Ida Wells-Barnett
to volunteer all the advice she could. These speeches, along with the
vintage Du Bois essay ""The Value of Agitation,"" were printed in full in
Max Barber's doughty [Voice of the Negro,]{.epub-i} alive in Chicago but
not well.[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-55){#cha-55}

Du Bois's pen might have yielded more during this period; but since the
appearance in [Collier's]{.epub-i} of his prophecy that Japans 1904
defeat of czarist Russia signified the beginning of the end of ""white
supremacy,"" he had been unsuccessful in placing pieces in the major
monthlies. As he warned an English friend who hoped to place an article
or two of his, it was ""very difficult to get anything favorable to the
Negro into many of the American journals just now."" [Collier's]{.epub-i}
was unreceptive to his idea of a series to be called ""Along the Color
Line,"" and Bliss Perry at the [Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i} returned an
entry as regrettably ""too technical and difficult for the average
magazine reader to comprehend easily."" Walter Hines Page of Doubleday
(blistered by Du Bois for publishing Thomas Dixon's racist novels)
declined the honor of a collection of essays titled ""Sociology of the
Negro American."" Du Bois also gathered information about atrocities
committed by American forces in the Philippines from the
Anti-Imperialist League, apparently intending to write a critical piece
on America's new membership in the club of
empire.[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-56){#cha-56}

Unexpectedly, Doubleday Page & Company invited him to do a book of his
choosing in March 1907. Du Bois leapt at the suggestion, requesting an
advance to do a large study of the West Indies and Africa. That very
week he had written the well-traveled Milholland about ""an English lady
who visited this institution"" and offered to underwrite a four-week
vacation abroad. Frances Elizabeth Hoggan of London's New Hospital for
Women was one of Great Britain's leading physicians, coauthor (with her
physician husband) of numerous medical-journal articles, and she was
soon to sail to South Africa, at age sixty-five, to study health
conditions there. Hoggan had been as impressed by Du Bois as Mary
Ovington and Sophonisba Breckinridge. ""You seemed a little uncertain
about your trip to England,"" she wrote sympathetically, ""invigorating
and refreshing as I am sure you felt it would be."" She not only insisted
that he get away, Hoggan sent Du Bois fifty pounds in late March 1907
with a promise that another fifty would be deposited to a London account
for his use. He wanted the trip to England ""more than I can say,"" Du
Bois replied. ""A check on London would be quite satisfactory."" Doubleday
Page & Company declined Du Bois's ambitious book idea, but Milholland
replied quickly with a Lake District itinerary and a list of important
persons to meet. William James wrote that he was sending Henry (""who
lives at Rye, two hours from London on the coast"") a note in case Du
Bois found time to pay a
call.[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-57){#cha-57}

Du Bois's four-week reprieve from scholarship and civil rights came
between unhappy revisions in June of the Lowndes County tabulations and
the well-attended Boston Niagara meeting at the end of August. His ship
on the Allen Line weighed anchor from Montreal on June 20. Ten leisurely
days later, he cycled out of Glasgow toward a week's tour of the Lake
District. The bicycle, which he also took to France, seems to have been
of an excellent make, and Du Bois expended considerable correspondence
after returning to the States trying to undo a curious mixup in which
the bicycle of a Miss Moreland of Saskatchewan, Canada, was mistakenly
shipped instead of his from
England.[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-58){#cha-58} There was
much taking of tea with distinguished Britons, although a good number of
those on Milholland's list were on vacation themselves. Too far from
London to propose ""any brief or convenient form of visit,"" Henry James
hoped he might still find Du Bois at his hotel when he reached the
capital after August 22. As James feared, a meeting at which two of the
most perceptive observers of American society might have compared notes
never took place.[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-59){#cha-59} Had
they survived, his dutiful letters to Nina in Great Barrington with
Yolande would help fill in the large blanks of this first sojourn abroad
since the full summer of 1900.

The emotional lift from the upper-middle-class European salons in which
Du Bois dined and conversed as an outstanding personality unstigmatized
by color went a long way toward drawing the poison from wounds he tried
never to let show in America. In Europe, his confident bearing and
reserve marked him as a gentleman, as a person whose prepossession
elevated him above the common run of subjects and citizens of any
country. Yet, as he pedaled, gaitered, through soft summer countrysides,
stopping at inns and cafÃ©s, his thoughts occasionally turned to the
ceaseless struggle for personal and collective respect in his native
land and the contrasting graciousness of his European hosts and of the
ordinary people casually encountered along the way. He let himself dream
a bit in this summer Europe ""of past beauty and present culture, fit as
I fondly dreamed to realize a democracy in which \[he\] and \[his\]
people could find a welcome
place.""[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-60){#cha-60} He returned
home to sentinel duty along the color line (and a skirmish with Monroe
Trotter at the Niagara meeting) in a much better frame of mind.

He needed to be. Racial tensions in America were rising sharply, and
Alfred Holt Stone was among those inciting them. The explosive exodus of
African-Americans from the South known as the Great Migration was less
than a decade away, but the early beginnings of the massive relocation
to the urban North had already caused great concern among social
reformers and much resentment among low-income northern whites. About
185,000 African-Americans had streamed into Chicago, Cleveland,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and New York since 1890, 30,000 more than all
those who had come in the previous twenty years. Like Richard R. Wright,
the able AME bishop who had moved to Chicago from Augusta, Georgia, in
1899, many of the vanguard migrants were so highly motivated and
educated that their coming came to be called ""the migration of the
talented tenth.""[[61]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-61){#cha-61} But
even though they came before lynching and the boll weevil would push and
the northern labor recruiter pull them out of the South after 1916, they
were largely as unprepared for the pace, anomie, and exploitation ahead
as many of the Italians, Poles, and Hungarians pouring into these same
cities; but, unlike the incoming ethnics, their skin color would mark
them for special abuse. Paul Laurence Dunbar's 1902 novella, [The Sport
of the Gods,]{.epub-i} foresaw the splintering of families and descent
into moral license and crime awaiting large numbers of these migrants.
The likes of Florence Kellor, Jane Addams, Susan Wharton, and Mary
Ovington had bustled forward to help manage the disorder. Alfred Stone,
however, spoke for those who saw in the disorder the exigency of stern
and bloody correction.

At the 1907 meeting of the American Sociological Society in Madison,
Wisconsin, that December, Stone read his paper ""Is Race Friction in the
United States Growing and Inevitable?"" Du Bois, a member of the society
since 1905, had agreed to respond along with Willcox and three other
scholars. If there had ever been any doubt about the Mississippi
planters views, Madison resolved the question. Race friction resulted
from what Stone called a ""natural contrariety, repugnancy of qualities.""
It emerged from ""pressure"" the white man feels ""almost instinctively in
the presence of a mass of people of a different race."" Quoting from ""The
Future of the Negro Race in America,"" Du Bois's wide-ranging, thoughtful
essay in the January 1904 British magazine [East and the West,]{.epub-i}
Stone gleefully underscored Du Bois's contention that civil rights meant
""the abolition of the color line."" In stark opposition to such
sentiments, Stone coolly proposed that the very vitality of American
democracy was directly dependent upon a ""concomitant intolerance toward
men of another race or color."" More candid than many of the
distinguished professors who preferred measured statements and tentative
conclusions, Stone's crimson peroration nevertheless spoke to most of
them in their hearts: ""The superiority of race cannot be preserved
without pride of blood and an uncompromising attitude toward the lower
races.""[[62]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-62){#cha-62} Either white
supremacy must maintain itself through the logic of force or, said
Stone, it would be swallowed up in a mongrelization on the pattern of
Latin America.

If it occurred to Du Bois that the ideas of his own ""Conservation of
Races"" had returned to haunt him in a demented form, he must have felt
relieved that Stone appeared not to know this early essay. Unable to pay
his way to the Madison meeting, Du Bois's rejoinder had to wait for
publication in the May 1908 volume of the [American Journal of
Sociology]{.epub-i} (his paper was said to have arrived too late to be
read). ""A Reply to Stone"" was unusually restrained, even complimentary
in places, but it dismissed the planter's argument as regressive,
countering his apocalyptic pessimism with optimistic historicism.
Although his own racial beliefs had once been perilously close to the
planter's (were ambivalent still), Du Bois was careful to avoid
reference to ""instinct,"" ""folkways,"" ""pride of blood,"" ""consciousness of
kind,"" and other popular sociological concepts in opposing Stone.
Instead, he proclaimed that the Zeitgeist was operating through
economics. ""A new standard of national efficiency is coming,"" he
maintained. ""And that efficiency is marked by the way in which a great
modern advanced nation can be neighborly to the rest of the world.""
Nowhere did he admit as much, but to a large extent Stone's argument
must have prompted Du Bois to stress economic explanations of collective
behavior. His former collaborator's Darwinian rhetoric was of no
""particular importance, except when it encourages those Philistines who
really believe that Anglo-Saxons owe their preeminence in some lines to
lynching, lying, and slavery, and the studied insult of their helpless
neighbors. God save us from such social philosophy!"" he exclaimed in
closing.[[63]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-63){#cha-63}

But the Zeitgeist was to prove far more recalcitrant than anticipated.
Du Bois's appealing turn of phrase (intended to correct Stone's dire
prediction) that ""the world is beginning to work for the world,""
reflected the confidence he and many other racial liberals placed in
economic and scientific progress. But it was a seriously flawed
hypothesis. The grim truth was that the march of science and industry
tended to exacerbate race relations in the North as well as the South,
rather than to improve them---at least in the short term. With
industrialization came competition under capitalism, classes struggling
to maintain status, and races being manipulated against one another.
Patriarchy and noblesse oblige were as untenable in Birmingham, Alabama,
or Charlotte, North Carolina, as they had become in the Chicago
stockyards or the textile mills of Paterson, New Jersey. For all his
field research and pioneering, however, it would not be Du Bois but
Robert Park, Booker Washington's former ghostwriter who was well along
the road to becoming recognized as the University of Chicago's leading
sociologist, who would come closest to a valid formulation of
twentieth-century racial adjustment. In Park's race-relations cycle,
contact between different races generated sharp competition, followed by
a period of accommodation, leading, eventually, to assimilation. In ""The
Future of the Negro in America,"" Du Bois had identified perpetual
serfdom, extinction, outmigration, and full citizenship as the four
possible destinies of his people, with full citizenship as the almost
certain long-term
fate.[[64]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-64){#cha-64} Yet Park's was
the kind of Hegelian elaboration that might well have occurred to Du
Bois, had he not found himself handicapped by professional disabilities
surrounding the race he so devoutly wished to study objectively.

In the climate of national victimizing, Du Bois began to feel like the
legendary Canute bidding the waves to obey his commands. It was
impossible to ignore the dismal implications of American democracy and
racism, for it was cruelly apparent that a sense of full citizenship
came to many white newcomers the instant they learned to call others,
whose forebears had come long before, ""nigger."" To some extent, Du Bois
might suffer the quickly learned racism of the humble from abroad, but
when high-born Massachusetts men---for example, a Harvard overseer, and
an Adams at that---published articles in [Century Magazine]{.epub-i}
that were ""ill-considered and wrong but \[also\] distinctly sensational
in the worst sense,"" he rushed to repair the damage trowel in hand. ""I
trust that before publishing further matter on the race problem, you
will study it,"" he upbraided the supremely distinguished
historian-businessman Charles Francis Adams, Jr., great-grandson of John
Adams and son of the Civil War ambassador to the Court of Saint James.
""To this end I am sending you some
literature.""[[65]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-65){#cha-65} Adams
replied that he took his instruction from no lesser authorities than
Booker Washington and Alfred Stone.

Du Bois's experience with the Sons of the American Revolution in summer
1908 abraded his ego in its innermost core. Following to the letter the
procedures forwarded by the Massachusetts chapter of the Sons, he had
painstakingly accumulated evidence from muster rolls and tax registries
of his eighteenth-century ancestors participation in the War of
Independence. Family pride---from a man who felt so ambivalent about
much of his family history---was an expression of self-confirmation, an
exorcising of Alfred's taint through official recognition of Tom
Burghardt's few days of military service and of his own legitimate,
unbroken descent from the Great Barrington warrior. Told that his
credentials for admission had been approved by the Massachusetts chapter
of the Sons of the American Revolution, Du Bois savored what was to him
another crucial step in the plausible construction of a gentrified self,
one superior to all but the most exceptional man or woman, white or
black. Then came the communiquÃ© from the Massachusetts chapter that the
general secretary of the national Sons of the American Revolution in
Washington demanded proof of ""marriage of the ancestor 'Tom' Burghardt
and record of birth of the son."" Failing that, SAR headquarters would be
compelled to rescind the actions of the Massachusetts chapter, which it
promptly did, as Du Bois could provide no such
evidence.[[66]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-66){#cha-66} That
rejection seared his soul, although the decision of the national
headquarters may have been technically correct. It seemed to be the
cruellest of affronts in a cruel, affronting world.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[THE AUGUST]{.epub-sc} 1908 Niagara gathering in Oberlin, Ohio, was
poorly attended. Du Bois himself reached Oberlin on the mend from an
early August tonsillectomy performed in Chicago's Provident Hospital.
Ovington missed it because of her father's poor health and had been
""very unhappy,"" especially as Du Bois had agreed to let her speak for
twenty minutes on behalf of the Socialist party. She wrote Du Bois not
to flag an instant ""with the effort to win the rights of manhood for
every Negro in the country."" It was a warm letter, reminiscing about the
""memorable time"" at Harper's Ferry and striking a Socialist note about
Republicans and Democrats. ""There is a workingman's party in the
country,"" Ovington reminded Du Bois. ""How can the Negro belong with any
other?""[[67]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-67){#cha-67} There was no
Fred McGhee at Oberlin either. The Minnesota criminal lawyer, who had
been among the first to take on the Wizard, had withdrawn from active
participation in the movement after the Boston meeting. Driving himself
brutally in his work (he would be dead in four years), McGhee felt he
had to choose between his practice and Niagara. ""Yet something worth the
doing has been done,"" he was pleased to say as he took his leave of the
executive committee. The worldly wise Charles Chesnutt seemed never
quite to be able to arrange his summer schedule to permit attendance at
a Niagara meeting, and that of 1908 also took place without him. In
August 1903, Chesnutt had written one of the wisest, longest, and most
eloquent appraisals of the Wizards racial philosophy ever to be read by
the master of The Oaks. The Cleveland author and insurance executive was
certain that Washington's ""institution, your system of education,
whatever it may be, is too apt to dwarf everything else and become the
sole remedy for social and political evils which have a much wider
basis."" Organized, public opposition to Washington was not to Chesnutt's
taste, however. Whether another gifted novelist, the Baptist preacher
Sutton Griggs, came to Oberlin is unclear, but Du Bois was pleased to
make known that the Tennesseean was ""interested"" in the
movement.[[68]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-68){#cha-68}

Maintaining interest in the movement had become as challenging for Du
Bois as winning a foundation research grant. The Tuskegee Machine had
done all it could to stifle and intimidate through patronage,
philanthropy, and the press. Max Barber's star-crossed career served as
a daunting object lesson to prudent breadwinners. William Lewis, once a
promising militant, was the new U. S. assistant attorney for the six New
England states, a heady object lesson to the ambitious. Contributions
from Episcopalian and Baptist plutocrats were remitted to Hampton and
Tuskegee as dutifully as Sunday collection-plate tithings. The Niagara
Movement was not listed among approved charities. But, in the final
analysis, defeat came as the Niagarites met the enemy and discovered the
enemy to be themselves. The movement was not large enough to accommodate
two moving forces---Du Bois and Trotter. The Morgan-Trotter truce had
disintegrated immediately after the 1907 Boston meeting, and the
Wizard's agents moved to exploit the feuding. Hosting a sumptuous
banquet in one of Boston's finest hotels to honor Du Bois, William Lewis
invited Morgan, Forbes, GrimkÃ©, Ferris, and others for whom the
[Guardian]{.epub-i} had only criticism or ridicule, omitting an enraged
Trotter from the guest list. Reporting to Tuskegee, Lewis chortled, ""the
pins are all down but one."" In retaliation, Trotter demanded that Morgan
be removed as secretary of the Massachusetts chapter and that all state
secretaries be elected locally rather than appointed by the general
secretary. Du Bois made matters worse when he succumbed to
understandable impatience and finally peremptorily backed Morgan. At
least that was the heartsick Ovington's view. She heard the snickering
of the Bookerites and almost admonished her hero to be more
understanding. It was such a pity, she wrote Du Bois, because Morgan was
really insufferably conceited, while Trotter, of whom she had once been
wary, she ""had grown increasingly to
admire.""[[69]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-69){#cha-69}

A midwinter meeting of the Niagara Executive Committee in Cleveland
(with Du Bois and Trotter absent) accomplished little more than the
drafting of a pious circular to the membership pleading for
conciliation. Instead, there was animus and drift. In early April 1908,
Trotter effectively abandoned the Niagara Movement by presiding over the
founding of the Negro American Political League, not only a rival
organization but, according to Trotter's publicity about it, one that
included an unconsulted Du Bois and Fred McGhee, as well as other
Niagarites. The Negro American Political League would have numerous
incarnations after 1908---National Independent Political League,
National Independent Political Rights League, and, finally, National
Equal Rights League (NERL), but it remained, above all, an extension of
Trotter's eccentric honesty and phenomenal energy, and of the
[Guardian.]{.epub-i}[[70]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-70){#cha-70}
Their loss was fatal to Niagara. The general secretary continued to put
up a game front, as in an oddly plain letter earlier that year to a
prospective member: ""I am glad you like the Niagara men. They are a fine
set of fellows if we can only keep them together and keep them working.""
But by summer 1909, the number of Niagara members writing to Du Bois of
""never look\[ing\] forward to anything with as much joy as meeting that
body of manly men,"" as attorney J. R. Clifford did, was fast dwindling.
And Clifford himself would miss the August 1909 meeting at Sea Isle
City, New Jersey. The movement, Du Bois sighed, ""began to suffer
internal strain from the dynamic personality of Trotter and my own
inexperience with
organizations.""[[71]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-71){#cha-71}
Trotter's obduracy and Du Bois's calm self-certitude had factionalized
the Niagara Movement to such a degree that the members found that in
coming together they only exposed and exacerbated their divisions.

Du Bois's situation at Atlanta University underwent a much-needed
superficial improvement in early July 1908 when President Ware finally
made available a room in the basement of Stone Hall to serve as an
office. A few weeks later Du Bois was even able to expand his office
space when a Miss Hancock agreed to give up her recitation room. This
stroke of good fortune came about through an eleventh-hour grant of a
thousand dollars from the Slater Fund to cover conference-studies
expenses. A dollop of Slater money had made possible the most recent
Atlanta University Study, [The Negro American Family,]{.epub-i}
completed that May and on its way to the
printer.[[72]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-72){#cha-72} This 1908
conference brought Jane Addams to Atlanta, a presence Du Bois immensely
valued, finding scarce funds to pay her expenses from Chicago. Insisting
that Addams accept the hospitality of the university rather than stay
with white friends in the city, he explained that otherwise Addams might
find all manner of mysterious mishaps suddenly obstructing her way to
the campus. [The Negro American Family]{.epub-i} contained Addams's
settlement-house insights into ethnic family life in the urban North, as
well as Ovington's comprehensive survey, ""The Negro Family in New York.""
In ""The Economics of the Family,"" Du Bois's students had produced
detailed drawings of eight African-American homesteads in Georgia
ranging from low-income to affluent. Urban manners, diet, dress, and
education in urban alley homes and spacious residences in stable
neighborhoods were meticulously
described.[[73]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-73){#cha-73}

As a frame of frozen sociological time, [The Negro American
Family]{.epub-i} was of major importance. But coming nine years after
[The Philadelphia Negro,]{.epub-i} it was jarringly regressive in
language, if not erroneous in its conclusions that sexual mores were the
Negroes' overriding problem, making their family life ""less efficient
for its onerous social duties."" The economic factors behind weak primary
institutions still remained enveloped in Victorian values, as had been
the case in [The Philadelphia Negro.]{.epub-i} The fragile nuclear
family with its handicapped father and thin culture were legacies of
slavery, Du Bois posited, grating the modern ear with the conclusion,
""This does not mean that \[the African-American\] is more criminal in
this respect than his neighbors. Probably he is not. It does mean that
he is more primitive.""[[74]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-74){#cha-74}
He persisted in emphasizing the legacy of slavery to such an extent that
he often tended to understress the modern reasons for that legacy's
continuing to impede. Yet he remained inconsistent, trying, with
increasing success, to distance himself from the prevailing racial or
cultural hypotheses that excluded or minimized economic exploitation. In
May 1907, he had already written excitedly of the fatal analytical flaws
Washington economist Max Rubinow exposed in census chief Willcox's
racial explanations for the disparity in white and black mortality
rates. Du Bois quoted Russian-born Rubinow as explaining that ""we have
here not a dying of black folk but a slaughter of the
poor.""[[75]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-75){#cha-75} Du Bois would
begin to internalize such insights.

With the last-minute Slater Fund grant that July, he would successfully
undertake the 1909 [Efforts for Social Betterment among Negro
Americans,]{.epub-i} also valuable, especially for its data on
African-American women's self-help organizations. Fortunately, although
there was less money to carry on, there was more talent available due to
the return the previous year of Augustus Dill from Harvard, where he had
taken a second bachelor's degree. Dill, class of 1906, was one of Du
Bois's ablest students. His graduate work in sociology was so exemplary
that Atlanta University bestowed one of its rare master's degrees on him
in 1908, at the end of his first year back on campus. The word
[bonze]{.epub-i} best described Dill, a rotund little man with a
perfectly round brown head. Fastidious and a predestined bachelor, he
would find his greatest enthusiasms in life with service to Du Bois, his
demanding mentor. From 1908 until Du Bois's departure in 1910, Dill
collaborated on each Atlanta University Study. Thereafter, he directed
them until the last one in 1914, and then left to join Du Bois in New
York at the new National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.[[76]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-76){#cha-76}

With thirteen studies in as many years by 1908---uneven in quality but
useful, and several still recognized as archetypes---Du Bois now saw
that his work in Atlanta was even further from winning significant,
sustained foundation support than it had been when he produced the 1898
[Efforts of American Negroes for Their Own Social Betterment.]{.epub-i}
His researches were still living hand to mouth, dependent on
extraordinary interventions by influential sympathizers like Seligman at
Columbia or token sums funneled through respected racists like Stone.
Even so, this loose change barely kept the recipient's vital signs from
becoming increasingly feeble. ""The Finance Committee have made up their
minds that we have got to curtail still more until Atlanta University
has prospect of a larger annual income,"" Ware notified his prize faculty
member after the 1908 conference on the family. Despite the words of
Harvard's Eliot, quoted in the university's 1909 brochure, encouraging
the public to realize that ""the colored race in our land must have its
own representation in all departments of professional life,"" such
sentiments were alien to the dominant philanthropic thinking. ""Eventual
withdrawal from Atlanta University seemed wise,"" Du Bois had about
decided. He was sure that Ware had been told that ""under certain
circumstances increased contributions from the General Education Board
and other sources might be expected,"" and it was clear that he was one
of those
""circumstances.""[[77]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-77){#cha-77}

But it was not quite time to leave, and he threw himself into two
projects that might still turn things around. In early April 1909, he
wrote to Edward Blyden in Sierra Leone and a score of other authorities
concerning his scheme for an ""Encyclopedia Africana,"" a multivolume
study ""covering the chief points in the history and condition of the
Negro race."" From Blyden, the doyen of black nationalism, he requested
names of several outstanding white men to serve on the encyclopedia's
international advisory board, stressing, nevertheless, that ""the real
work I want done by Negroes."" His plan was ""still in embryo,"" but within
a few weeks Du Bois was generating an extensive correspondence about the
project. His stationery announced that the first of five projected
volumes would appear in 1913, the ""Jubilee of Emancipation in America
and the Tercentenary of the Landing of the Negro."" Seeking Eliot's
inclusion, he informed the Harvard president that August that some sixty
distinguished authorities in numerous fields had agreed to serve on the
editorial board. Eliot declined, but Harvard was already well
represented by Hart, James, and Hugo Munsterberg. The English
ethnographers Harry Johnston and Flinders Petrie, Professor Giuseppe
Sergi of Italy, and scholars from Germany, France, and Belgium joined
Columbia's Franz Boas and Clark University president Granville Stanley
Hall on the encyclopedias letterhead. Du Bois's unhappiness with Kelly
Miller and Archibald GrimkÃ© had abated sufficiently for him to persuade
these old Committee of Twelve adversaries to serve on the board along
with African-American notables John Hope, Benjamin Brawley, Bishop
Scarborough, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Sutton Griggs, Anna Jones, George
Edmund Haynes, Richard Greener, and a half dozen
others.[[78]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-78){#cha-78} The Gold Coast
barrister and newspaperman Casely-Hayford also agreed to serve.

Du Bois had assured Blyden that the encyclopedia project could be ""put
through,"" but he was again mistaken about the enlightened disposition of
influential and potent whites. Wallace Buttrick's four-year-old
statement that the GEB head wished ""it were within my power to cooperate
with you in ways more practical"" was still as meaningless as
ever.[[79]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-79){#cha-79} Du Bois's vision
of an ""Encyclopedia Africana"" dimmed, but, a quarter century later, he
would resurrect it as the ""Encyclopedia of the Negro,"" and almost
succeed in endowing it with resources adequate to its large purpose.
Eighty years later, he would find the resources for the [Encyclopedia
Africana]{.epub-i} in Nkrumah's Ghana. By then, of course, his own
physical and intellectual resources would be nearing their epochal term.

At first, it had seemed to be easier to implement his plans for an
enlarged [Horizon.]{.epub-i} Since the monthly magazine's debut in
January 1907, Du Bois had written on a vast array of subjects in [The
Horizon']{.epub-i}s ""Over-Look"" column---socialism, peonage, books, and
voting; Roosevelt, Taft, Bryan, and Stone; Darwinism, race relations,
the struggles of Jews, Ray Stannard Baker's investigations, Africa, and
particularly Niagara. His collaborators had their columns, as well:
Hershaw's ""Out-Look"" and Murray's ""In-Look."" Du Bois's influential
""Over-Look"" was invariably better written and more hard-hitting, as with
the controversial ""Negro Vote"" piece for August 1908: ""Standing then in
the presence of the Republican and Democratic parties we have to ask
ourselves: not, which party stands for our principles---neither does.""
It was a matter of trading votes for favors: ""Because two-thirds of the
Democrats (that is, the Northern Democracy) have long deserved our
support, and would do more to deserve it if the solid Negro vote did not
put them in slavery to the Solid
South.""[[80]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-80){#cha-80} This was an
argument groping toward the balance-of-power dictum that would
eventually rule African-American political strategy to a large degree.

Another significant ""Over-Look"" piece, of remarkable eloquence even for
Du Bois, was devoted to Ida Dean Bailey, a Niagara colleague's deceased
wife. It reflected the author's brand of heroic feminism, praising this
dedicated, terminally ill woman's service as joint-secretary of the
women of the Niagara Movement, her ability to be ""companion and
co-worker of menÂ ... \[and\] leader and confidante of women."" Du Bois
offered Ida Bailey as a model: ""She was born to play a part on a world
stage---no narrow pent-up niche of life for her, but great sweeping
vistas and glorious vision of eternal success."" Unfortunately, there
were more contemptible white men than exemplary women to write about.
[The Horizon]{.epub-i} noted that Lyman Abbott weeped in [The
Outlook]{.epub-i} for justice toward the Filipinos and that his ""heart
just aches for Russia,"" but the American race problem passed again
without comment. The Negro pavilion at the Jamestown Exhibition was
three quarters of a mile from the midway, ""away from everybody and
everything."" ""The Peabody fund of \$1,000,000 left for education in the
South has been given to a Tennessee institution which bars black
Southerners. Mr. Peabody is still
dead.""[[81]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-81){#cha-81}

The pocket-sized, twenty-eight-page [Horizon]{.epub-i} appeared
regularly, had a larger and more stable circulation than [The]{.epub-i}
Moon, and was printed on better paper. The early issues carried some of
the poetic and literary effusions on Africa, women, and racism that Du
Bois would republish in [Darkwater.]{.epub-i} ""The Song of the Smoke,""
""The Burden of Black Women,"" and ""A Day in Africa"" were passionate,
moving pieces of Victoriana. Some, like the molten ""My Country 'Tis of
Thee"" in the November 1907 issue, seemed to curl the pages:

[My country tis of thee,]{.epub-i}

[Late land of slavery,]{.epub-i}

[Of thee I sing.]{.epub-i}

[Land where my father's pride]{.epub-i}

[Slept where my mother died,]{.epub-i}

[From every mountain side]{.epub-i}

[Let freedom
ring!]{.epub-i}[[82]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-82){#cha-82}

But despite the vigor of prose and principles, the magazine sputtered
along, with Du Bois and his fellow publisher-editors working without
salary and putting several hundred dollars of their own money into the
venture. As with [Moon]{.epub-i} collaborators Simon and Pace, Du Bois
had his hands full keeping Murray and Hershaw on speaking terms. At one
point (July 1908) friction was so great that Murray sulked and refused
to hand over the list of subscribers to Hershaw. The exasperated Hershaw
told Du Bois he was ""convinced that it is useless for Murray and myself
to attempt further to collaborate in the business affairs of the
[Horizon.]{.epub-i}"" The lurching of the magazine from printing presses
in Washington to Alexandria, Virginia, and then back to Washington in
1909 played havoc with the business, as Du Bois's March 29, 1909,
apology to subscriber A. B. Humphrey at the Republican Club in New York
indicated. Returning Humphrey's dollar, Du Bois explained, ""The men are
perfectly honest but they seem quite unable to keep
accounts.""[[83]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-83){#cha-83}

While his partners feuded, Du Bois negotiated with Milholland and
Barber, now associated with the Constitution League (expensively
quartered across from ""the classic pile,"" said Milholland of the
Forty-second Street Library) to merge the league's proposed new magazine
with [The Horizon.]{.epub-i} Du Bois was fond of Milholland and seemed
amused by the generous, tough Irishman's occasional affectation of
aristocratic manners. The goals of Niagara and the league were fully
compatible and the financial resources of wealthy manufacturer
Milholland impressive. Once again, a fair-sailing document in precise Du
Bois prose circulated from Atlanta. Out of the merger a [New
Horizon,]{.epub-i} published in New York, with Du Bois as
editor-in-chief and Barber as managing editor, was supposed to come.
There would be an interracial board, and \$25,000 in start-up capital
raised with Milholland's help. But once again, ambition and resources
went separate ways. Murray broke his arm, causing a delay in production.
Finally, in November 1909, an eight-by-eleven-inch [Horizon: A Journal
of the Color Line]{.epub-i} (reduced to twelve pages) appeared. It was
not the large, well-funded magazine Du Bois's circular had promised, but
another labor-intensive coup of the three editors who were somehow still
working together. The promised [New Horizon]{.epub-i} had been
abandoned, however, its aborted merger with Milholland's league
unexplained.

Still, Du Bois told Hershaw he thought ""the first number of the
[Horizon]{.epub-i} was
excellent.""[[84]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-84){#cha-84} It was
certainly defiant. ""THIS IS A RADICAL PAPER,"" Du Bois announced. ""It
stands for progress and advance. It advocates Negro equality and human
equality; it stands for Universal suffrage, including votes for women.""
There was a brief account of the fifth annual meeting of the Niagara
Movement. It was vintage Du Bois: ""On us rests to no little degree the
burden of the cause of individual Freedom, Human Brotherhood, and
Universal Peace in a day when America is forgetting her promise and
destiny. Let us work on and never despair because pigmy voices are
loudly praising ill-gotten wealth, big guns and human degradation. They
but represent back eddies in the tide of Time. The causes of God cannot
be lost.""[[85]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-85){#cha-85} In the
December issue, under the ironic title ""Constructive Work,"" a merciless
caricature of the Wizard's achievements appeared. If the magazine's
future was in doubt, subscribers to the January 1910 edition would never
have guessed it reading Du Bois's upbeat ""The Balance"": ""We have
progressed. The chains are still clanking, the coward and the traitor
are still at large, the poor and guilty and unfortunate are still with
us. Our enemies smile. So do we. We have progressed."" [The
Horizon]{.epub-i} would vanish at the end of the year, but the effort of
keeping it alive would prove to be of incalculable value when Du Bois
turned to the challenge of launching his next
magazine.[[86]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-86){#cha-86}

Without money, both scholarship and advocacy faltered. The university's
trustees doubted the conferences could be kept going much longer. For
want of enough subscribers, [The Horizon]{.epub-i} was certain to follow
[The Moon]{.epub-i} into extinction, taking along with it hundreds of
the partners' scarce dollars. Money worries were threatening to keep Du
Bois from reading a paper on Reconstruction at the December 1909 meeting
of the American Historical Association, an appearance Du Bois regarded
as a personal honor and a racial challenge. Explaining his withdrawal
from the panel to Hart, he confessed that he couldn't ""afford the
expense of coming North."" Harts former student's financial straits were
a detail easily remedied, however, and, thanks to Hart, within the week
Du Bois was able to confirm his participation in the American Historical
Association session in New York. Another star of Hart's graduate
seminar, Oswald Villard, declined to participate as a commentator for Du
Bois's paper. He would merely risk exposing his own ""monumental
ignorance"" of the topic, Villard explained, but he also warned that Du
Bois ""was rather unsafe on the
question.""[[87]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-87){#cha-87}

The AHA paper contained the germ of Du Bois's massive, revisionist book,
[Black Reconstruction,]{.epub-i} then twenty-five years off. Coming at
the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, ""Reconstruction
and Its Benefits"" was a reinterpretation incompatible with the
contemporary historiography, advancing facts and arguing positions
diverging so radically from what the gentlemen listening to Du Bois knew
that it could find no meaningful place in their tradition of inquiry. To
suggest that there had been benefits to Reconstruction was equivalent to
descrying benefits in the aftermath of plague. Only a few feet away from
the lectern on which Du Bois arranged his speech sat Columbia
University's William Archibald Dunning, high priest of the regnant dogma
in Reconstruction writing---the Dunning School, whose successive
generations of historians deplored the decade of federal intervention in
the South as a ""tragic era"" of Negro misrule. That some African-American
politicians had been corrupt, that many of the former slaves were easily
misled and exploited, Du Bois conceded with specifics. ""Granted then
that the Negroes were to some extent venal but to a much larger extent
ignorant and deceived,"" the real issue, Du Bois told his fellow
historians, was whether or not ""they show\[ed\] any signs of a
disposition to learn better things?"" It was the failure of the federal
government to create and sustain an effective Freedmen's Bureau,
""established for ten, twenty or forty years with careful distribution of
land and capital and a system of education for the children"" that
allowed the perpetuation of slavery in other forms. In the midst of all
these difficulties, ""The Negro governments in the South accomplished
much of positive good,"" he concluded on a note never before sounded
among professional historians. The collaboration of white Democrats and
black politicians ""of the better elements"" late in Reconstruction to
exorcise scandal and recapture public confidence in Louisiana, South
Carolina, and Mississippi had been buried underneath post-Civil War
scholarship until Du Bois exhumed it for his New York audience. ""We may
recognize three things which Negro rule gave to the South,"" he
concluded: ""1. Democratic government. 2. Free public schools. 3. New
social legislation.""[[88]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-88){#cha-88}

Finding Reconstruction historiography standing on its head, Du Bois
could have said that he had left it upright. Hart wrote how ""very proud""
he was of his student's impressive ""ability to handle complicated
materials."" ""Reconstruction and Its Benefits"" had elicited much comment,
he crowed to Du Bois a few days after the AHA meeting, adding that
""Professor Dunning also had spokenÂ ... of the paper in high
terms.""[[89]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-89){#cha-89} The July 1910
volume of the [American Historical Review]{.epub-i} published the paper,
after which virtually nothing more was ever said among white
professional historians about its heterodox interpretation. Scholarship
concerning the politics of race now served the urgent goal of regional
reconciliation in which the African-American's place was one of
unquestioningly merited subordination. For these reasons, Du Bois's
cogently reasoned paper virtually failed to have any impact upon the
mainstream scholarship of the day.

The impact on Du Bois, however, was considerable. A curious thing
happened to ""Reconstruction and Its Benefits"" on the way to
publication---one more tap of the coffin nail, as Du Bois saw it.
Returning the proofs for the article to the [American Historical
Review,]{.epub-i} he asked editor J. Franklin Jameson, ""as a matter of
courtesy,"" to be allowed to capitalize the word Negro. If on no other
issue than this one, Du Bois and Washington were in total agreement;
each of them consistently urged the adoption of upper-case treatment by
mainstream publications. Du Bois's [Suppression]{.epub-i} and
[Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} monographs had been among the first to
have the noun placed in capitals, and Washington's success in getting
Doubleday, Page and Company to capitalize the word in [Up From
Slavery]{.epub-i} represented a significant breakthrough. It was not a
concession Jameson felt he could make. Du Bois insisted, crisply
dismissing the argument that ""mere uniformity in office practice is
sufficient excuse for inflicting upon a contributorÂ ... that which he
regards as a personal insult."" Jameson's long, agitated reply of June
22, 1910, either missed the larger point raised by Du Bois or (more
likely) intentionally obfuscated it with a profession of personal
innocence in all matters of racial prejudice. He was, he wrote,
""astonished"" that he, the ""grandson of an old Abolitionist, brought up
to know no difference between black and white,"" could be charged with
insulting a professional colleague, and so on. Negro---Spanish for
black---had nothing to do with nationality, with American or German or
Hindu, any more than ""white man, brown man, or red man,"" which were mere
characterizations of physical traits. ""The question was simply one of
typography,"" Jameson assured Du Bois; but in any case, nothing could be
done about it in the [American Historical
Review.]{.epub-i}[[90]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-90){#cha-90}

In future disputes over the capitalization of Negro Du Bois would be
more combative. This time he let his article appear under Jameson's
rules but not without a final sharp correction about the ""authority of
that usage"" in Europe, Great Britain, and increasingly this country. He
regretted deeply that Jameson had ranged himself ""with the least
authoritative and more insulting
usage.""[[91]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter13-91){#cha-91} The [American
Historical Review]{.epub-i} skirmish was just one more incident bringing
home to Du Bois the fact that his solution of the race problem through
scholarship was no more likely than the Wizard's civil rights nostrums
of industry and good behavior to break the shackles of cultural,
political, and economic retardation.

W[ILBERFORCE]{.epub-sc}

[Book, Mentor, Marriage]{.epub-bi}

A[LMOST TWO]{.epub-sc} years after returning to America,
twenty-eight-year-old Professor Du Bois paused for breath and brought
John Dollar up to date. Ticket fare home and two dollars had been the
sum total of his wealth when he left the [Chester,]{.epub-i} he wrote.
As the train home had risen into the Berkshires, his own spirits had
fallen at the prospect of two months or more in Great Barrington's
well-intentioned curiosity, genuine pride, and inevitable jealousy.
After dazzling them with travelogues at the Congregational and AME Zion
churches, what was there to talk about with the black Burghardts or with
GBHS pals who had become bank clerks and shoe salesmen? ""It was too much
of a disillusionment,"" he wrote his English listening post. With no
money, Slater Fund debts, no positions available at any white college or
university, and rural Tennessee authorities dismayed by a German-trained
scholar's offer to teach public school, Du Bois was a perfect
illustration of one of Booker T. Washington's jokes about the perils of
runaway education. It was as though ""the bottom of the universe was
loose and might go down if, after all this learning, \[he\] stepped full
feet upon it.""[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-1){#cha-1}

The striking imagery was not quite apt, though; it was Du Bois, not the
bottom of the universe, who had been in danger of dropping from sight.
""I raise my hat to myself,"" the [Autobiography]{.epub-i} boasted later;
he had quickly steadied his shaken confidence, and sat down to write
dozens of inquiries: to Howard, Hampton, Fisk, Tuskegee,
Wilberforce---""so many letters that I scarcely remember where.""
""President Washington, Sir! May I ask if you have a vacancy in your
institution next year?"" one letter had inquired of the Tuskegee
Institute principal on July 27, 1894. ""The hot months rolled by and
answers came slowly,"" he told Dollar. ""It wasn't too much for a colored
man with a Harvard A.M. to expect a bread and butter job---was
it?""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-2){#cha-2} Actually, the replies
had come fairly quickly. Booker T. Washington's telegram arrived in
Great Barrington on August 25: ""Can give mathematics here if terms suit.
Will you accept. Wire answer."" By then, however, Du Bois had eagerly
accepted the August 17 telegraphed offer of \$800 a year to occupy the
classics chair at Wilberforce University. He had felt honor-bound to
decline a second generous \$1,050 annual salary offer from Lincoln
Institute in Missouri. ""So late in hot August,"" Du Bois had departed
Great Barrington for the oldest college for Negroes in the United
States. The turning-point prose of the [Autobiography]{.epub-i} shifts
into paean: ""Life was now begun and I was half happy. Up through the
Berkshire Valley with its quiet beauty, then across New York I glided,
wrapped in dreams. The lights of Buffalo bade me goodnight, and half
asleep, I drifted across
Ohio.""[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-3){#cha-3}

The village of Wilberforce was about twenty miles southeast of Dayton
and three dusty miles of buggy tracks from Xenia, the nearest
incorporated town. Yellow Springs, seat of Antioch College, was ten
miles due north---if anything in that part of western Ohio had been
reachable directly. But this was rolling farmland where roads meandered
through cornfields and forded rock-bedded streams under covered bridges.
It was native country to Middle America's truest novelist, Sherwood
Anderson, then an unfocused seventeen-year-old dreaming of adult life in
Chicago. Wilberforce had come into being as the sylvan solution to the
sins of slaveholding fathers. The place was originally called Tawawa
Springs by the Native Americans, after the health-giving waters that
drew rich planters to summer there in the early decades of the
nineteenth century. The rambling, 350-room Tawawa Springs, with its
arbored fountains and manicured grounds, was perhaps the most unusual
resort hotel in America, however, because its clientele consisted of
slave masters, their concubines, and their
children.[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-4){#cha-4} The Quakers of
the region deplored this monument to concupiscence with its langorous
mores and rainbow population---the likes of which they might have
expected to find on the banks of the Amazon, but certainly not a mere
160 miles south of antislavery Oberlin.

The savage Panic of 1837 and militant Ohio abolitionism gradually killed
the great hotel, inducing a group of planters to buy the property for
use as a school for their children from the other side of the blanket.
In 1852, the white Methodists of Xenia acquired Tawawa Springs, renaming
it after Britain's premier abolitionist, Bishop William Wilberforce,
incorporating it as a university four years later. The African Methodist
Episcopal denomination, the oldest religious sect in black America,
bought the school in 1863, and twenty-four years later a wily black
politician on his way to becoming an AME bishop introduced a bill in the
Ohio legislature to create the ""Combined Normal and Industrial
Department at Wilberforce University""---guaranteeing, in one fell swoop,
a rising annual appropriation from Ohio's taxpayers for one of the rare
American universities under the authority of both church and state. The
politician's bill also institutionalized racial segregation in the
state's system of higher
education.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-5){#cha-5}

When President S. T. Mitchell fetched Du Bois from the waiting room of
Xenia's railroad station on a late-summer afternoon in 1894, then,
Wilberforce University had been the flagship institution of the AME
Church since the school's purchase thirty-one years earlier by the
sainted Bishop Daniel A. Payne for ten thousand dollars. A tiny, beige
man of powerful intellect and austere principles who had reigned over
fellow bishops and much of the AME denomination through sheer force of
character, freeborn Daniel Payne had worn out his delicate frame through
fund-raising in Europe and America. His death as presiding bishop the
previous November had greatly unsettled the Wilberforce community, as
another bishop, a man of flatter vision and values, who had lived until
then in Payne's shadow, imposed his will. Du Bois told Dollar that he
would never forget seeing the Wilberforce president's smile the first
time---""it was the prettiest smile of any man I ever
saw.""[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-6){#cha-6} Pretty, but not
genuine; an accomplished executioner's smile. President Mitchell clearly
was not going to turn out to be cast from the mold of Erastus Cravath,
Charles Eliot, or Daniel Payne.

Du Bois was encountering a new species, whose mid-twentieth-century
perfection would be reached in novelist Ralph Ellison's saturnine Dr.
Bledsoe in [Invisible Man.]{.epub-i} Beholden to trustees concerned
solely with racial good behavior, here grand inquisitors, there
enlightened despots, these dynasts presided over Afro-America's other
institutional pillar, the school (in its incarnations as institute,
college, or university), with all the trappings of royalty but seldom
royalty's true noblesse. For Du Bois, the effeminate, devious President
Mitchell became ""the most perfect realization of what the devil might be
in the closing years of the 19th \[century\]."" Behind the devil, though,
there was Moloch himself---heavyset, one-legged Benjamin William Arnett,
Sr., one-time member of the state legislature, church powerhouse,
chairman of Wilberforce's trustee board, and soon to be chief advisor in
all Negro matters to fellow Ohioan and twenty-fifth U.S. president,
William McKinley.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-7){#cha-7} The
authority of President Mitchell was as nothing compared with the real
power and influence of Bishop Arnett, who, now that the restraining
influence of Daniel Payne was no more, intended to rule the university
like a satrapy, monitoring and even controlling its curriculum, and
periodically increasing its faculty with several of his five ambitious
sons.

The first thing the seventeenth bishop of the AME Church had done was to
fire William Scarborough, Wilberforce's most distinguished professor,
from the chair of classics. Born in slavery to Georgia parents able to
read and write, Scarborough had earned degrees in Greek and Latin from
Atlanta University and Oberlin College. Only the third African-American
admitted to membership in the American Philological Association, the
classics professor's [First Lessons in Greek]{.epub-i} (1881) was a
standard textbook and his translation of Aristophanes' [Birds]{.epub-i}
(1886) critically lauded. But these were times in higher education when
tenure was in most places still tenuous, and the courtly classicist
quickly ran afoul of Bishop Arnett's nepotistic politics. ""But I had
assumed that I was to assist"" Scarborough, an unsuspecting Du Bois
stuttered upon discovering that he was instead the bishops answer to
faculty murmurings over the sacking of its most prestigious
member.[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-8){#cha-8}

Into this Machiavellian situation Du Bois ""landed with cane and gloves,""
innocent, arrogant, and dedicated to pedagogical standards that were no
more useful to the bishop and president than the declensions found in
Professor Scarborough's Greek textbook. He found the pastoral campus
setting Edenic, but the culture of the community seemed to him not just
parochial (that he had expected), but primitive and hysterically
religious. People at Wilberforce flaunted their religion at every
opportunity. Revival meetings could sweep the campus like wildfire,
emptying classes for days and leaving students either too agitated or
too exhausted for serious work for many days thereafter. Wandering into
a religious gathering soon after arriving, the new faculty member heard
a devout student say, ""'Professor Du Bois will lead us in prayer.'""
Snapping back, ""'No, he won't,'"" Du Bois believed he had only narrowly
escaped the summary fate of his predecessor because of his bottomless
capacity for work. That the new professor of Latin and Greek (and, as he
discovered, English, German, and history) might be some sort of agnostic
or a believer in impersonal forces would not have occurred to the bishop
and his trustees. Their charitable conclusion that Du Bois (whose
appointment had received publicity in the Negro press) was a sardonic,
brainy eccentric easily worth twice his salary saved
him.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-9){#cha-9}

Ego and enthusiasm made for a zestful combination. Du Bois ""wanted to
help build a great university,"" readily taking on a schedule that worked
him from daybreak chapel to final evening prayers. He tried to convey to
his first-year Greek class something of the meaning and excitement of
Sophocles' [Antigone,]{.epub-i} and one student in particular, Charles
Burroughs, responded brightly and recited well. This same Burroughs
would serve Du Bois faithfully years later in connection with Du Bois's
ambitious pageant, [The Star of Ethiopia.]{.epub-i} The new professor
suggested a new course in sociology, but President Mitchell and Bishop
Arnett, not knowing what to make of it, firmly declined to sanction the
experiment. He served on the student disciplinary committee. ""My program
for the dayÂ ... looked almost as long as a week's program now,"" he
recalled.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-10){#cha-10} There is a
rare, weary diary entry for this period:

and my soul! but by this time I am weary---a struggle with Antigone's
struggles by wise and spectacled youths, all fading away into dull
headache and the bell for noon chapel.... The bit of day that comes
between my last recitation and dinner is a source of great anxiety to
me: I dislike to waste it and yet I can find little to fit in here
except making my bed or taking a short walk. I eat dinner alone, before
the crowd arrives and run a gauntlet of greetings back to my room. Then
comes the longest hour of the day: in my tilted armchair, with the daily
papers and a red apple I lose myself until the bell brings me back to
Wilberforce.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-11){#cha-11}

Lonely, hard work had paid off in the past, but not at Wilberforce.
""Nothing stirred before \[his\] impatient pounding! Or if it stirred,""
Du Bois sighed of his efforts to quicken minds, ""it soon slept
again.""[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-12){#cha-12}

During the first year at the University of Berlin, he had sketched the
plot and written forty-seven pages of an uncannily prescient
autobiographical novella, ""A Fellow of Harvard."" George Smith, who was
""smart but a bit odd,"" briefly attends ""X"" College, declines a
divinity-school scholarship, and, like the author, finally reaches
Harvard. Studying in Europe on fellowship, Smith questions the meaning
of life, becomes a committed Socialist, and, unable to finish his
Harvard dissertation, accepts a teaching position in a southern Negro
school ""where his eccentricities get him in trouble with the blacks and
his radicalism with the whites."" Beleaguered, Smith finishes the
dissertation, which is published as a ""brilliant
success.""[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-13){#cha-13} Du Bois's
prodigious capacity for work had enabled him to finish his
twelve-chapter Harvard doctoral dissertation, ""The Suppression of the
African Slave Trade to the United States of America, 1638--1870,"" that
first academic year. Like Smiths, it was destined for a brilliant
success.

Much of the dissertation had already been worked up over a thirty-month
period from late 1889 through most of 1891, but he had put it aside
while working on southern land tenure under Schmoller and Wagner at
Berlin. With the research done, Du Bois concentrated on shaping his
argument and, ""in some degreeÂ ... transforming a dry historical treatise
into readable prose,"" as he put it
later.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-14){#cha-14} Curiously,
although the text of the monograph mailed to Harvard is typed in blue
ribbon, the footnotes and their raised numerals are in Du Bois's best
left-handed cursive, an indication of last-minute haste and probable
difficulties with the typist. Albert Hart not only affixed his signature
of approval to the dissertation on June 1, 1895, but he also recommended
it for selection as the initiating monograph for Harvard Historical
Studies, one of the earliest series of university-sponsored scholarly
publications in the United States (after those at Johns Hopkins,
University of Nebraska, and
Brown).[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-15){#cha-15} It would be
published in 1896 by the firm of Longman, Green & Company for Harvard
(the university's press was yet to be incorporated).

[The Suppression of the African Slave Trade]{.epub-i} was constructed on
royal edicts, parliamentary and colonial proceedings, federal and state
acts and statutes, census tabulations, court decisions, naval reports,
bills of lading, and newspaper accounts. It was beyond reproach in its
sweeping use of published materials and archival digging, an outstanding
example of the new historiography of interpretation fused to fact that
Hart demanded of his students. Document by damning document, Du Bois
built his case for rife American participation in the internationally
banned Atlantic trade until the cumulative evidence grew to be
overwhelming that, after 1840, the Stars and Stripes in South Atlantic
waters had become the pennant of slave cruisers, whose cargoes were
immune from inspection. By 1850--1860, he argued, ""nearly all the
traffic found this flag its best protection."" Looking at the North
American slave population after the August 1619 arrival at Jamestown,
Virginia, of ""twenty negars"" aboard a Dutch man 'o war, Du Bois
concluded that its terrific increase to 700,000 in the 1790 census, 2
million in that of 1830, and finally to 3,953,760 thirty years afterward
was due to importation from Africa, even after the 1808
ban.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-16){#cha-16}

In the well-received 1891 paper (""The Enforcement of the Slave Trade
Laws"") before the American Historical Association, he had calculated the
total number of Africans brought into North America during the long
colonial period at 530,000. The number illegally sold in the United
States after the 1808 federal banning of the Atlantic trade, Du Bois had
estimated then at ""not less than
250,000.""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-17){#cha-17} Certain,
therefore, that the Cotton Kingdoms population growth was the
consequence of ""a demand for land and slaves greater than the country
could supply,"" Du Bois reasoned in [Suppression]{.epub-i} that there had
been a fatal ""bargain"" between an indifferent and later corrupted North
and a single-minded South resulting in a fifty-year nonenforcement of
federal and state laws against further importation of Africans. His
evidence disclosed for the first time the determined push during the
1850s of Deep South slaveholders to nullify the constitutional
prohibition. It was not the practice in turn-of-the-century American
scholarship to arraign the framers of the Constitution and to charge
that the public morality of the new nation had been corrupted by
clandestine commerce in the Atlantic slave trade. ""It is neither
profitable nor in accordance with the scientific truth to consider that
whatever the constitutional fathers did was right,"" the young scholar
lectured (with the venerable historian George Bancroft's orthodoxy
clearly in mind), ""or that slavery was a plague sent from God and fated
to be eliminated in due
time.""[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-18){#cha-18}

At the grand moment in 1789 when slavery could have been destroyed (a
Jamesian live option), the Founders had basely compromised. The
""bargain"" struck between the commercial North and the agrarian South
over the closing of the Atlantic trade had left the Frankenstein monster
breathing and the live wires from it inserted into Article I, Section 9,
of the federal constitution, providing that: ""The migration or
importation of such persons as any of the States now existing shall
think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the
year one thousand eight hundred and eight""---thereby permitting the
monster to grow too large nineteen years later to be destroyed short of
a war. What Du Bois could not have known, however, was that, although
many Americans in the two decades before the Civil War were becoming
rich from transporting human cargo from Africa, the overwhelming
majority of the slaves was not transported to the southern United States
(excluding Louisiana) but to Cuba and
Brazil.[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-19){#cha-19} It was an
inevitable mistake that was not only logical but, in the final analysis,
immaterial to the larger question of his argument's validity; it was the
sort of mistake, nevertheless, that would generate strident academic
correction. Seventy-eight years later, a sharp deflation of Atlantic
slave trade numbers occurred when Professor Philip Curtin's exhaustive
and now prevailing estimates became available. Instead of the 15 million
to 50 million Africans historians had assumed to have been thrust into
the wasting ""middle passage"" to North and South America, the new figures
shrank to a fairly precise 9,566,100. Instead of Du Bois's illegal
250,000 imported after 1808, the authoritative Curtin figure was
54,000.[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-20){#cha-20}

What historians now knew (and Du Bois's contemporaries did not) was that
the astonishing growth of the North American slave population came not
from continuous and rising importation from Africa but from its own
domestic birth curve and falling mortality rate---unlike the sugar
economies of Cuba and Brazil in which high mortality of slaves was
compensated for through high importation. Slaveholders in the American
South not only mainly grew their own labor force, they encouraged living
conditions that kept their investments alive, generally healthy, and
augmenting in value.[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-21){#cha-21} In
turn, the rising value of the domestic slave population caused most
planters to oppose clandestine importation of slaves in order to protect
the market values of their human investments. Du Bois would have hooted
at such claims of market-driven humanitarianism, and indeed did so in
[Suppression.]{.epub-i} Once upon a time, he conceded, there may have
been a softer, more ""patriarchal serfdom"" in Virginia and the Upper
South before Eli Whitney ginned the Cotton Kingdom into fevered
existence. But after 1820, the large slaveholders ""found it cheaper to
work a slave to death in a few years,"" he wrote, ""and buy a new one,
than to care for him in sickness and old
age.""[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-22){#cha-22}

Yet if the percentage of all the men, women, and children brought from
Africa to the United States was barely 5 percent, or about 399,000, of
the total number imported into the Western hemisphere in four centuries
of the Atlantic slave trade, the substantial increase in the slave
population had been driven by the white South's employing something like
scientific use, abuse, and expansion of its labor force. The story of
North American suppression of the Atlantic slave trade was more complex
than Du Bois suspected, even though he proved much of his case for fifty
years of national hypocrisy, nonfeasance, and collusion fueled by
economics. And while it was true that the demographic consequences
attributable solely to nonenforcement were not nearly as great as he
believed, the real implications in [Suppression]{.epub-i}---of vast
profits coming not from the maritime slave trade but from the total
slave-economy universe---should be understood as pathfinding. It would
become characteristic of his scholarship that Du Bois's brilliant
insights often transcended flawed specifics. The chapter in
[Suppression]{.epub-i} on Toussaint L'Ouverture and the Haitian
revolution for the first time linked the American suppression of the
Atlantic slave trade and Jefferson's fire-sale acquisition of Louisiana
to that island's bloody insurrection and its defeat of the large
expeditionary forces sent by Napoleon to reconquer it. The widespread
alarm triggered by the Haitian overthrow of slavery had disposed
colonial Americans to stop the flow of slaves into their new
republic.[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-23){#cha-23}

Because the volume of information Du Bois poured into
[Suppression]{.epub-i} fell like rainfall over a continental divide,
much of it draining off into nineteenth-century channels of thought and
values while a good deal flowed forward into the new basin of
twentieth-century social science, the book is split between two worlds.
Its prose is inflected by period-piece adjectives qualifying public
behavior as ""vacillating,"" ""immoral,"" or ""discreditable,"" by loaded
phraseology such as ""the cupidity and carelessness of our ancestors.""
Kantian imperatives flash out, such as ""the plain duty of a Revolution
based on 'Liberty' to take steps toward the abolition of
slavery.""[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-24){#cha-24} As the
unsigned reviewer in the [Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i} patronizingly
pointed out, Du Bois was guilty of repeatedly moralizing about the wages
of original sin. ""Instead of calling the whole moral energy of the
people into action, so as gradually to crush this potential evil,"" the
Wilberforce professor lectured his readers, there was temporizing,
cowardice, horse-trading, and complicity. In another twist of the blade,
Du Bois doubted ""if ever before such political mistakes as the slavery
compromises of the Constitutional Convention had such serious results.""
[Suppression]{.epub-i} ended with an admonition that the otherwise
favorable reviewer (unsigned) in [The American Historical
Review]{.epub-i} regretted as more characteristic of ""the advocate
rather than the historian."" ""From this,"" Du Bois sternly declared, ""we
may conclude that it behooves nations as well as men to do things at the
very moment when they ought to be
done.""[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-25){#cha-25}

Nearly sixty years after Longman, Green & Company published
[Suppression,]{.epub-i} Du Bois would write an ""Apologia"" to a new
edition of his first book, published by the then Columbia University
graduate student Eugene
Genovese.[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-26){#cha-26} In many ways,
it remains its most perceptive criticism. In the ""Apologia,"" he
regretted that he had failed to build on the excellent preparation under
William James for understanding the social implications of Sigmund
Freud. He reproached himself for missing the irrational and psychosexual
energies behind what men and women said and did about the importation of
slaves to North America. More Freud would have meant less of his own New
England moral code in the reading of motives and expectation of
principled public conduct. That virtually no other American historian or
sociologist of his generation was exploring sexual and subconscious
forces inherent in movements and institutions was but minimal comfort to
the then eighty-six-year-old
scholar-activist.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-27){#cha-27} But
though he would come to understand why he had failed to apply Freud to
the rise and fall of the Atlantic slave trade, he was almost unable to
forgive himself six decades afterward for missing Marx---still blaming
Frank Taussig, a little unfairly, for being ""absorbed in a
reinterpretation of the Ricardoan 'Wages Fund.'"" What
[Suppression]{.epub-i} had needed, Du Bois concluded, ""was to add to my
terribly conscientious search into the factsÂ ... the clear concepts of
Marx on the class struggle for income and power, beneath which all
considerations of right or morals were twisted or utterly
crushed.""[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-28){#cha-28}

Had his first book been written only a few years later, say, 1905
instead of 1895, the writings of Freud, Marx, and Max Weber might have
impelled him to probe beneath the moral and political superstructure of
the slave trade. Yet finally, here, too, he would concede that he asked
too much of his late-nineteenth-century mind-set to have been ""as wise
in 1896 as I think I am in 1954."" ""Apologia"" would end on the moderately
forgiving note that, ""at the beginning of my career, I made no more
mistakes than apparently I
did.""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-29){#cha-29} Yet if much of
[Suppression]{.epub-i} reduces social and political conduct to a matter
of character (and Du Bois certainly believed in character), its numerous
economic pronouncements have a distinctly modern, we might say
proto-Marxist, ring. Despite the moralizing, at bottom Du Bois
understood the source and force of slavery in the United States to lie
in an indissoluble link between profits from unfree labor and the
financing of modern capitalism. He had made that unmistakably clear in
the 1891 AHA paper:

If slave labor was an economic god, then the slave trade was its strong
right arm; and with Southern planters recognizing this and Northern
capital unfettered by a conscience it was almost like legislating
against economic laws to attempt to abolish the slave trade by statutes.
Northern greed joined to Southern credulity was a combination calculated
to circumvent any law, human or
divine.[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-30){#cha-30}

His chapter on the Cotton Kingdom opened with the engrossing sentence,
""The history of slavery and the slave trade after 1820 must be read in
the light of the industrial revolution through which the civilized world
passed in the first half of the nineteenth century."" Here was a jackpot
observation that might well have taken control of the author; instead
its startling brilliance faded before it could become a transforming
paradigm---or even a fruitful tangent. As he would say with soft regret
much later, he still ""seemed to miss the clear conclusion that slavery
was more a matter of income than
morals.""[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-31){#cha-31}

It is puzzling that Du Bois failed to carry his bedrock economic
interpretation fully over into his first book, that, rather than apply
himself to an audacious elaboration, he was content to make penetrating
allusions. A late-Victorian intellectual temper, not yet capable of
radically doubting the paramountcy of ideas in history, is a partial
explanation only, as is the keen satisfaction Du Bois always derived
from exposing hypocrisy in white people's hallowed institutions. One
possibility is that he may have worked out the economic implications
enough to suspect that they could wreak havoc upon
[Suppression]{.epub-i}'s main thesis---that of an interregional bargain
sealed by profits from an illicit slave traffic. However much some
northern interests may have benefited from the economics of slavery, it
was, as Du Bois well understood, those other and larger economic
profits, dependent upon protective tariffs and an advancing frontier of
industry, free soil, and free labor, that increasingly governed the
politics of North and West. It was during the 1840s and '50s, after all
(the very decades that supposedly yielded maximum illegal profits), that
the economic and political grounds for the Civil War were laid. A more
neutral, impersonal rendering of motives and behavior---in keeping with
a rigorous economic analysis (with a far-fuller exploration of
countervailing trends)---could have left Du Bois wondering how to make
his thesis apply to the final two decades before the Civil War. His
interregional bargain might have looked more like a trumping of the
South by the North. Finally, had he even been disposed to argue for an
enveloping economic determinism, Du Bois would have sensed that by
reducing morals exclusively to a function of profits he would be
nullifying the major African-American strategy for improving race
relations through leverage on the national conscience.
[Suppression]{.epub-i} was written, after all, at the very moment when
economic forces were forging a new interregional deal at the expense of
dark-skinned Americans whose last best defense was to invoke the
nation's most exalted religious and civil ideals.

Had Du Bois done more research and spent a good deal more time
reconceptualizing, he might have succeeded in mating economics to morals
in a revised work of genius, rather than one simply written by a genius.
As it stands, the economic analysis has been correctly if ungenerously
dismissed by ahistorical critics as naive and not organically linked to
the book.[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-32){#cha-32}
[Suppression]{.epub-i} may not have been the book Du Bois intended to
write, but a fallback monograph after his German disappointment, and the
sooner he had his doctorate, the sooner there would be life after
Wilberforce. A pioneering, flawed work, it was, as his literary executor
claimed, ""the first full-length product of Afro-American scientific
scholarship"" and, as the [Nation]{.epub-i} reviewer observed, one that
""is an honor alike to its author, to the university whose approval it
has received, and to American historical
scholarship.""[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-33){#cha-33} In his
""Apologia"" Du Bois knew it was unnecessary to remind readers that it was
still a useful classic.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[AS HE]{.epub-sc} retrieved his dissertation from the hard-pressed
typist to send to Hart, Du Bois probably anticipated the impending
Wilberforce commencement exercises with annoyance. The bishop and his
courtiers paraded the campus in high collars and cutaways, expecting and
receiving obsequious attention while orations of marathon duration
competed. The coming of the Episcopal priest Alexander Crummell, a
commencement speaker and one of the most distinguished black men of the
century, was the single bright spot in a week's ordeal. The Crummell
encounter would leave a deep imprint on Du Bois, one that would become
sharper and deeper in the few years remaining before the clergyman's
death. Crummell's struggles as a pastor in New Haven (where Alexander Du
Bois had lent him what support he could) and his remedial sojourn at
Cambridge University were long behind the recently retired pastor of
Washington's St. Luke's Episcopal, a black tabernacle of such refinement
as to have attracted the occasional attendance of President Chester
Arthur and banker William
Corcoran.[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-34){#cha-34}

Crummell had assumed his duties in Washington in 1873, after nearly
twenty years of mission labor in Liberia on behalf of the Episcopal
Church. With another black expatriate, the tactless, brilliant West
Indian Edward Wilmot Blyden, he had spearheaded the building of churches
and schools to speed assimilation of Liberia's indigenous peoples:
Kpelle, Bassah, Mano, and Kru who, like Native Americans, were being
trampled and pushed aside by the Americo-Liberians---ex-slave settlers
from Maryland and Virginia. Monrovia's new Liberia College was largely
Crummell and Blyden's idea---their instrument for preparing the
""ignorant, benighted, besotted and filthy"" Americo-Liberians for the
work of Christianity and civilization. Crummell's had been an active,
controversial ministry, abruptly terminated by a coup d'Ã©tat and the
flight of his benefactor, Edward Roye, president of the
republic.[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-35){#cha-35}

Crummell and Blyden, along with a handful of other well-trained men (and
one or two women) such as Presbyterian minister Henry Highland Garnet,
Episcopal bishop James Holly, AME bishop Henry McNeal Turner, and Martin
Robinson Delany (one of the angriest and most resourceful), were
forerunners of the Pan-Africanism and black nationalism that would
expand early in the next
century.[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-36){#cha-36} They formed an
articulate chorus calling for the cream of Afro-America to be resettled
in Haiti or South America or West Africa (or, as Garnet pleaded, if not
Africa, wherever his people could become ""great and powerful by
colonization"")---acrimonious partisanship prevented agreement---where by
thrift and uplift ""the intention of the Divine Mind towards Africa""
could be fulfilled. Passions of color also divided them (Crummell and
Garnet detested mulattoes), as did those of religion---Methodists had
little use for Episcopalians and vice versa. But all were Victorian
imperialists---""Afro-Saxons""---to whom native Africans were religiously
and socially ""primitive"" and always sexually
scandalous.[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-37){#cha-37} Blyden
justified the European Scramble for Africa, rationalizing that it would
teach ""the natives to make the best use of their own country."" And
whatever their feelings about being outsiders in Anglo-Saxon
civilization themselves (Bishop Turner hoped to see it destroyed,
whereas the Sierra Leonean James Africanus Horton desired greater
collaboration), as anguished [assimilÃ©s]{.epub-i} they dreamed of
replicating that civilization as the ""highest and the best yet evolved
in the history of the human race"" on their own terms among ""less
developed"" cousins.[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-38){#cha-38}

When Martin Delany, who burst racial stereotypes like tape across a
finish line (he was Harvard's first black medical school student),
turned up in Liberia near the end of 1859, Crummell had served as
advisor and host under the palms at sleepy Cape Palmas. Delany and his
""Niger Valley Exploring Party"" pressed on to Nigeria, where in December
they persuaded the [alake]{.epub-i} of Abeokuta to sign a treaty
permitting members of the ""African race in America"" to establish a
colony. Delany concocted a catchy, arrogant slogan: ""Africa for the
African race, and black men to rule
them.""[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-39){#cha-39} Reading a
providential augury into Delany's appearance, Crummell had hurried to
the United States to raise money and preach the doctrine of manifest
black destiny in Africa (""Ethiopianism"" or ""civilizationism,"" as his
exacting biographer dubs it). Unhappily for him, his fund-raising tour
coincided with the South's secession from the Union and the sudden and
total indifference of American Negroes to emigrationism. Delany had then
immediately abandoned his cotton-empire dream in Africa for a major's
epaulettes in the Union Army (becoming Afro-America's highest ranking
officer) and then an intrigue-filled career in postwar South Carolina
politics, coming finally to settle and die in Wilberforce, Ohio, shortly
before Du Bois took up his
professorship.[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-40){#cha-40}

Although Crummell had soon returned to Liberia alone and with only
enough funds to pay his own passage, he left behind two publications
whose contents would be scattered widely by delayed fuse: [The Relations
and Duties of Free Colored Men in America to Africa]{.epub-i} (1861),
and [The Future of Africa]{.epub-i} (1862). Four years after his final
return to America as St. Luke's pastor, Crummell had planted another
explosive charge with ""The Destined Superiority of the Negro,"" a
take-heart sermon timed to inspire black Americas leadership during the
terrible post-Reconstruction era he saw approaching. The publication
date, 1877, was significant---that very March the Republicans had
frantically bartered just enough electoral votes in the bitterest, most
corrupt election aftermath ever in order to hang on to the White House.
In accordance with a deal in large part struck at Wormley House, the
deluxe Washington hotel owned (ironically) by a black man, Rutherford
Hayes's first act had been to call back most of the federal troops from
the South while northern capitalists smacked their lips in anticipation
of Congress's voting lavish subsidies for more transcontinental
railroads. Henceforth, the white South would take care of its black
people and the North would take care of most of the nation's business.
[The Nation]{.epub-i} had said starkly what President Hayes had no need
to say publicly about the African-American: ""Henceforth, the nation, as
a nation, will have nothing more to do with
him.""[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-41){#cha-41}

Crummell's ""The Destined Superiority of the Negro"" would light up the
coming bleakness with Plato, Hegel, Johann von Herder, and, with
admiration bordering on imitation, FranÃ§ois Guizot, the infamously smug
prime minister-historian of France's July Monarchy (King
Louis-Philippe's bourgeois regime overthrown in 1848). ""The Almighty
seizes upon superior nations and, by mingled chastisement and blessings,
gradually leads them to greatness,"" Crummell
prophesied.[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-42){#cha-42} This Old
Testament premise he then linked to a Christian dialectic and a Social
Darwinism of his own divining in which inexorable laws of God and nature
wiped out weaker, non-Christian peoples like the Native Americans or the
Pacific Islanders in order to advance ever-higher moral and material
conditions---for Crummell, Anglo-Saxon civilization, in short. His
""civilizationism"" even led him to praise for a time the colonizing work
of Africa's greatest despoiler, Leopold II, King of the Belgians, for
its ""noble
imagination.""[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-43){#cha-43}

Thus, the more history tested the Negro the more he emerged as chosen,
as ""taller, more erect, more intelligent, and more aspiring than any of
his ancestors for more than two thousand years of a previous era."" Count
de Gobineau's racist classic, [Essai sur l'inÃ©galitÃ© des races
humaines,]{.epub-i} sneered that Africans were imitative, artistic,
""feminine"" in intelligence. Crummell agreed; only he inverted these
qualities on his own racial superiority scale, imitation being for him
the stuff of racial greatness. In a notable turn of phrase describing
the ancient Greeks and Romans as ""cosmopolitan thieves,"" Crummell
preached that imitation was even the authentic source of hardy,
aggressive, ""masculine"" Anglo-Saxon greatness. Black imitation of the
highest in white civilization foretold ""that superiority and eminence
which is our rightful
heritage.""[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-44){#cha-44} Yet this
erudite Episcopalian priest was no more willing than Marx to leave
history running entirely on autopilot. Vain, pedantic, autocratic,
blessed with early advantages in education and career (owing much to
aristocratic white New Yorkers), Crummell feared working-class white
people and lacked confidence in the mass of black
people.[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-45){#cha-45} He liked
neither the social-contract theory of John Locke nor the individualism
of Thomas Jefferson. It was the duty of educated, high-principled elites
among all peoples---but especially among African peoples---to promote
the work of Providence by preaching, teaching, and leading the common
folk into abstinence, monogamy, cleanliness, and
thrift.[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-46){#cha-46}

Although Crummell no longer espoused emigration to Africa these days,
his catechism of Negro chosenness was as forceful as ever. The task now,
he proclaimed and disseminated in a stream of pamphlets, was to build
the moral fiber and institutions of the race in America, and he assigned
to the recently freed women of the South a vital, transforming role in
this endeavor. Among black men of his day, and men in general, the
learned priest stood out boldly for solid education and full rights for
women---""without them, no true nationality, patriotism, religion,
cultivation, family life, or true social status"" was
possible.[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-47){#cha-47} If the
reality of the crucial role he assigned them was quintessentially one of
dutiful support in which men were made wiser and stronger in their
supremacy as a result of them, Crummell's intentions were still
enlightened for his times. In sermons such as ""The Black Woman of the
South, Her Neglects and Her Needs,"" he dwelt heavily upon the role of
women in abating the lingering pathologies of slavery days through
strong nuclear families---an emphasis that would contribute to the
evolution of the school of Black Family scholarship, stretching from Du
Bois to E. Franklin Frazier and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan.[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-48){#cha-48}

Such was the Mosaic quality of the man who came to preach at Wilberforce
in the spring of 1895. ""Father"" Crummell, as he was widely known, was
now a stately seventy-six, his thinning hair and beard heavily salted,
yet he still walked with the regal step of his princely West African
forbears. What Crummell had to say impressed Du Bois as much because of
the messenger as for the message. ""Instinctively I bowed before this
man, as one bows before the prophets of the world,"" he recalled almost a
decade after the Wilberforce
meeting.[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-49){#cha-49} St. Luke's
emeritus favored a Platonic conception of social change that reduced
economic realities to mere shadowy reflections on the wall of a cave.
Not only did man not live by bread alone, the rapt faculty and students
in Shorter Hall were told, but the problem of bread took care of itself
once higher matters had been attended to. ""The material aspect is only
the surface aspect,"" Father Crummell explained. ""There has rarely, if
ever, been a strike, a labor riot, an industrial disturbance, an
Agrarian outbreak, in all the history of man, but what has had an
underlying, some absorbing moral problem which agitated the souls of
men."" Great ideas were the wheels of history; all else was false motion.
""Man never passes beyond the boundary lines of dull content into the
arena of strife or agitation, unless some deep moral conviction first
circles his brain and fires his blood or tingles his
imagination.""[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-50){#cha-50}

""The Solution of Problems: The Duty and Destiny of Man,"" Crummell's
commencement sermon, would have sounded deep metaphysical chords in Du
Bois after study in Germany. In Crummell's sermon there were echoes of
Herder's ""law of humanity,"" reconciling the contending individual with
the universal, and louder ones of Crummell and Du Bois's beloved Hegel,
iterating that the ""rational is the real and the real the rational."" The
heroism of moral struggle, involving abnegations that the small-minded
found pitiable and whose triumphs would in time confound the skeptics,
Du Bois had already embraced in favorite lines from [Faust.]{.epub-i}
Yet if history made sense---moral sense---Crummell stressed that it did
so only when the noblest energies exerted themselves on its behalf. The
priest intended for the masses to be guided by a patient, fearless,
natural aristocracy of talent. The kernel of one of Du Bois's most
intriguing and influential future ideas, that of the Talented Tenth
leading the race---pulling it on to greatness---was all but tossed him
by the old priest.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-51){#cha-51}

Writing ""Of Alexander Crummell"" in [The Souls of Black Folk,]{.epub-i}
Du Bois would transform an opinionated old man into a racial cynosure,
describing their Wilberforce meeting and its impact with poignancy.
""Tall, frail, and black he stood, with simple dignity and an
unmistakable air of good breeding,"" was Du Bois's immediate impression.
They talked apart, ""where the storming of the lusty young orators could
not harm us."" Their hours together introduced the junior scholar, whose
models had thus far been Hosmer, James, and perhaps Schmoller, to a new
and profoundly significant racial archetype. Aside from Grandfather
Alexander, Crummell was the first living black man Du Bois found truly
worthy of emulating---the first to whom he deferred with ready affection
and intellectual affinity. Speaking to Crummell ""politely, then
curiously, then eagerly,"" the fatherless, self-created intellectual
sensed in this campus visitor a gentle yet strong wholeness of mind and
character whose development held enormous meaning for his own
career.[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-52){#cha-52} ""Some seer he
seemed, that came not from the crimson Past or the gray To-come, but
from the pulsing Now,"" Du Bois rhapsodized.

All his life Crummell had had to battle three temptations---hate,
despair, and doubt, of which the worst was doubt, Du Bois said. ""Of all
the three temptations,"" the prodigy from Great Barrington declared with
the force of personal experience, ""this one struck the deepest. Hate? He
had outgrown so childish a thing. Despair? He had steeled his right arm
against it, and fought it with vigor and determination. But to doubt the
worth of his life-work""---and here Du Bois surely was thinking of
himself---""to doubt the destiny and capability of the race his soul
loved because it was his""---this was soul-destroying doubt over which
Crummell had triumphed
magnificently.[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-53){#cha-53} In
""Alexander Crummell"" Du Bois offers a secular parable that mimics the
Calvary---a moral and racial instruction in which the anointed messenger
is tested, forsaken, rebuked, and allegorically sacrificed in order to
redeem a people. However, the unmistakable New Testament imagery no
longer represented deeply held religious convictions. By the time he
reached Wilberforce, Du Bois's religious views were wholly decoupled
from orthodox Christianity and from any notion of a personal deity. At
best, he recognized a vague presence manifesting itself in laws slowly
revealed through science---a force best expressed in Hegelianisms such
as [Weltgeist]{.epub-i} (world spirit) or [Dasein]{.epub-i} (presence)
and above all in private and without emotion. But although he had
relinquished the Bible's theology, Du Bois would hold in reserve the
language of the King James Version whenever, as with the import of
Crummell, he strove to give an idea maximum emotional
force.[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-54){#cha-54}

Recounting Crummell's determination to get a secondary school education,
Du Bois would tell how the early New York abolitionist Beriah Green had
braved community reproach in 1836 by bringing Crummell and his good
friend Henry Garnet to the Oneida Institute in Whitesboro, New York. In
all of North America, only Oneida, Gettysburg, Gilmore in Cincinnati,
and Oberlin admitted African-Americans at that time. In fact, Crummell
and Garnet, along with several others, had seen their New Canaan, New
Hampshire, schoolhouse yoked to oxen and dragged into a swamp by white
farmers indignant that black boys were learning algebra and
Latin.[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-55){#cha-55} Determined to
serve his people in a Providence, Rhode Island, church, Crummell ""worked
and toiled, week by week, day by day, month by month. And yet month by
month the congregation dwindled, week by week the hollow walls echoed
more sharply, day by day the calls came fewer, and day by day the third
temptation sat clearer and still more clearly within the Veil."" Doubt
came again. It was as if the nobler a prophet's commitment to the cause
of his people, the more vulnerable to anguish and self-pity he could be
in times of quotidian sloth and indifference. Writing on, filled with
empathy for himself and Crummell, Du Bois recreated the awful moment
when the priest heard ""his own lips whispering, 'They do not care; they
cannot know; they are dumb driven cattle,---why cast your pearls before
swine?'---this, this seemed more than man could bear; and he closed the
door, and sank upon the steps of the chancel, and cast his robe upon the
floor and writhed.""[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-56){#cha-56}

Then had come Crummell's joust with Bishop Benjamin T. Onderdonk of New
York. Du Bois's detailed account of that meeting, which led to
Crummell's being denied entry into the leading Episcopal seminary, was
somewhat mistaken, but the picture of porcine bigotry was as truthful as
it was exquisite: ""Bishop Onderdonk lived at the head of six white
steps,---corpulent, red-faced, and the author of several thrilling
tracts on Apostolic Succession."" Du Bois fancied he could ""see that
tableau: the frail black figure, nervously twitching his hat before the
massive abdomen of Bishop Onderdonk; his threadbare coat thrown against
the dark woodwork of the book-cases, where Fox's 'Lives of the Martyrs'
nestled happily beside 'The Whole Duty of Man.'"" In Du Bois's version of
the encounter, his hero refuses Onderdonk's demeaning conditions of
studying apart, retorting ""slowly and heavily: 'I will never enter your
diocese on such terms.' And saying this, he turned and passed into the
Valley of the Shadow of
Death.""[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-57){#cha-57} Rather than
succumb, Crummell wanders to England for more education. ""Restless
still, and unsatisfied, he turned towards Africa, and for long years,
amid the spawn of the slave-smugglers sought a new heaven and a new
earth."" Never faltering, seldom complaining (Crummell's intimates often
found him querulous, however), ""he simply worked, inspiring the young,
rebuking the old, helping the weak, guiding the
strong.""[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-58){#cha-58}

""The more I met Alexander Crummell,"" Du Bois continued, ""the more I felt
how much that world \[behind the veil\] was losing which knew so little
of him."" That the noble priest deeply penetrated the young scholar's
armor is obvious. Unlike Alfred Du Bois, about whom the son now probably
knew most of the unsavory truth, Crummell was an authentically
patriarchal force---austere yet compassionate, admonitory yet
trustworthy.[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-59){#cha-59} Despite
the gulf of years and different training, Du Bois sensed that Crummell's
demons, personal, professional, and racial, were very much like his own.
The priest ""did his work---he did it nobly and well,"" just as Du Bois
had done, denying himself loves, friendships, and conventional
satisfactions in order to pursue his calling to uplift a worthy people
through knowledge. Crummell had ""bent to all the gibes and prejudices,
to all hatred and discrimination, with that rare courtesy which is the
armor of pure souls.""[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-60){#cha-60}
The apostrophe with which Du Bois would wind up this essay is among the
tenderest things he ever wrote. For once, there is a hint of genuine
intimacy in the arresting prose. ""And herein lies the tragedy of the
age: not that men are poor,---all men know something of poverty; not
that men are wicked,---who is good? not that men are ignorant,---what is
Truth? Nay, but that men know so little of men."" The final, filial words
addressed to ""the soul I loved"" were meant for a saint: ""I wonder where
he is today? I wonder if in that dim world beyond, as he came gliding
in, there roseÂ ... a dark and pierced Jew who knows the writhings of the
earthly damned, saying, as he laid those heart-wrung talents down, 'Well
done!'""[[61]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-61){#cha-61}

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[CRUMMELL'S INFLUENCE]{.epub-sc} on his new disciple would continue for
decades, becoming almost too faint to detect only after Marx had taken
such hold of Du Bois in the 1940s that the priest was even denied a
place in the [Autobiography']{.epub-i}s index. To gauge that influence
and its broader consequences, we have to steal a march on chronology
before returning to celebrate Du Bois's twenty-eighth birthday in
Wilberforce. Two years after the visit to the campus, Du Bois would play
a major part in Crummell's new American Negro Academy. The date of the
academy's start-up meeting, March 5, 1897, a Friday morning, was the
127th anniversary of the Boston Massacre in which the mulatto seaman
Crispus Attucks had shed the first blood in the American Revolution.
Sixteen other men attended the meeting convened by Crummell at
Washington's Lincoln Memorial Church. That past December, five of
them---Crummell, the young poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, Howard University
philosopher Kelly Miller, Du Bois, and another---had met at the
Washington home of John Wesley Cromwell, lawyer, newspaperman, and
amateur historian, to plan this ambitious forum in an era when scholarly
speculation among African-Americans was a luxury as rare as Mississippi
snow.[[62]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-62){#cha-62}

Booker T. Washington was invited to the March assembly, but this had
been a formality and no one was surprised not to see him there. In fact,
as the engine of the new organization, Crummell intended for the academy
to welcome criticism of what was now known as the ""Tuskegee Idea."" When
he had come to Wilberforce in May or early June of 1895, Crummell
probably had no thought of openly challenging the rising race leadership
of Tuskegee Institute's formidable principal, Booker Washington, a
decision he finally, painfully, reached the following October. There was
much in the Tuskegee vocational program he found praiseworthy, as is
clear from his testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Education,
in which he identified trade schools as the race's most pressing
need.[[63]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-63){#cha-63} But even as early
as 1891, a certain tone and emphasis had increasingly begun to separate
the priest and the educator. Washington, for example, had apparently
taken to extolling the virtues of slavery as an early version of
citizenship training. It had made Christians of pagans. ""We went into
slavery without a language; we came out speaking the proud Anglo-Saxon
tongue,"" the educator was heard to rejoice on several occasions. ""If in
the providence of God the Negro got any good out of slavery, he got the
habit of work,"" was another favorite
bromide.[[64]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-64){#cha-64}

Crummell's own considerable admiration for English had stopped far short
of commending its inculcation through plantation slavery. He implied in
several sermons that Washington's claims for the benefits of bondage
were dubious. For Crummell, slavery had ruined both the African's honest
paganism and his morals. As for work, the African in America had had 250
years of it ""and everyone knew that itÂ ... never produced his
civilization.""[[65]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-65){#cha-65} The
Episcopal priest's ideas of education called for suiting instruction to
aptitudes, building on work and learning without any presumption of
limitations, and teaching courses in husbandry as well as hermeneutics,
Latin as well as landscaping---rather than, as Washington was doing at
Tuskegee, bending aptitudes to instruction. ""The primal need of the
Negro,"" Crummell once wrote to a journalist friend, ""is absorption in
civilization, in all its several lines, as a preparation for civil
functions, and the use of political power. Just now he is the puppet and
the tool of white demagogues and black
sycophants.""[[66]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-66){#cha-66}

Du Bois would hurry from Philadelphia, where he now worked after
escaping Wilberforce, to the 10:30 [A.M.]{.epub-sc} meeting in
Washington of the American Negro Academy. He seconded Crummell's
nomination for president with a filial ardor he would seldom confess
again in public. There was ""too little reverence"" among the race for age
and past achievement, the twenty-nine-year-old professor admonished,
""and I say right here, there could be no greater a reverence paid by us
to worth than by recognizing such a man as Dr.
Crummell.""[[67]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-67){#cha-67} As Du Bois
sat down to applause and an immediate unanimous vote for Crummell, the
new president of the American Negro Academy rose to deliver in his
measured voice an inaugural address whose title, ""Civilization, The
Primal Need of the Race,"" was a manifesto of high culture. Crummell told
the body that a race was civilized only when it produced ""letters,
literature, science, philosophy, poetry, sculpture, architectureÂ ... all
the arts."" ""No purblind philanthropy is to be allowed to make
'Industrial Training' a substitute for
it.""[[68]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-68){#cha-68} After this swipe
at Tuskegee, he went on to tell the academy members (everyone knew that
he had in mind the dead Douglass who, many said, had been turned by age
and a white wife into a radical assimilationist) that there were two
great heresies: ""That the colored people of this country should forget
as soon as possible that they ARE colored people""; and ""That colored men
should give up all distinctive efforts, as colored men, in schools,
churches, associations, and friendly
societies.""[[69]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-69){#cha-69} If, in the
mists of a far future, the priest did glimpse such harmony among peoples
that caste and race (like feudal rank and privilege) would gradually
pass out of history, for the indeterminate present racial chauvinism
would be the sole guarantee of later racial
integration---""assimilationist ends through separatist means,"" as
Crummell biographer Wilson Moses explains. ""If I forget that I am a
black man \[Crummell's wife, unlike Douglass's, was black\], and you
ignore the fact of race, and we both ostrich-like, stick our heads in
the sandÂ ... what are you and I to do for our social nature?"" No, they
must never forget, Crummell concluded in Lincoln Memorial Church, that
""we are a nation set apart in this
country.""[[70]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-70){#cha-70}

But the words that were to dominate these self-conscious Negro leaders
that March morning in 1897 were not those of Alexander Crummell, as
arresting as they were, but those of W.E.B. Du Bois. Dunbar; Scarborough
(now reemployed at Wilberforce); Miller; Francis GrimkÃ©, the
Princeton-educated natural son of a South Carolina GrimkÃ©; William Henry
Ferris, a young Yale prodigy; and the rest instantly sensed that
high-flown Platonism was being recycled according to the latest findings
in history and laws of sociology. Long and cruelly victimized by racism,
Du Bois began, the Negro had himself been led to ""deprecate and minimize
race distinctions."" Together with the great majority of all Americans,
the Negro embraced the Jeffersonian idea of democratic individualism,
which had led to that impatient, antihistorical optimism later
historians would call the doctrine of American exceptionalism---the
faith, said Du Bois, that ""while it may have been true in the past that
closed race groups made history, that here in conglomerate America [nous
avons changÃ© tout cela]{.epub-i}---we have changed all that."" But ""all
that"" had not changed. Implicitly drawing on Herder, Fichte, and
Friedrich Schleiermacher's ideas of separate but equal contributions by
the races and on Jacob Grimm's and von Treitschke's of irreducible
somethings in the human family, Du Bois, in his precise, dry voice,
intoned that there were differences---""subtle, delicate and elusive,
though they may be---which have silently but definitely separated men
into groups.""[[71]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-71){#cha-71}

Great confusion set in at this point, as the young professor wove back
and forth between the subjects of English parliamentarianism and free
trade, German excellence in science and philosophy, French and Italian
fecundity in music, art, and literature, and the contributions of the
""other race groups,"" hopelessly entangling nationality with race and
institutions with cultural
""traits.""[[72]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-72){#cha-72} Just exactly
what race was Du Bois never did manage to say clearly, although he
invoked the authorities Thomas Huxley and Friedrich Ratzel in support of
his conviction that there were three primordial examples---white, Negro,
and yellow; and eight ""historic"" ones---Teutons, Slavs, English of Great
Britain and North America, ""Romance nations,"" Negroes of Africa and
America, Semites, Hindus, and Mongolians. Crummell's gratification must
have been boundless when his new disciple paused to give memorable
Hegelian expression to the key idea: ""The history of the world is the
history, not of individuals, but of groups, not of nations, but of
races, and he who ignores or seeks to override the race idea in human
history ignores and overrides the central thought of all
history.""[[73]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-73){#cha-73}

Du Bois cast each ""race"" as a unique past, present, or prospective
player in a millennial pageant, a drama he would unveil over and again
in several forms and with numerous revisions. Some players, like the
Japanese, were already beginning to act their part. Others, like the
Negroes, must begin writing lines for the future. Those lines, of
course, would be spoken first by the ""advance guard of the Negro
people---the eight million people of Negro blood in the United States of
America,"" and, Du Bois had no need to add, with American Negro Academy
members serving as drama coaches. But were not Negroes in America simply
Americans who happened to be Negroes in melting-pot America? Inscribed
on the very coins were the words ""E Pluribus Unum"" (out of many, one),
reminding Irish, Italians, Germans, Jews, Slavs, Hispanics, Asians, and
others in America that hyphens were un-American. Not only was there no
terminology yet to describe cultural pluralism when Du Bois wrote ""The
Conservation of Races,"" but the idea for what urban writers like
Randolph Bourne, Hutchins Hapgood, Horace Kallen, and Waldo Frank were
to call ""trans-nationalism"" was almost universally regarded as heretical
in 1897.[[74]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-74){#cha-74}

The writings of James and Dewey would point the way for the ""cultural
radicals,"" the pluralists of the near future, but the boldest signpost
was first erected by Du Bois when he asked rhetorically of the seventeen
attentive men in the Washington church:

\[W\]hat after all, am I? Am I an American or am I a Negro? Can I be
both? Or is it my duty to cease to be a Negro as soon as possible and be
an American? If I strive as a Negro, am I not perpetuating the very
cleft that threatens and separates black and white America? Is not my
only possible practical aim the subduction of all that is Negro in me to
the American? Does my black blood place upon me any more obligation to
assert my nationality than German, or Irish or Italian blood
would?[[75]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-75){#cha-75}

Frederick Douglass had gone to the grave pleading that, whenever and
wherever practicable, African-Americans not form separate social and
political organizations. In ""our union is our weakness,"" he came to
believe; ""a nation within a nation is an anomaly. There can be but one
American nation.""[[76]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-76){#cha-76} It
was a debate that had raged for many years, even before the Civil War,
among those Negroes whose livelihoods and northern residency had
permitted it. The ringing answer offered by Du Bois before the academy
invested ancient sentiment with fresh language, and balanced parochial
pleading with sociological formulation. It apotheosized the concept of
racial ""twoness"" and hugely contributed to the permanence of the concept
in the collective mentality of a people. Beyond that, Du Bois
secularized the deep belief widespread among African-Americans in
heavenly deliverance from earthly troubles, declaring that salvation
came through history to races in tune with the Zeitgeist:

Here, it seems to me, is the reading of the riddle that puzzles so many
of us. We are Americans, not only by birth and by citizenship, but by
our political ideals, our language, our religion. Farther than that, our
Americanism does not go. At that point, we are Negroes, members of a
vast historic race that from the very dawn of creation has slept, but
half awakening in the dark forests of its African fatherland. We are the
first fruits of this new nation, the harbinger of that black tomorrow
which is yet destined to soften the whiteness of the Teutonic
today.[[77]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-77){#cha-77}

Replaying themes first heard in the Harvard graduation speech on
Jefferson Davis, Du Bois praised the nonacquisitiveness of
African-Americans, their special sensibilities in music, humor, and
imagination. He foresaw an indomitable march ahead for his people if
they combined and pooled resources in strong ""race organizations""---""our
one haven of refuge is ourselves."" But they needed clean havens, he said
in closing. The late-Victorian Zeitgeist abhorred filth. The first and
greatest step ""toward the settlement of the present friction between the
races,"" he said, echoing Crummell, ""lies in the correction of the
immorality, crime, and laziness among the Negroes themselves."" Du Bois
made it clear that he advocated not integration but parallel
development, ""side by side in peace and mutual happiness""; not social
equality but ""social equilibrium""---a goal that Booker Washington would
have roundly applauded had he been there. Not only did he catalogue the
races, Du Bois endowed each with special, if not unique,
characteristics, ascribing essentially ""soft"" or ""feminine"" qualities to
the African-American. Fundamentally different, races must above all
safeguard their distinctiveness. This was a law of history, and if,
""among the gaily-colored banners that deck the broad ramparts of
civilization is to hang one uncompromising black,"" the German-trained
scholar exhorted, ""then it must be placed there by black headsÂ ... and
hearts beating in one glad song of
jubilee.""[[78]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-78){#cha-78}

Issued by the academy later that year as a fifteen-page pamphlet, ""The
Conservation of Races"" was a magnificent assault weapon designed to lay
down a deadly field of fire against racists in general and Negrophobes
in particular. In the acclamation following delivery of the paper,
however, the speaker and most of his auditors failed to realize that
those who launched appeals of racial solidarity and racial purity were
using a boomerang for a weapon. A surprising dissent did come from the
diminutive divinity student William Ferris. He thought Du Bois had got
the picture upside down. Men were great not because of the races they
represented; races were great because they reflected the contributions
of outstanding
individuals.[[79]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-79){#cha-79}
Scarborough, too, wondered about the very peculiar situation of races
coexisting yet never amalgamating, and one or two other members probably
found the Hegelian nostrums a bit gassy. But when President Crummell
glided to the lectern to pronounce Du Bois's paper ""essentially a good
one,"" debate subsided.[[80]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-80){#cha-80}

Whatever type of ordnance it was, ""The Conservation of Races"" lobbed
some of the most powerful projectiles of racial and cultural exclusivism
onto the ideological landscape of the twentieth century; their
repercussions as black nationalism, black Zionism, Pan-Africanism, black
aestheticism, and isms yet to discharge in the next century, have caused
regimes to shudder and crumble and very probably will shake future ones
to their foundations.[[81]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-81){#cha-81}
And although Du Bois would later consider his academy paper to be a
youthful effusion that was something of an embarrassment as he strode
through the new century as slayer of racial doctrines, it would
represent one highly significant skein of his complex intellectual
makeup until the end of his
days.[[82]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-82){#cha-82} The raw racism
that a future generation of Germans and other Europeans would espouse in
the perverted names of Fichte, Hegel, Herder, de Gobineau, and Nietzsche
was a stupendous irony that awaited not only Du Bois but large numbers
of incredulous men and women whose intellectual maturity had come during
the ebb tide of Victorianism.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[THAT EVENING]{.epub-sc} in February 1896 when Du Bois celebrated his
twenty-eighth birthday, miserably, in his room in Shorter Hall, the
distance from Wilberforce to Berlin seemed to be measured in terms of
light-years rather than miles. ""This queer world"" had never puzzled him
more than today, he told the diary. The campus had been engulfed by a
paroxysm of religious fervor. Perhaps the frenzy served some purpose, he
continued, but ""yet do you know I've been a prisoner in my room for
nearly a week, driven almost to distraction by wild screams and groans
and shrieks that rise from the chapel below me...?"" He found himself in
a state of near ""mental
imbecility.""[[83]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-83){#cha-83} Until the
national attention that [The Suppression of the African Slave
Trade]{.epub-i} attracted at the beginning of 1897, his calvary at
Wilberforce had been relieved only by Crummell, thoughts of marriage,
two friendships, and the electricity discharged by Booker T.
Washington's speech in Atlanta, Georgia.

What Washington had said at the opening of the Cotton States
International Exposition on September 18, 1895, turned out to be one of
the most consequential pronouncements in American history. Neither black
people nor white people were ever quite the same again. His words had
been telegraphed to every major newspaper in the country. Southern
politicians and colonels had whooped and capered amid a savanna of
ladies' handkerchiefs when he finished. Editor Clark Howell of the
Atlanta [Constitution,]{.epub-i} arbitral voice of the New South, rushed
toward the speakers' platform to cry out, ""That man's speech is the
beginning of a moral revolution in America."" Arriving in Atlanta a few
days later, President Grover Cleveland had clasped the Tuskegee
principal's hand firmly and spoken of ""new hope"" for
Negroes.[[84]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-84){#cha-84} Equally
enthusiastic congratulations rained down on Washington from almost every
prominent African-American, including a telegram from a young
Wilberforce professor sent from Xenia on September 24: ""Let me heartily
congratulate you upon your phenomenal success at Atlanta---it was a word
fitly spoken."" Du Bois had followed it up with a letter to the New York
[Age]{.epub-i} saying that ""here might be the basis of a real settlement
between whites and blacks in the South, if the South opened to the
Negroes the doors of economic opportunity and the Negroes cooperated
with the white South in political
sympathy.""[[85]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-85){#cha-85}

The full meaning of the Atlanta Exposition speech was yet to unfold,
but, according to Louis Harlan, his careful biographer, Washington
clearly intended the crux of his speech to be the mutuality of racial
obligations in the Redeemed South. In exchange for black acceptance of
restrictions on the franchise and no further demands for ""social
equality,"" the South's white rulers were to allow gradual progress in
agriculture and business and to rein in the rednecks. His people in the
South, Washington said at Atlanta, were thirsty men and women aboard a
ship lost at sea, who should heed the voice crying, ""Cast down your
buckets where you are.... by making friends in every manly way of the
people of all races by whom we are
surrounded.""[[86]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-86){#cha-86} In return,
the white people must cast down their buckets also ""among these people
who have, without strikes and labor wars, tilled your fields, cleared
your forests, builded your railroads and cities."" Raising his brown
right hand, the educator illustrated a spellbinding image: ""In all
things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet
one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress."" Seldom in
history and homiletics have a metaphor and simile accomplished so much
as those in what was shortly called the ""Atlanta Compromise"" speech. As
Du Bois understood Washington's words, the proposed bargain was one that
he could fully approve.[[87]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-87){#cha-87}

Meanwhile, there were friendships in the Wilberforce gulag. Second
Lieutenant Charles Young and poet Paul Laurence Dunbar were as
dissimilar physically and professionally as they were similar in terms
of artistic temperament and interests. The tubercular young poet had
operated an elevator in a downtown Dayton building to support himself
and his mother until his first success at the beginning of 1893, [Oak
and Ivy,]{.epub-i} his first collection of poems. When he came over from
Dayton for a reading sometime during Du Bois's second year, Dunbar's
star was rising. [Majors and Minors]{.epub-i} reached the public early
in 1896. ""Minors"" referred to his Negro dialect poems, but his standard
English ""majors"" (modeled after the Hoosier verse of James Whitcomb
Riley) went unappreciated. He would be overwhelmed and finally
disillusioned by the popularity of his dialect poetry. In [Harper's
Weekly]{.epub-i} the next year, William Dean Howells dubbed him ""the
only man of pure African blood and of American civilization to feel the
negro life aesthetically and express it
lyrically.""[[88]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-88){#cha-88} By
contrast, Du Bois was amazed to see that Dunbar, whose work he had
supposed to be that of a gifted white man, was a soft-spoken
African-American.[[89]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-89){#cha-89}
Dunbar's even more popular [Lyrics of Lowly Life]{.epub-i} came out in
1897. A friendship developed that would be renewed in the American Negro
Academy and last until the poet's alcohol-wracked death nine years
later.

Dunbar's physical opposite, thirty-one-year-old Charles Young was five
feet eight inches of granite. A spit-and-polish officer with service in
the army's hard-riding 9th Cavalry in Nebraska and recognized as an
outstanding cartographer, Young was a study in remarkable willpower and
self-control. A backwoods Kentuckian whose slave parents had brought him
to southern Ohio after the Civil War, he had needed the full measure of
such qualities in order to survive West Point as its ninth
African-American appointee and third graduate. Young was trim,
brown-skinned, low-keyed, gifted in languages and music, and was even
grudgingly admired by an occasional white officer. He read widely, wrote
clearly, and since 1894 had been on assignment with the War Department
as a professor of tactics and military science at Wilberforce, where he
also taught French and mathematics. Young lived near the campus with his
mother, and Du Bois sometimes escaped from campus conniptions to enjoy a
musical evening with them. ""He and I both refused to attend the annual
'revivals' which interrupted school work every year at Christmas time,""
recalled Du Bois.[[90]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-90){#cha-90}
Christmas of '96, especially, the Youngs and Du Bois and several others
would have something special to celebrate: Young was promoted to first
lieutenant. Young's was the first genuine male friendship in Du Bois's
life, one of a handful in which there was genuine affinity. Twenty years
after leaving Wilberforce, he would lead a fight for Young's
professional life that was one of the most cruel ever to engage him.

Friendship with the Youngs nearly turned out to be a boon in a rather
curious encounter, as well. For some time now Albert Hart had
contemplated Du Bois's predicament at Wilberforce with impatient dismay.
Finally, at the end of 1895, he practically ordered his prize student to
write Booker Washington about his plight. Du Bois did so early that
January; explaining that it was Hart's idea, he complained that he was
not ""wholly satisfied and am continually on the lookout for another
position.""[[91]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-91){#cha-91} On April
Fools' Day, Du Bois wrote again, presumably responding to an encouraging
message. He felt that he ""should like to work at Tuskegee if \[he\]
could be of service"" to Washington. He proposed the gradual buildup of a
school of Negro history and social investigation. In any case, he was
""willing and eager to entertain any proposition for giving service"" to
Tuskegee. The more he considered the prospect, the more it must have
appealed to him, because five days later he invited the Tuskegee
principal to be his personal guest when he visited the campus that June.
Unfortunately, Du Bois added, he couldn't offer accommodations himself,
but his friends the Youngs also wished Washington to be ""their and my
guest at their
residence.""[[92]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-92){#cha-92} The sources
are silent on what would have been their first face-to-face meeting---an
indication that it probably never came to pass after all. Still, both
men had taken their first steps toward one another, and Hart, one of
Tuskegee Institute's influential northern boosters, was determined to
steer them into a professional embrace.

It may have been the desolation of Du Bois's inner life at Wilberforce
that drove him into a more personal embrace at this time. He was
""quickly losing faith in the value of the way won. What business had I,
anyhow, to teach Greek,"" he agonized, ""when I had studied men?"" He saw
now that in going there he ""had made a
mistake.""[[93]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-93){#cha-93} Suddenly, he
found himself in a row with Bishop Arnett that shook the campus. Du Bois
had been drilling students for roles in [A Midsummer Night's
Dream]{.epub-i} with the gusto and fussiness of a great director. It was
to be performed in a pastoral ravine dividing the ""church side"" from the
""state side"" of Wilberforce's two campuses, where the gentle waters of
Tawawa Springs still ran. But the production was promptly abandoned when
the bishop summarily appointed one of his incompetent sons professor of
literature. Du Bois led faculty and students on strike. To their
surprise, they won. Ben Arnett III stepped down, but Du Bois realized
that the victory was a pyrrhic
one.[[94]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-94){#cha-94} William McKinley's
favorite advisor on Negro affairs was not to be trifled with. Misery in
work, the appearance of an attractive, caring woman, and a victory for
academic standards in a lost war---these are familiar breeding grounds
for dramatic, fateful personal decisions. And, after all, Du Bois had
recently ""carefully calculated"" that he should marry before age thirty,
and that his salary of eight hundred dollars should be sufficient for
two---""if paid.""[[95]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-95){#cha-95}

Nina Gomer was one of three surviving children born to Charles Gomer, a
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, hotel chef, and his deceased Alsatian wife. She was
not sophisticated, but she had excellent manners and was well spoken.
She was Du Bois's student. Very likely, given her heritage and her
lifelong fondness for the language and the country, she would have taken
French from Charles Young. ""A slip of a girl,"" [Darkwater]{.epub-i} says
of her, ""beautifully dark-eyed and thorough and good as a German
housewife."" Adopting the Germanic usage of those days, Du Bois would
often refer to her simply as
""wife.""[[96]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-96){#cha-96} She had
lustrous black hair, large, lovely, trusting eyes, and an hourglass
figure. Her complexion was lighter than her future husband's but not so
light as to appear white, although she could easily have been mistaken
for a South American or even a southern Italian. She was popular with
classmates, and she had a natural delicacy that other women tended to
envy. Her friend Pearl Shorter ""idolized Miss Nina Gomer"" and thought
she was ""a sort of pattern"" to be followed in her own
life.[[97]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-97){#cha-97} When Will (Nina
would always call him that) came to the little prenuptial party held on
the campus tennis court---the only male present---he charmed the
celebrants by teaching them the game of gossip. Pearl Shorter was
convinced that Nina and her fiancÃ© were admirably matched. The next day,
the happy bride-to-be took a train from Xenia for Cedar Rapids. Du Bois
was to follow in a few days, with his year-end salary in hand. There was
a heart-stopping moment's difficulty about the pay, when the university
treasurer told him that salaries would be paid only after the AME
Church's annual general conference. ""Penniless and my brideÂ ... awaiting
me in Iowa,"" Du Bois collared this worthy and, as the
[Autobiography]{.epub-i} delicately put it, ""firmly persuaded him that
until my salary due was paid, he was unlikely to see General
Conference.""[[98]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-98){#cha-98}

Du Bois rushed to Cedar Rapids to be married on a Tuesday, May 12, 1896.
In the blurred rush, he recalled a white cottage, the tall, heavy father
and his young second wife, a ""shy fat little sister,"" a kindly white
minister, and the return trip the next day to two furnished rooms in the
men's dormitory. A ""gorgeous crimson couch cover"" awaited the newlyweds,
a mail-order purchase made by the groom from Carson-Pirie in Chicago. As
Pearl Shorter remembered it, the bridal reception a day or so later was
even something of a fashion show. She simply delighted ""in each gown and
hat she wore, and in the happiness of you both---Happy
yesterdays!""[[99]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-99){#cha-99} Three
weeks later, a telegram came from the University of Pennsylvania
promising release from Wilberforce: ""Are ready to appoint you for one
year at nine hundred dollars maximum payable monthly from date of
service. If you wish appointment will write
definitely.""[[100]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter7-100){#cha-100} The
message bore the signature of C. C. Harrison, acting provost.

T[HE]{.epub-sc} A[GE OF]{.epub-sc} M[IRACLES]{.epub-sc}

[""At but not of Harvard""]{.epub-bi}

D[U BOIS'S MOOD]{.epub-sc}---W.E.B. Du Bois's mood (Willie is no
more)---ran to euphoria during the next twelve years, and never more so
than in the fall of 1888 on his way to Harvard. Repeatedly, those years
would be recaptured and revised in fine-tuned memoirs that expertly
combined truth with license: [Darkwater]{.epub-i} (1920); ""A Pageant in
Seven Decades: 1868--1938"" (1938); [Dusk of Dawn]{.epub-i} (1940); and
the [Autobiography]{.epub-i} (1968). Life was promising, exhilarating.
Obstacles existed merely to test his mettle and be overcome. ""I willed
and lo! I was walking beneath the elms of Harvard---the name of
allurement, the college of my youngest, wildest visions. I needed money,
scholarships and prizes fell into my lap."" When, within the full, quick,
first Harvard year, nostalgic letters came from Fisk classmates telling
of disappointments in love and career, he gently chided them for their
""more or less unconscious mocking of the world,"" commending to them the
remedy of ""all-absorbing life work."" He found bitterness unworthy, for
now he loved ""the great throbbing heart of the world"" as he never loved
it before. In [Darkwater]{.epub-i} (so furious at the world yet so
pleased with himself), Du Bois cakewalks through Harvard in a single
paragraph of breathless compression. ""Commencement came and standing
before governor, president, and grave, gowned men,"" he is a comet
flashing on to glory but not before telling them ""certain astonishing
truths, waving my arms and breathing fast!"" Without ""thought of modest
hesitation"" he forces a supercilious philanthropy headed by a former
president of the United States to capitulate before his onslaught for a
fellowship, then sails confidently for
Europe.[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-1){#cha-1}

Later, as his rage with American apartheid evolved into what many saw as
racial chauvinism and then into a special brand of Marxism, Du Bois
wrote divergent scripts for his Harvard incarnations. The Grateful
Outsider yielded center stage to the Imperial Self, with shadings of
given details subtly manipulated until autobiographical discordances
tend to pass unnoticed. As the Grateful Outsider, he ""asked nothing of
Harvard but the tutelage of teachers and the freedom of the library."" If
most of his white classmates were merely civil in the lecture hall and
unaware of his very existence in the Yard, the loss was theirs; he had
his ""'island within' and it was fair country."" If the glee club rejected
a rare attempt to join in the social life of the college and to share
his fine singing voice, ultimately it meant little because he was a
prized member of Boston's vital African-American community. If he sang
the college song, it was merely because he ""liked the music, and not
from any pride in the Pilgrims."" He was, he said, ""in Harvard but not of
it,"" yet he made certain to make an impression on his professors
sufficient to merit welcome among them in the august Philosophical
Club.[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-2){#cha-2}

The Imperial Self was less impressed by his Harvard world. The
possibility that his social conduct had been governed by an ""inferiority
complex"" (conceded in [Dusk of Dawn]{.epub-i}) was dismissed in the
[Autobiography]{.epub-i} as having nothing to do with ""unhappiness or
resentment."" He had simply been exceptional among African-Americans of
his generation in embracing ""voluntary race segregation,"" although he
approved of geology professor Nathaniel Southgate Shaler's classroom
expulsion of a white southerner who objected to sitting next to
him.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-3){#cha-3} Ruminating in the
[Massachusetts Review]{.epub-i} at ninety-two, Du Bois remembered
Harvard as an endured experience charged with frivolity, snobbishness,
and conservatism---merely adequate to the intellectual needs of a
sojourner preoccupied with the predestined part he was to play in the
larger world. Grades meant less than knowledge. No ""'snap'"" courses for
him; he was there ""to enlarge my grasp of the meaning of the universe.""
""Of course, \[he\] wanted friends,"" but because of his uncompromising
racial philosophy, he ""could not seek
them.""[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-4){#cha-4} Despite his
self-imposed segregation and boilerplate ""brusquerie,"" he joined the
Foxcraft Club, was a Philosophical Club regular, and even allowed
himself to notice a few classmates destined to cut large swaths beyond
Harvard---Herbert Croly, Augustus Hand, Robert Herrick, and two or three
others. He recalled reading Kant's [Critique of Pure Reason]{.epub-i}
with George Santayana in the philosopher's rooms, and William James was
a social friend who gave Du Bois advice about a career. All in all the
place was useful, and Du Bois departed Cambridge of the opinion that he
""did not find better teachers at Harvard, but teachers better known""
than at Fisk.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-5){#cha-5}

But the road to and through Harvard was not so easy in reality. Getting
there, surviving its Anglo-Saxon Protestant environment in which
Catholics and Jews were condescended to almost as much as
African-Americans, winning its academic prizes, and graduating cum laude
was not the snap Du Bois made it out to
be.[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-6){#cha-6} It detracts not at all
from his unique intelligence and nobly defined goals to rewrite the
Harvard years in less-inflated prose, to winch Du Bois down from a
pedestal of successive triumphs onto the bed of his own contingent and
very human success story. It was a story he discarded in the interests
of constructing the myth of the Imperial Self that he believed his
people needed in order to take themselves as seriously as he took
himself. This was his ego's learning decade, the ten or more years when
the life and destiny of Africans in America merged inseparably with his
own. But the transformation, though remarkably quick and thorough,
proceeded unevenly, and, occasionally, even faltered. It took Du Bois
time and considerable effort to become himself.

Despite the dreams revealed in the [Herald]{.epub-i} and the seemingly
providential good fortune reported in the memoirs, his future after Fisk
had been anything but assured. Curiously enough, the academic standards
at Harvard and Fisk may not have been as incommensurable as it might
seem reasonable to suppose today, given the imported Ivy League
faculties and the minuscule social class from which the southern liberal
arts colleges recruited their best students. Still, for a young
African-American even of Du Bois's manifest brilliance to pass from a
two-decades-old missionary school to the 252-year-old empyrean of white
collegiate training in America was an extraordinary ascension. As part
of President Charles W. Eliot's ongoing plan to transform what had been
a diploma-granting club for New England and, particularly, Back Bay
scions into a university where national leadership in all the
professions was forged, Harvard began opening its doors to exceptional
male representatives of immigrant groups, as well as a few
African-Americans. President Eliot's inaugural address had expressed the
view that ""only after generations of civil freedom and social equality""
would the intellectual capacities of women for higher education be
determined. Harvard was ready, however, to risk admitting even the
poorest men, ""provided that with their povertyÂ ... they bring capacity,
ambition and purity."" Richard T. Greener, who was to spend his
foreign-service career languishing in Vladivostok, had been the first of
the African-Americans, graduating from Harvard College in
1870.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-7){#cha-7} Wagering that
Eliot's enlightened admission policy made his educational ambitions
realizable, Du Bois had declined President Cravath's offer of a
scholarship to Hartford Theological Seminary and written to Harvard in
October 1887.[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-8){#cha-8}

Harvard and Yale traditionally required African-American baccalaureates
to repeat a portion of their undergraduate training, a requirement
frequently imposed on white graduates of undistinguished colleges. Money
was a problem; probably he couldn't raise more than \$150 a year. What
did Harvard suggest he do about it? his letter of inquiry asked. Across
the top of this straightforward appeal, Secretary Frank Bolles penned
the suggestion that Du Bois might apply for a Price Greenleaf stipend,
""if strongly recommended by faculty of Fisk."" In addition to the strong
Fisk recommendations, Frank Hosmer underscored that the applicant was
destined for important service, ""one of those who should be assisted in
obtaining a thorough preparation for his work."" Uncle James Burghardt
wrote in trembling hand to certify that his nephew was ""unable of
himself, or with such aid as I can give him, to meet his necessary
expenses at Harvard College."" Two hundred fifty dollars in Price
Greenleaf support still left Du Bois short by at least an equal
amount.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-9){#cha-9} A chance
conversation with a student in the Fisk Preparatory School, one Fortson,
raised the possibility of summer work waiting tables in a Minnesota
resort hotel. Fortson thought that he, Du Bois, T. J. McClellan, his
Livingstone Hall roommate, Du Bois's friend Tom Calloway, and perhaps
two others from Fisk could save enough from tips to pay a good portion
of their expenses the following year. After two summers' work there,
Fortson had reached the impressive rank of second
waiter.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-10){#cha-10}

The significance of the stint at Lake Minnetonka lay not so much in the
money Du Bois and his companions netted that summer, although had he
headed east without part of it, he might well have had to postpone life
in Cambridge for another year. But the experience would have been of
passing significance were it not that, once again with Du Bois, the
incidental or routine was freighted with dramatic personal and racial
meaning. As he recounted the Lake Minnetonka period, drunken vulgarity
abounded---corpulent, red-faced businessmen and a good number of
sporting-crowd types caromed the hallways with easy women---and hotel
patrons treated the staff like faceless peons, while, in retaliation,
the staff creamed off the best food for itself. In that world of
servility, Du Bois grandly declared, he declined to be more than an
uncorrupted observer. He made no tips at Lake Minnetonka. Rudely
summoned to a table once, he left the astonished diner waiting with hand
raised. For all Du Bois knew, ""he may be beckoning
yet.""[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-11){#cha-11} Du Bois claimed
that, according to their original plan, he left the hotel at the end of
the season to drum up singing concerts for Fortson and the others in
Minneapolis, St. Paul, Madison, Milwaukee, and Chicago, an undertaking
sharply testing his mother wit and diplomacy but one that succeeded in
the end in earning money. Finally, Minnetonka had been ""on the whole a
rather disillusioning
experience.""[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-12){#cha-12}

The memoirs tinker with the Lake Minnetonka summer: they had never
intended to be waiters because of inexperience, only busboys; the others
had waited tables, but he ""could not or would not learn""; the glee-club
gambit, with himself as advance agent---""executive planner""---had been
stage two of a well-thought-out
plan.[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-13){#cha-13} But when he wrote
a detailed circular letter the following year to Fisk classmates (who
would have learned from the others about the graduation summer), he said
""work at Lake Minnetonka was pleasant,"" that he had found time to read
Longfellow's ""Hiawatha,"" ""fancying that the 'Githchie Gumee' lay before
me."" Du Bois, who was justly proud of his voice, revealed that he had
joined Calloway, McClellan, and the others in regular hotel parlor
concerts ""which sometimes netted and sometimes didn't."" If he never got
tips waiting table, it may well have been more because of inexperience
than disdain of serving. Finally, the advance-agent ""plan"" is revealed
to have been desperate improvisation after the management ""startled""
Fortson's recruits with the August warning that, due to slow business,
the hotel would close early. And if Du Bois then ""seemed the most
available advance agent,"" it was probably because, useless in the dining
room, his fellows urged the role upon
him.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-14){#cha-14} Without the
revealing Fisk circular letter, the Lake Minnetonka summer would remain
as Du Bois presented it in his published writings, a financial exigency
in which his abilities ultimately saved the day. Whatever the truth of
that summer experience, his presentation effectively screens from us the
finesse with which he retouched the quotidian details of life in order
to produce the desired image of impregnable racial pride.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[IT WAS]{.epub-sc} a rainy September day when Du Bois arrived in
Cambridge with less than the fifty dollars he had started off with. (At
Syracuse, New York, a young con man had boarded the train and, after a
rapid exchange of bills, a sleepy, chagrined Du Bois had been left ten
dollars poorer.) Reporting to the bursar, he was dumbfounded to learn
that the Price Greenleaf fellowship money would not be available until
later in the semester. The thirty dollars outstanding from the glee
clubbers (""the boodle,"" he called it) was a. few weeks away from being
remitted, and meanwhile Harvard required a partial tuition payment up
front. He managed to borrow seventy-five dollars but failed to find
someone in Boston who would stand him to the four-hundred-dollar loan he
needed to cover the semester's expenses. His slim cash reserves dwindled
a few more precious dollars each day. Was it Frank Hosmer and the
Congregationalists of Great Barrington who saved him with a loan
requiring of him no security?
Probably.[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-15){#cha-15} Help also
came from his Cambridge landlady, Mrs. Mary Taylor, who allowed him to
owe the rent. John and Mary Taylor, solid working-class people, were
African-Americans originally from Nova Scotia, whose two-story frame
house, still standing a century later, at 20 Flagg Street a few blocks
from the Yard, was home to Du Bois during his four years of
undergraduate and graduate
study.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-16){#cha-16} He took his
meals at Memorial Hall, the large dining facility where students of
moderate means boarded. That first year was, he said in the circular
letter, the ""tightest place"" of his life.

But he was in, with 281 others of the class of '90---only the sixth
African-American admitted to the college since Richard
Greener.[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-17){#cha-17} Many of those
who matriculated at Harvard during the closing years of the nineteenth
century looked back on those days as a golden age. By Du Bois's time,
the increasingly unfettered system of course electives---President
Eliot's gamble---was a widely acclaimed, proven curriculum, immensely
popular with undergraduates. The philosophy of growth through choice had
even extended to spiritual matters in 1886, when compulsory daily chapel
attendance was abolished. The threat of a national university being
established in Washington now fifteen years behind it, Harvard
monopolized the role, increasingly matching a varied student body to a
varied curriculum. ""The poorest and the richest students are equally
welcome here,"" the reforming president boasted. If membership in the
Dickie, Fly, or Porcellian clubs mattered greatly to many of his
classmates, and if Cabots, Endicotts, Mathers, and Wentworths passed him
under the elms, Du Bois's own presence and that of Clement Garnett
Morgan, the other African-American in his class, underscored the
college's steady enrollment of men who were neither Brahmins nor prized
solely because of family wealth. Du Bois had arrived never even having
heard of Phi Beta Kappa, ""and of such important social organizations as
the Hasty Pudding Club, \[he\] knew
nothing.""[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-18){#cha-18}

Hutchins Hapgood from Chicago ('92) was typical of this newer generation
of students who affected complete indifference to membership in
exclusive clubs, an attitude fully shared by his old-line Boston
classmate, Robert Morss Lovett, who believed that most undergraduates
""were unconcerned with it."" They shared the tonic sentiment that, as
Lovett crooned, ""this period was a golden age in the history of
Harvard,"" that, as Hapgood's brother Norman crooned, ""if there could be
a place intellectually more attractive,"" his imagination could not
formulate it. All of which agreed with Du Bois's own age-of-miracles
euphoria. Haughty Oswald Garrison Villard, class of '93, the
European-educated son of one of America's richest families and grandson
of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, said pithily that Harvard was
""entirely satisfied with itself. It had reason to
be.""[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-19){#cha-19} Villard himself
was headed for a history degree and graduate work under Albert Bushnell
Hart, ownership of a major newspaper, and a lifetime of civil
misunderstandings with upperclassman Du Bois.

Although Du Bois was later among those who, like Henry Brooks Adams,
George Santayana, and the sociologist Robert Ezra Park, argued
persuasively that Harvard was too satisfied with itself, he and they
praised the faculty.[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-20){#cha-20}
Professor Nathaniel Shaler's introduction to geology (Natural History 4)
was steadily popular, apparently because the Kentucky-bred scientist's
vast learning overflowed the narrows of his discipline and swept
students into much of the knowledge of the cosmos. Old Professor Francis
James Child's English department acquired bespatted, cane-twirling, and
entertainingly eccentric Barrett Wendell in 1880, a founder in his
college days of the [Harvard Lampoon]{.epub-i} and future author of [A
Literary History of America.]{.epub-i} There were Harvard men, Du Bois
among them, who recounted well into dotage the rites and rigors of
Wendell's English 12, in which enrollments sometimes reached two
hundred.[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-21){#cha-21} Hardly a year
passed during the 1880s but that President Eliot approved an appointment
that would achieve legendary or near-legendary proportions. The year Du
Bois came, Child brought George Lyman Kittredge, his prize student, then
teaching at Exeter Academy, into the department, where his scholarship
became the national touchstone for the study of Shakespeare. The field
of fine arts was presided over by the scholarship of the exquisite
Charles Eliot Norton.

The economics department, where Charles Francis Dunbar tended the votive
candles to laissez-faire and free trade, would evoke Du Bois's
dismissive comments in later years about ""dying Ricardian economics,""
but the bedrock course, Political Economy 1, under recently arrived
Frank William Taussig, never admitted a moment's doubt in the minds of
students about the immutable laws of free enterprise. ""Stinker""
Taussig's 1911 textbook, [Principles of Economics,]{.epub-i} would put a
high gloss on the rough and ready practices of the nation's business and
financial elites, becoming the canon for almost a
generation.[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-22){#cha-22} Sociology
was still a novel import (the enormously influential William Graham
Sumner had taught the first course in it at Yale), and Harvard would
eventually lag behind the new University of Chicago, then two years away
from creation, and Columbia for a number of
years.[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-23){#cha-23} Even so, under
kindly Francis Greenwood Peabody, Plummer Professor of Christian Morals,
Harvard men were prodded to consider what the social classes owed each
other and what the causes and social implications of extreme wealth and
poverty were. For Du Bois, whose admiration for Peabody would be
helpfully reciprocated years afterward, such concerns were hardly the
curious mental excursions most classmates found them. If Oswald Villard
wrote his father that Harvard was ""like sitting in a club window and
watching the world go by,"" Du Bois expected much more in the way of
real-world knowledge from the science of economics. Yet even he remained
too much the convert of Bismarckian statecraft and Carlylian willpower
to be inclined to draw radical conclusions about inequities in the
""Triumphant Democracy"" just then being gloriously described by Andrew
Carnegie. ""What the white world was doing, its goals and ideals,"" he
criticized as deficient only in the degree to which they excluded people
like himself.[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-24){#cha-24}

History, the department in which he would eventually take his advanced
degrees, impressed him as distinguished but somewhat dull. Herbert
Croly, Du Bois's classmate who was in and out of Harvard over a
fourteen-year period before being awarded a bachelor's, found, as did
Robert Lovett and others, that professors Edward Perkins Channing and
Silas Mac Vane covered material easily found in the textbooks. The
short, round, smooth-shaven Channing's course in early American
institutions ticked along year after year while his near-genius was to
flower only much later, yielding the prodigious six-volume [History of
the United States (1905--25).]{.epub-i} Mac Vane's History 2,
Constitutional Government in England and America, was now a husk of what
it had been under the opinionated originality of Henry Adams. Its newest
member, Albert Hart, would catapult the department into the twentieth
century but was just then introducing his close-reading techniques of
original documents in U. S. history, which Du Bois found, despite Hart's
dryness, more and more
interesting.[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-25){#cha-25} But none
of the other departments and no other professor interested him more than
philosophy and William James.

For Harvard men drawn to the humanities, the philosophy department
usually proved irresistible. Sociology might flourish incomparably at
Chicago, schools of history develop national sway at Johns Hopkins and
Columbia, but Harvard remained synonymous with philosophy until the
Great War, the cradle and preceptor of its American incarnation.
Harvard's senior light, Francis Bowen, Alford Professor of Natural
Religion, Moral Philosophy and Civil Polity, now a year from retiring,
had mentored Chauncey Wright, Charles Sanders Peirce, George Herbert
Palmer, and William James himself, the latter two well embarked upon
their legendary teaching careers when Du Bois
arrived.[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-26){#cha-26} The delicate,
hirsute Palmer, whose recent courtship of the president of Wellesley had
given innocent spice to gossip in the Yard, was an engrossing classroom
lecturer with more of a Platonic bias than a coherent philosophy.
Philosophy 4, his always heavily subscribed, two-semester course,
inaugurated what Palmer called ""self-realization ethics,"" broad-gauge
inquiry, independent of theology, into the means of approaching the
ideal in personal and social conduct. For Palmer, Harvard's elective
system was but the latest refinement in mankind's everlasting experiment
in self-realization. ""Our Father in Heaven had been using the elective
system long before we discovered it,"" he reminded college
men.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-27){#cha-27}

William James was an altogether different phenomenon. All energy in a
well-built frame, a somewhat disorganized lecturer, he was notably
available for advice and brainstorming, even for that era when
professional solicitude toward students was the natural relationship,
rather than the sometimes unavoidable one of later generations. His
Logic and Psychology course played to packed lecture halls, with James
encouraging fascinated students to talk him through proofs of the
existence of the Deity, to argue over the nature of sensations and
consciousness, the need for practical personal and social solutions
(""live options""), the optimal balance between science and faith---all of
it soon leading to the groundbreaking [Principles of
Psychology]{.epub-i} (1890) and [The Will to Believe]{.epub-i} (1897).
The empirical and psychological essentials of the Jamesian philosophy
were already unmistakable, although the term ""pragmatism"" was a few
years away from general currency. It was a lumping of philosophical
temperaments into ""tough-minded"" and ""tender-minded"" categories, the
testing of the ""cash value"" of ideas by demanding to know what concrete
difference their being true makes in the real world, and an insistence
that society must accommodate the plural, unsettling, competing
interests of individuals (""Individualism is
fundamental"").[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-28){#cha-28} For
James, arguments for the existence of God and the pursuit of ethics
depended in the final analysis not on logic or evidence but on belief.
""The question of having moral beliefs at all or not having them,"" he
asserted, ""is decided by our will."" But it was the man, as much as the
ideas, that made James's discipline much more appealing to Du Bois than
the area of political science in which he had intended to concentrate.

The philosophy department's other monument (the ""John L. Sullivan of
philosophy,"" a student called him) was Josiah Royce from the mining town
of Grass Valley, California, such an odd-looking man, with bowling-pin
torso and pointed head fringed with red hair, that Mrs. Royce would
startle Du Bois speechless at a student reception with the aside,
""'Funny-looking man, isn't
he?'""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-29){#cha-29} Royce was the
academy's pillar of Philosophical Idealism, as certain of his
ontological proof of the existence of the Absolute and of the grounding
of morals in reciprocity as James was conditional and experimental in
his ethical and theological beliefs. ""All reality,"" [The Religious
Aspect of Philosophy]{.epub-i} (1885) affirmed, ""must be present to the
Unity of Infinite Thought."" Summing up the argument with apposite
metaphor, one modern academic critic wrote that Royce's ""Absolute is the
melody, we are the notes."" Depression and insomnia in the wake of
completing [The Religious Aspect of Philosophy,]{.epub-i} followed by a
major history of California, along with a forgettable novel about that
state, required Royce to take leave during the spring of 1888 for a
cruise to Australia. He returned in time for Du Bois's first semester,
""as fresh as a new born babe,"" James said.

Du Bois wrote of Royce's influence in general rather than specific or
personal terms because his actual course work and contact with the
philosopher must have been minimal. Perhaps the muted influence had
something to do with the fact that Royce was a disaster in his dealings
with students outside the classroom. Absorbed in Olympian
contemplations, rolling out of his house with Mrs. Royce hurrying behind
waving his clip-on tie, the future professor of History of Philosophy
was usually incapable of holding an informal conversation. He knew so
much about the Absolute, Santayana wickedly said, ""that he has forgotten
what individual consciousness is like."" In terms of intellectual
temperament, though, Royce's Hegelianism, with its insistence upon
Absolute Truth behind the universe, the evolving unity of mankind, the
Kantian certainty that humanity sensed the need to be loyal to the
highest morals, and even his vague concern about race relations might
have seemed to have had irresistible appeal for Du Bois---more so than
Jamesian pragmatism.[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-30){#cha-30}

As Royce receded for Du Bois, Santayana stepped forward. Santayana had
lived with his Boston Sturgis mother during his undergraduate years,
spending summers in Spain with his reclusive father, a former governor
in the Spanish Philippines who had retired to Avila. A founder of the
[Lampoon]{.epub-i} and the [Harvard Monthly,]{.epub-i} Santayana had
graduated Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude in 1886. In September 1888,
encouraged by James, he returned to Cambridge from European graduate
studies to complete his doctorate, entering the philosophy department as
instructor the following year. President Eliot's espousal of academic
electives by no means extended to elective sex, and he brooded over the
possibility that James's Spanish-born recruit was ""abnormal.""
Santayana's senior colleague, Palmer, worried more about his teaching,
which he thought to be lacking in the young philosopher's first years.
It was Santayana's hint of decadence and his disengaged and stylish
approach that won students. The affectation of indifference was much in
vogue among men of the college, and the cold, brilliant, skeptical young
instructor with a ""curious Latin beauty about him physically"" (he was
not yet bald when Hutchins Hapgood first saw him) excited interest,
loyalty, and the titillating, cerebral homoeroticism often just below
the surface in all-male
environments.[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-31){#cha-31} Max
Eastman found him ""dangerously fascinating."" Santayana's empiricism was
of the radical kind, in which an idea was no more true than a sensation
was demonstrably real---beyond the undeniable fact that they were both
the stuff of conscious existence.

This was not how Du Bois saw philosophy. However shaken in his religious
faith and skeptical of moral abstractions, he was an idealist by
temperament, always believing that it was possible, somehow, to get from
the world's welter---observed phenomena---to the bedrock of
principles---upper-case Truth. Once again, philosophical principles were
less important in the instructor-student bond than the personality of
the philosopher. Well connected socially, but not an authentic Puritan,
the snobbish, swarthy Santayana, though infinitely more at home in the
Cambridge milieu than it was possible for Du Bois to be, was still
subtly, slightly an outsider. Royce was the peerless authority on Kant,
but when Du Bois and Santayana read the [Critique of Pure
Reason]{.epub-i} together (""he and I alone, in an upper room"") as
undergraduate and graduate scholars, the undergraduate's lifelong memory
of that experience may have been enhanced by a fleeting moment when each
man recognized in the other something of his own anomalous
situation.[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-32){#cha-32} Du Bois,
along with Croly, the Hapgoods, and Lovett, took the first courses
taught by Santayana. Over the next decade or so, they would be followed
by Bronson Cutting, Witter Bynner, T. S. Eliot, Conrad Aiken, Max
Eastman, Van Wyck Brooks, Robert Frost, and Alain
Locke.[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-33){#cha-33}

A euphoric confidence made Du Bois remarkably casual about competing
with classmates who had already absorbed two years of Harvard. He
""burned no midnight oil,"" he wrote. Instead, he followed a precise
routine of work that would have impressed Kant. Harvard residence halls
in Du Bois's day had no running water; Hemenway Gymnasium was the place
to take a hot shower at the start of the day: ""Rising at 7:15 and
breakfast. Work from 8--12:30. Lunch. Work from 1--4. From 4--5 I go to
the gymnasium. 5--5:30 I take a breathing spell. 5:30--7, dinner and
daily paper. 7--10:30 study or lectures or social visits, etc."" This was
to be pretty much the itinerary for the remainder of his life, minus
trips to the gymnasium. It was a regimen that produced good results,
especially in the sciences, where he racked up A's in Chemistry 3, under
H. B. Hill; in Natural History 4a, a half-year laboratory course under
Harris; and in Natural History 8, under Shaler and Davis. The
second-semester course, Political Economy 9, Constitutional and Legal
History of England to the 16th Century, under Charles Gross, yielded an
A--, Du Bois's comprehensive, analytical, and very detailed ""Report on
the German Railway System"" signaling his rapidly maturing scholarly
prowess. His senior-year performance in History 13, Constitutional and
Political History of the United States, was superlative, earning a final
A+ from the demanding Albert
Hart.[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-34){#cha-34}

The weak spot in the first year, surprisingly, was English
composition---almost his ""Waterloo at Harvard."" He received the first
failing grade of his life on a paper (""I was aghast""). English C,
Forensics, under Messrs. Thompson and Baker, was the one compulsory
course still required of all degree candidates, the reasonable rationale
being that while they might elect their subjects, all Harvard men must
be able to write about them in the Queen's English. The sheer number of
Tuesday and Thursday assignments necessitated parceling the essays out
to any number of faculty members in and out of the department. The luck
of the draw put Du Bois's essay in the merciless hands of the
just-arrived George Kittredge, who exploded in ""Egad!""s at the top and
bottom of it, only simmering down to pen lengthier marginalia after
scolding the author for not writing ""upon regular forensic paper with
margins for comments.""[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-35){#cha-35}

The topic of the offending essay, which Du Bois mistakenly remembered as
a rebuttal of a magazine piece by an Alabama senator, was in fact a
nineteen-page cartwheeling counterattack upon Louisiana Senator James B.
Eustis's article in the October [Forum]{.epub-i} claiming that the
granting of the franchise to African-Americans had been a mistake. If
African-Americans were naturally inferior rather than historically
disadvantaged, then how explain, Du Bois asked, that the senator's
distant ancestors had ""preferred to squat in the caves and fens of
Northern Europe rather than to come out into the glorious noontide of
the most wonderful of the world's ages, since they had had 'equal
advantages with the \[Greek\] race'""? Not even the forceful reasoning
and apt historical parallels (evoking a surprised ""fine writing"" from
Kittredge on page five), could save this essay. Although his stirring
appeals to history and democracy foretold the themes of Du Bois's
several books about Africa (and Africa in the mind of Europe), what
Kittredge saw in that December 3 effort was E work---failure, and a just
admonition that ""By trying to put too much into one sentence, you
confuse your ideas."" The final C in English C, a two-semester course,
damaged his class ranking, but it also spurred Du Bois to do better in
English D under Thompson and Baker as a senior (a final B), and risk
Barrett Wendell's English 12 in his first year of graduate
studies.[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-36){#cha-36}

According to Du Bois, he was ""repeatedly a guest in the house of William
James."" There is circumstantial confirmation for the claim not only in a
vividly recalled trip the two of them made to Roxbury one day in 1892 to
visit the deaf-mute Helen Keller at the Perkins Institute for the Blind
but also in the exchange of letters after Du Bois left Harvard. James's
penchant for unusual personalities was well known to his colleagues,
later provoking from Palmer the mild censure that his cultivation of the
""underdog, and his insistence on keeping the door open for every species
of human experiment, sometimes brought James into alliance with causes
his social set looked on with disfavor."" Santayana, one of those exotic
personalities himself, spoke archly of James's fondness for ""lame ducks
and neglected possibilities."" In Du Bois's case, James might have been
particularly predisposed to befriend a young Negro from the Berkshires
because of his own brother's service as an officer with the 54th
Infantry Regiment, the famous black Massachusetts unit Wilky James had
fought with and survived at Fort
Wagner.[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-37){#cha-37} James was
indisputably Du Bois's passport to the Harvard Philosophical Club,
founded about 1878 and a collateral descendant of what had been in the
early 1870s probably the most fecund intellectual circle in the United
States, the amorphous Metaphysical Club.

The Philosophical Club, unlike the Metaphysical Club and its immediate
successors, was closed to amateurs outside the university, and so
reflected the growing professionalization of knowledge at the close of
the nineteenth century. The club kept no records, so, aside from a brief
note from James to Du Bois about a ""philosophical supper on Saturday,
Feb 14th,"" we have only Du Bois's claim that he was something of a
regular, (going ""very
methodically"").[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-38){#cha-38} But
even if only an occasional invitee, the impact upon a serious, socially
isolated undergraduate of philosophizing with Palmer, Royce, James, and
Santayana can be imagined. But James had a realistic opinion of the
value of philosophy as a livelihood---as a general rule, don't try it.
When he had advised Santayana as an undergraduate not to become a
philosopher, he probably did so as a test of commitment. This same
advice to Du Bois proved a turning point in a life. No man without
independent means, certainly not a man dedicating his life to
programmatic uplift of a disadvantaged race, should become a philosophy
professor, James told Du Bois in his senior year, advice Professor Chase
at Fisk had also volunteered. But until then, admiration for the ""keen
analysis of William James, Josiah Royce, and young George Santayana""
drew Du Bois deeper into what he eventually saw as the ""lovely but
sterile land of philosophic
speculation.""[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-39){#cha-39}

Du Bois was taken seriously (whatever neo-abolitionist motives were at
play) because he took the life of the mind so seriously. Harvard
professors were, as he keenly appreciated, ""glad to receive a serious
student, to whom extra-curricular activities were not of paramount
importance."" His philosophy professors recognized the exceptional depth
of his interest, his quest for truth and the ethics derived from it. At
Fisk, philosophy had essentially been presented as another way of
grappling with theological concerns---all Platonic ideals and
incontrovertible moral facts; reason was the handmaiden of revelation.
At Harvard, Du Bois began to understand the limitations of such
traditional philosophizing, as the distinctions and conflicts between
what James called ""tender-minded"" idealism (belief in absolutes) and
""tough-minded"" realism (reliance upon science) became much clearer. If
the gentle, pious Palmer had served as his initial conductor, Du Bois's
philosophical instruction would have resumed at the juncture where
Cravath and Spence had left it. Because Palmer was on sabbatical leave
during academic year 1888--89, however, Philosophy 4 was taught by
James, who hurried into the Yard from his New Hampshire summer retreat
having, he confessed to a friend, only begun ""systematic reading in that
line three weeks ago.""[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-40){#cha-40}

Using ""that dear old duffer"" James Martineau's [Types of Ethical
Theory]{.epub-i} as the textbook (Martineau was an English Unitarian who
searched for nonbiblical justification for belief in God), James's
lecture notes suggest a road map being drawn up as the conductor charged
freewheelingly into new, occasionally divergent,
directions.[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-41){#cha-41} On the one
hand, he marshaled his extensive knowledge of medicine and neurology to
show how much that was supposedly rational in reality sprang from
psychological and even physiological energies. No belief or act, he
said, was to be exempted from rigorous scientific scrutiny; nothing that
ran against the grain of practical implementation was to be accepted
solely on appeal to tradition or emotion. Yet, on the other hand, James
would come to assert the validity of religious experience and the
reality of God---the ""reality of the unseen""---on intuitive grounds that
without them men and women experience ""a sense that there is [something
wrong about us]{.epub-i} as we naturally stand."" Social Darwinism, with
its Spencerian ""laws"" of efficient, organic social integration through
the universal mechanism of ""survival of the fittest,"" was then ascendant
in philosophy. Partly in reaction to such cosmic dogma, as well as
reflecting his own muscular temperament, James celebrated freewheeling
willpower and real-world advantages as the ultimate sources and
sanctions of ethical conduct. In a famous parody of Spencer's arcane
definition of evolution, James said that evolution was ""a change from a
nohowish, untalkaboutable, all alikeness to a somehowish and in general
talkaboutable, not-all-alikeness by continuous stick-to-getherations and
something elsifications."" In its effort to mediate between the ""tender""
and the ""tough,"" Jamesian pragmatism was the very antithesis of system
and, to its critics, even of coherence. Santayana, who tracked his
senior colleague's arguments, respected his ""masculine directness, his
impressionistic perceptions"" but finally decided, waspishly, that James
""started without caring where he went. In fact, he got
nowhere.""[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-42){#cha-42}

Wherever James was heading, Du Bois's left-handed lecture notes indicate
that he gave clear instructions at the Philosophy 4 starting post that
first week. ""Man spontaneously [believes]{.epub-i} and spontaneously
[acts,]{.epub-i}"" he told the class. ""But as acts and beliefs multiply
they grow inconsistent. To escape [bellum omnium contra omnes]{.epub-i}
(the war of all against all), reasonable principles, fit for all to
agree upon, must be sought."" It was this search, according to James,
that constituted philosophy, with its two subdivisions of science (""the
principles of [fact]{.epub-i} or what [is,]{.epub-i} whether good or
bad"") and ethics (""what is good or bad, whether it be or be
not).""[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-43){#cha-43} The learned
President Cravath had certainly entertained no such experimental and
consensual view of moral philosophy; the novelty of James's approach was
enormously exciting. Du Bois confronted the ancient problem of
justifying what ought to be from what is, of finding a bridge between
the normative and the descriptive, with such laserlike intensity that he
must have hoped to pierce the conundrum in Gore Hall, the college's
uncrowded library, or in the upstairs room in Flagg Street. ""While I
think a Science of Ethics possible,"" one of his Philosophy 4 blue books
hypothesized, ""I cannot see the way to it
clearly.""[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-44){#cha-44}

By the end of the second semester, though, he believed he might be about
to crack one of philosophy's great perennials---justification of moral
conduct through empirical observation. The result was a fifty-two-page
handwritten essay, ""The Renaissance of Ethics: A Critical Comparison of
Scholastic and Modern Ethics."" Despite a few solecisms and much dense
writing, eliciting from James marginal comments such as ""obscurely put,""
and ""a little too compact to be clear,"" Du Bois's offering made a
favorable impression on his idol. As a history of ideas, the third-year
student's essay demonstrated enormous learning; as a treatise on ethics
dependent upon logical clarity, however, some portions of it are as
impenetrable as others are
engrossing.[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-45){#cha-45} The essay
audaciously dismissed modern metaphysics ""from Kant to Royce"" as no
better than that of the ""scientific"" Scholastics Peter Abelard and
William of Occam because, in becoming alienated from science, it had
abandoned the splendid goal of the unity of knowledge. But there was
error aplenty on the ""tough"" side, Du Bois continued. Having liberated
itself from metaphysics after the seventeenth century, science had
forged ahead via discovery and invention to make sense of the physical
realm, yet it had chosen to abjure the higher objective of the unity of
knowledge. The study of ethics had added to the confusion by becoming
decoupled from both metaphysics and science.

Du Bois proceeded to formulate a way out for James and himself. It was
through duty. The ""fundamental question of the Universe, for ages, past,
present, and to come"" involved duty, he contended. Not, however, the
duty of the [summum bonum,]{.epub-i} the highest good, ""as Scholastic
and most Moslem ethical philosophers would say."" Du Bois defined duty in
relativist terms as the obligation to know ""how much better is the best
that can be than the worst?"" eliciting ""Good! first rate!"" from
James.[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-46){#cha-46} ""The Renaissance
of Ethics"" asserted that ""the whole purpose of duty hangs upon the Cause
and Purpose of this great drama we call life,"" and to understand ""duty
we must know Ends."" But knowledge of ends brought Du Bois squarely up
against the dilemma that had led to the separation of metaphysics and
science in the first place. Put another way, the problem was simply the
logical impossibility of moving from the realm of matter (or what is) to
the realm of spirit (or what ought to be). Determined to make modern
ethics do a better job of guiding social and individual conduct, Du Bois
foundered in a large patch of conceptual yeast for several bewildering
pages. Emerging from his expository ordeal, he could do no better than
to lay down a rule that ""a man must have a life-work on the fulfilling
of which depends his hope of the life to come."" With James observing
""too oracular and ambiguous,"" and ""all becomes obscure here,"" Du Bois's
essay pressed doggedly onward: ""The fact that a science of ethics today
is not possible for lack of facts upon which to base it ought not to
hinder ethical conduct."" Ethical science will come slowly, fallibly, Du
Bois contended, if the ""cornerstone of the world structure,"" guided by
science, becomes ""first the what, then the why---underneath the
everlasting Ought.""[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-47){#cha-47}

Without yet realizing it, Du Bois, for all his admiration of William
James and his debt to him in the realm of ideas (""my friend and guide to
clear thinking""), showed in ""The Renaissance of Ethics"" that the wills
to believe of Du Bois and James diverged sharply. The instructor was
reconciled to making the best of things in a world of unprovable
ultimates. The student was unwilling to concede the future to trial and
error leading to everlasting trial and error---to, as James is quoted as
saying in Du Bois's lecture notes, living ""'under the sword of the
future.'"" For all its complexity and confusion, Du Bois's essay was also
intriguingly similar to solutions to the perennial matter-mind puzzle
worked out in Marx's [Kapital]{.epub-i} and, especially, Friedrich
Engels's then-untranslated, polemical [Anti-Duhring.]{.epub-i} Had Marx
and Engels been part of the Harvard bibliography of the day, James's
student could have discovered that Philosophy 4 brought him close to the
epistemology upon which the new dialectical materialism rested. Because
mind was immanent in nature, Marx and Engels maintained that the
structure and laws of the world became revealed through manipulation
(engagement) of the forces of nature. Essentially, ""The Renaissance of
Ethics"" waveringly arrived at the same conclusion: ethical imperatives
arose out of the interaction of mind and matter as both became
transformed and purposive through
willpower.[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-48){#cha-48}

The marginalia accompanying James's grade (A) pronounced ""The
Renaissance of Ethics"" a ""very original thesis, full of independent
thought and vigorous \[sic\] expressed,"" but it was also the work of a
man ""who is yet feeling his way to clearness and has a great deal of
extrication still to perform on his ideas."" Finally, James asserted his
bedrock conviction about the unbridgeable chasm between facts and
ethical beliefs. ""To me, that is impossible---we can only trust in its
ends being what we sympathize with."" The ""extrication"" James commended
was never quite achieved, and this engrossing essay Du Bois filed away
with his papers, deciding many years later, curiously, to turn it over
to Yale University library. If anything, the philosophical distance
between James and Du Bois would grow as the latter soon became committed
to a program of finite investigation, incremental accumulation of data,
and confidence that that unity of knowledge and discovery of truth,
behind or beyond mere contingency of which he wrote in his Philosophy 4
essay, was, with perseverance and intellect, possible. But by the end of
his first year, Du Bois had progressed far beyond the vague
transcendentalism of Great Barrington and the elaborate moral
tautologies of Nashville. Thanks to James, he had been guided ""out of
the sterilities of scholastic philosophy to realist pragmatism""---or so
he believed.[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-49){#cha-49}

At this distance, James's imprint on Du Bois is somewhat less distinct
than some recent students of ideas have believed. In a general sense,
the professor's extolling of a pluralistic society, robust espousal of
democracy, opposition to imperialism, and hostility to religious and
racial intolerance shaped his student's views of politics and
society---especially as these positions were accompanied by a natural
aristocrat's flattering accessibility and unconcern for posturing.
James's ideas and demeanor contrasted strikingly with those of such
popular professors as Shaler, Wendell, or Charles Eliot Norton, each of
whom variously displayed an aversion to the rise of popular culture and
majority rule. Wendell would serve up his cultural and political credo
soon after Du Bois left Harvard in [The Privileged Classes,]{.epub-i} a
work of exquisite snobbery. But to what extent, if at all, the insights
in James's [Principles of Psychology]{.epub-i} were the source of Du
Bois's own special insights into what he would describe as the double
nature of the African-American psyche remains highly ambiguous. Du Bois
probably did hear James expound on the neurological and epiphenomenal
nature of mind; certainly he would have read his favorite professor's
groundbreaking book soon after publication, in which suggestive terms
such as ""alternating selves"" and ""primary and secondary consciousness""
appeared. Through James, he may have had his awareness of the already
large body of medical and psychological literature about schizophrenia
heightened. The very term Du Bois was to employ in his most famous work,
[The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i}---""double consciousness""---had been
used to characterize mental disturbance in a case study in which James
was a consultant. That said (and with more to be said later), the
irreducible fact that Du Bois's existence, like that of other men and
women of African descent in America, amounted to a lifetime of being ""an
outcast and a stranger in mine own house,"" as he would write, was a
psychic purgatory fully capable by itself of nurturing a concept of
divided consciousness, whatever the Jamesian
influences.[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-50){#cha-50}

It was easier for Du Bois to get good grades than it was to find money
to stay in Harvard. It seemed he was not going to last out the year
without it. Prospects for getting the legacy that would come with the
settlement of Grandfather Alexander's estate were still dim (""for lack
of exact data concerning my father's death,"" he revealed). Winning the
fifty-dollar Boylston Prize for oratory would help considerably, and
Fisk debating experience was a considerable
asset.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-51){#cha-51} Du Bois would be
competing against the other African-American in Harvard College, Clement
Morgan, who was almost ten years older than himself. Morgan was the son
of Virginia slaves who had taken him to Washington, D.C., during the
Civil War, where he eventually completed secondary education at the
excellent M Street ""Colored"" public high school. After four years of
teaching and barbering in St. Louis, he came east, investing his
savings, while still barbering, in a Boston Latin School education. In
the fall of 1886, twenty-seven-year-old Morgan was admitted to Harvard
College. He and Du Bois took to each other, remaining somewhat close
friends and civil rights allies until Morgan's death in 1929. ""A
pleasant, unassuming person,"" Morgan was ""fairly well received"" by his
classmates, Du Bois
recalled.[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-52){#cha-52} Morgan's
academic record was not as strong as Du Bois's; he was by no means an
intellectual, but when it came to the spoken word it was said that few,
if any, of his classmates could excel him. In the second semester, 1889,
Morgan and Du Bois made history in the college theater by taking first
and second Boylston Prizes, respectively. Presumably, Du Bois adhered to
the theory of forensics, carefully developed at Fisk, which called for
blending ""every gesture and position"" so well that the audience forgot
the speaker ""in contemplation of his ideas""; but what he said however
has been lost beyond
retrieval.[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-53){#cha-53}

What was significant was that Du Bois made his classmates much more
aware of his presence, although they were probably not especially
charmed by it. Unlike the affable Morgan, or the wealthy William Monroe
Trotter, a cocky Bostonian about to enter Harvard, Du Bois was never
capable of mixing comfortably with his white classmates. The few efforts
he made left bruises. There was the glee club rejection his first year
and mention of other club rebuffs. He would have given his eyeteeth to
write for the [Harvard Monthly]{.epub-i} but was certain that the
editors ""were not interested in \[his\] major interests."" He did take
meals regularly at the nonexclusive Foxcroft Club, and very occasionally
he stopped to chat with Hutchins Hapgood, Augustus Hand, or Robert
Herrick in the Yard. He claimed in the [Autobiography]{.epub-i} that he
was closest to Robert Morss Lovett, a future [New Republic]{.epub-i}
editor, of all the white undergraduates who were invariably taken aback
by what seemed to them gratuitous [hauteur.]{.epub-i} Lovett, a
freshman, had met Du Bois in Shaler's class. After the upper classman's
Boylston celebrity, Lovett had sought his friendship, and the two of
them hiked as far as the dunes of Quincy several times. Fifty years
later, Lovett believed that he had not bothered to think of Du Bois ""as
a Negro until the double victory of himself and Morgan called attention
to the preeminence of that race in one aspect of eloquence."" Lovett's
relationship, such as it was at the time, was exceptional. Du Bois, for
his part, was so quick to anticipate condescension that chance
interracial encounters usually
fizzled.[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-54){#cha-54}

From the post-civil rights perspective of the late twentieth century,
his spiky relations with white peers may appear to have been symptomatic
of a morbid hypersensitivity. Harvard was more of a mirage than an oasis
of racial benevolence, but the Anglo-Saxon Protestant goodwill of its
president and much of the faculty was high-mindedly genuine. The place
was saturated by snobbery, certainly, with some of the most egregious
acts of social and racial superciliousness committed by professors
rather than students. Yet, as the Harvard experiences of Morgan and
Trotter testify (as well as those of other African-Americans in eastern
colleges), cordial relations, if not many deep friendships, did develop.
Moreover, to a significant degree difficult to measure, Du Bois's
behavior at Harvard should also be understood as a defensiveness
stemming from tensions of class and culture, rather than solely from
racial sensitivities. He was not unique in his feelings of being
something of an outsider. Entering Harvard as an undergraduate after
three years at Emporia College in Kansas, Vernon Lane Parrington, class
of 1893, was sharply disconcerted by the snobbery of the Yard. ""I could
have made friends had I tried,"" the future progressive historian snapped
in a manner reminiscent of Du Bois, ""but I didn't try, being as proud
and independent as I was poor."" Thirteen years later, Walter Lippmann
would arrive from New York, impeccably educated and equipped with a
small library, a dozen tailored suits, and two tennis rackets, only to
be astonished to find, says his biographer, that he couldn't ""scale the
social peaks at Harvard as easily as at Sachs \[School for
Boys\].""[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-55){#cha-55}

And yet, the fact that he was a young black man endowed with such acute
social insight did make Du Bois's lot a great deal harder than that
experienced by other outsiders who were white---religion, economic
background, or small-town formation notwithstanding. He saw himself as
driven into lonely defensiveness by the times. He was not one to be
deceived by surface civility or to turn a resigned or placatory face to
institutional discrimination. Indignation---constant, intellectualized,
and eloquently verbalized---must have been regarded by him as the only
face worthy of being presented to a white society whose philanthropy was
at best incidental and capricious, and at worst serving increasingly to
segregate and emasculate his race. The new northern wisdom in race
relations counseled the sons and daughters of the abolitionists that it
was unrealistic to expect African-Americans to measure up fully to
obligations of citizenship, that it was both kinder and more expedient
to entrust them to solutions devised by the white South. During Du
Bois's graduation year, the Mississippi legislature had rewritten the
state's constitution to eliminate the black voter. The decade of the
nineties would see a rash of articles and books about the ""Negro
Problem,"" a few of them compassionate but the majority arraigning the
race as the cause of its own suffering. Some, like the inflammatory
fiction ([The Leopard's Spots]{.epub-i}) of the unstable Baptist
preacher Thomas Dixon, Jr., and the merciless findings ([Race Traits and
Tendencies of the American Negro]{.epub-i}) of the Prudential insurance
statistician Dr. Frederick L. Hoffmann, virtually prescribed the race's
extinction. Nor had Du Bois to await the incoming tide of Negrophobic
titles in order to gauge the erosion of national support for his people.
Edwin Lawrence Godkin, the transplanted Anglo-Irish editor, had already
repeatedly sounded the retreat of northern white liberalism throughout
the seventies and eighties in the pages of [The
Nation.]{.epub-i}[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-56){#cha-56}

And from the pen of kindly old Nathaniel Shaler, the same professor who
had expelled from his class the southern boor who refused to sit next to
Du Bois, had come a widely read [Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i} piece, in
1884, predicting the relapse into barbarism of African-Americans now
removed from the tutelage of their slave masters. Fifteen years later,
although not so certain of Shaler's hypothesis, Albert Hart's [The
Southern South]{.epub-i} concluded that the experience of the race in
the North ""leads rather to negative than to positive conclusions as to
their intellectual and moral power."" If Du Bois seemed paranoid, he had
reason to believe his enemies were everywhere and numerous. Harvard must
have nurtured those biting, bitter insights that would explode a few
years later in the pages of [Atlantic Monthly, Dial, The
Outlook,]{.epub-i} and, like a supernova, in [The Souls of Black
Folk.]{.epub-i} ""'How does it feel to be a problem?', they say,"" one
such essay would parody. ""'I know an excellent colored man in my town;
or, I fought at Mechanicsville; or Do not these Southern outrages make
your blood boil?' At these I smile, or am interested, or reduce the
boiling to a simmer, as the occasion may require."" Du Bois's state of
mind in his senior year is revealed in a letter to George Washington
Cable, the white novelist and racial liberal who had relocated to
Massachusetts from his native Louisiana. Cable's denunciation of the
""New South"" gospel being effectively propagated in the North by southern
white supremacists was widely reported in the newspapers. ""In the midst
of so much confusion and misapprehension,"" Du Bois wrote on February 23,
1890, ""the clear utterance and moral heroism of one man, is doubly
welcome to the young Negro who is building a
Nation.""[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-57){#cha-57}

Fortunately, there was a world beyond Harvard. The Boylston Prize
competition gave its two winners the idea of offering public readings in
Connecticut and Massachusetts that summer for money. Well received in
Great Barrington, luck stayed with them as they traveled through eastern
Massachusetts. Du Bois and Morgan returned to Cambridge with about two
hundred dollars between them, and, to his relief, Du Bois found himself
awarded a three-hundred-dollar Matthews Scholarship. Before the end of
the year, he would reenter the Boylston competition, determined not to
""take less than a first prize,"" which he would. His money problems well
in hand, he drew up a list of advance courses, demanding even for a
confident senior who was regarded by many of his classmates as a
""grind.""[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-58){#cha-58} There was
Francis Peabody's Philosophy 11, Ethics of Social Reform, meeting
Tuesday and Thursday. Peabody's religiously tinged social-reform ideas
Du Bois found somewhat quaint, but the Boston Brahmin's racial integrity
impressed him. English D, Forensics, met on the same days as Ethics of
Social Reform. History 13, Constitutional and Political History of the
United States, met under Hart on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday;
Political Economy 1, with Mac Vane and Taussig, early Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday; Philosophy 6, Earlier French Philosophy from Descartes to
Leibniz and German Philosophy from Kant to Hegel, under Santayana
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 11:00 [A.M.]{.epub-sc}; and Philosophy
2, Logic and Psychology, under James on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at
noon. His work under Peabody, Hart, and Mac Vane and Taussig was
excellent, a string of
A's.[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-59){#cha-59}

Du Bois graduated cum laude on June 25, 1890, with a concentration in
philosophy. The class of 1890 majority had already broken dramatically
with the traditional Brahmin monopoly of class offices by selecting
Clement Morgan as class-day orator that year. Morgan played his part to
the hilt in the finest nineteenth-century rhetorical style, establishing
a tradition for a number of years in white colleges and universities of
selecting African-Americans as class orators. The selection of Du Bois
as one of the six student commencement orators was intended as another
signal of the university's evolution into a national institution
(Greener had been the first African-American to hold the
honor).[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-60){#cha-60} As President
Eliot and his platform guests, Mrs. Grover Cleveland, the governor of
Massachusetts, and the Episcopal bishop of New York among others,
watched, a slender student mounted the platform in Sanders Theatre with
an almost unmistakable self-possession and began his memorized address,
""Jefferson Davis as Representative of Civilization."" As Du Bois shifted
quickly into high gear, it was as though the audience had been instantly
hitched to a fast, new-model locomotive. Astonished applause exploded
when he finished in less than ten
minutes.[[61]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-61){#cha-61}

The Fisk commencement speech served as model, the president of the
Confederacy substituting for the chancellor of the Second Reich. Modern
conditions, Du Bois urged, desperately called for a new model to
complement the millennial primacy of the Strong Man as represented by
Davis. ""Under whatever guiseÂ ... as race, or as nation, his life can
only logically meanÂ ... the advance of a part of the world at the
expense of the whole,"" he explained; or, clearly echoing Royce, ""the
overwhelming sense of the I, and the consequent forgetting of the Thou.""
As counterforce to the Teutonic Strong Man, he proposed the Submissive
Man, of whom there was no better incarnation than the Negro. ""The
Teutonic met civilization and crushed it,"" the Sanders Theatre Teutons
heard. ""The Negro met civilization and was crushed by it."" Jefferson
Davis must be checked by the ""cringing slave,"" the blond beast by the
Christlike Negro, the people of rugged individualism and private gain by
a people animated by an idea of ""submission apart from cowardice,
laziness or stupidity, such as the world never saw before."" Du Bois
foretold a better world emerging from the dialectical struggle between
Strong Man and Submissive Man, ending his commencement speech with the
supplication, ""You owe a debt to humanity for this Ethiopia of the
Outstretched Arm.""[[62]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-62){#cha-62}

Bishop Potter of New York trotted out of the auditorium enthusiastic
about Du Bois's ""brilliant and eloquent address."" ""'Here is what an
historic race can do if they have a clear field, a high purpose, and a
resolute will,'"" he was quoted as saying in the Boston [Herald. The
Nation]{.epub-i} said the young scholar handled his ""difficult and
hazardous subject with absolute good taste, great moderation, and almost
contemptuous fairness."" The periodical [Kate Field's
Washington]{.epub-i} hailed the speech as ""a ten-strike"" and dubbed Du
Bois ""star of the occasion,"" polishing off its enthusiasm with an
amazingly prescient judgment, to be fulfilled forty-five years later:
""No history of the Civil War will be worth reading, saving as fiction,
untilÂ ... the spirit of \[Horace\] Greeley and Du Bois inspires its
writer."" Leonora Bowers spoke for a growing number of African-Americans
that Du Bois was beginning to inspire, writing in her Fisk circular
letter of being proud ""to be able to tell persons that he was a
classmate of mine."" If ""Jefferson Davis as Representative of
Civilization"" was fully as bold and brilliant as its commentators
claimed, it remained entangled, nevertheless, in nineteenth-century
racialist conceptions that would bedevil its author for many years
afterward. It also showed a normally pugnacious Du Bois calibrating his
message to flatter as carefully as any address ever given by Booker T.
Washington before a white
audience.[[63]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-63){#cha-63}

About three months before his graduation fame, Du Bois had petitioned
the Harvard Academic Council for scholarship assistance to pursue the
Ph.D. in social science, with a view, he wrote, ""to the ultimate
application of its principles to the social and economic rise of the
Negro people."" The topic of his dissertation was already clearly enough
formulated to share with Fisk classmates in the lengthy November
circular letter---""The Suppression of the African Slave Trade in
America,"" although the preposition [to]{.epub-i} would soon supplant
[in.]{.epub-i} Philosophy, his first love, had receded. Although he was
probably right to follow James's recommendation against philosophy as a
career because of practical considerations, there may have been another,
albeit secondary, reason. ""He used to give me A's and even A-plus,"" the
[Autobiography]{.epub-i} is quick to observe. In fact, after the A-- in
Philosophy 4, grades in his major field dropped to B during the senior
year: B+ in James's Logic and Psychology; B from Santayana in Earlier
French Philosophy. Compared to the superlative undergraduate record of
Santayana or Ralph Barton Perry (shortly to join the department), Du
Bois's performance in philosophy was merely impressive, and an
impecunious African-American scholar who was merely impressive as a
philosopher would have been merely a modest contributor to the struggles
of his emergent people, thus depriving them of the cogent guidance he
could render in the needier fields of the social
sciences.[[64]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-64){#cha-64}

Whether racism, subtle or unconscious, played any part in his
instructors' evaluations is a question that must be raised, even though,
from what is known, it cannot be adequately answered. Hart and Shaler
published deeply disturbing views on the alleged racial retardation of
African-Americans, but Du Bois's history and science grades were
uniformly excellent. Nor are there any revealing asides from the
philosophers in either published or private sources. Du Bois is not
mentioned in anything written by Santayana, unless it is implicit in the
reference to James's ""love of lame ducks and neglected possibilities.""
James lauded Du Bois publicly a few years later and gave him a letter of
introduction to his brother Henry in England. Finally, and most
instructively, Du Bois never made such a charge. It seems not unfair,
then, to suggest that Du Bois may have abandoned philosophy on the
grounds of aptitude, as well as
practicality.[[65]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-65){#cha-65}

The Academic Council was so impressed by his proposal that it surprised
Du Bois by awarding him a Henry Bromfield Rogers Memorial Fellowship of
\$450 almost immediately for graduate study in social science the
following year. Albert Hart had recommended him as showing ""distinct
ability."" At about the same time, a bearer of one of New England's most
distinguished names, James Bradley Thayer, recent successor of Oliver
Wendell Holmes to the Weld Professorship of Law, had written an
unsolicited letter endorsing Du Bois's candidacy. A former pupil, now
president of Atlanta University, had brought Du Bois's merits to
Thayer's attention. Thayer suggested that Harvard might owe ""some
special favorable consideration"" in light of the ""benevolent and
patriotic ends"" to which Du Bois proposed to dedicate his
life.[[66]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-66){#cha-66}

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[WITH WHAT]{.epub-sc} was left of his four-hundred-dollar inheritance
from Grandfather Alexander and the guarantee of a graduate stipend, and
""feeling rich and tired,"" for the first time in his life Du Bois spent a
summer trying to learn to relax. Consequently, as he wrote his Fisk
friends, he didn't have ""a very pleasant time,"" although he says he ate
more than enough and made lots of friends. Exactly what he did that
graduation summer, and with whom, is mostly a blank. It is significant,
though, that he spent time with brother Adelbert in Albany, New York,
and somehow (at least briefly) even ""had a good time
there.""[[67]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-67){#cha-67} Whatever he
did, he must have been generally enjoying himself more than his Fisk
letter admitted. By now, there were socially prominent persons in
Boston's African-American community who found it simply unthinkable that
a Harvard Man, and especially an overnight sensation (even one as
occasionally snappish as Du Bois), should remain in prickly isolation in
Flagg Street, the Philosophical Club, or the college library. He knew
something of this society already, very probably thanks to the affable
Clement Morgan; but from the chronology of social high moments beginning
to unfold after his graduation, it's improbable that, while he was an
undergraduate, Du Bois was as much at the center of Boston's affluent
African-American activities as he remembered half a century afterward in
[Dusk of Dawn.]{.epub-i} Even without burning late-night oil, his
undergraduate academic regimen left only so much time for amusement. And
an impecunious, supersensitive Du Bois, bearing a negligible Great
Barrington pedigree, would have been disinclined to risk his ego among
what was then the most preening, self-satisfied collection of black folk
in America. Becoming an integral part of Boston's ancient, inbred
African-American community during his first year of graduate studies was
as transforming in its own way as the Harvard curriculum. Once accepted
into it, he found an enclave where he was welcome ""without reservations
and annoying
distinctions.""[[68]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-68){#cha-68}

Among the city's nearly six thousand African-Americans no more than a
few dozen families possessed real influence or wealth in the eyes of
white Boston. And even they were beginning to lose their footing in the
early 1890s as the swift, post-Reconstruction tide of southern
accommodation, immigrant competition, and reordered social priorities of
the new corporate order rolled in. The days when Boston's chief merchant
tailor, principal wigmaker, and prestige stationer were
African-Americans, when Cambridge's exclusive Agassiz Grammar School was
headed by gracious Maria Baldwin and Boston's Lying-in Hospital
benefited from the resident expertise of Dr. Samuel Courtney of Harvard
Medical School were already fading. The Progressive journalist Ray
Stannard Baker wrote his investigative ""color line"" series on the North
in 1907 when hardly anything more than a shell remained of it, but when
Du Bois knew it in the faint afterglow of New England abolitionism,
affluent black Boston was still
healthy.[[69]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-69){#cha-69}

That society was presided over by aristocratic Mrs. Josephine St. Pierre
Ruffin, whose Virginia-freeborn husband, George Lewis Ruffin, an 1869
graduate of Harvard Law School, the first of his race, was briefly an
elected member of the Massachusetts legislature and judge of the Boston
Municipal Court at the time of his death in 1886. Mrs. Ruffin's roots
branched into France, England, and Africa. She was a [trÃ¨s grande
dame]{.epub-i} and as white of complexion as it was possible to be and
still be called a ""Negro."" Once, when a sympathetic Back Bay clubwoman
confessed an abiding interest in Mrs. Ruffin's race, the latter asked
grandly, ""Which race?"" She and her beautiful daughter ""Birdie"" held
weekly court in Charles Street where high and mighty freeborn
families---GrimkÃ©s, Pindells, Trotters, and others---regularly attended.
There were literary evenings salted with the poetry of Browning (whose
antecedents were widely believed to be ""mixed"") and musicales featuring
Brahms or the Chevalier de St. Georges (about whose mixed antecedents
there was no question).[[70]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-70){#cha-70}

But Josephine Ruffin, with her beehive of white hair and grand ways, was
more than a society hostess. Her politics were militant suffragette. She
numbered among her white acquaintances Julia Ward Howe and Lucy Stanton.
She thrust herself at the center of the national women's club movement,
representing a network of African-American clubwomen at national
conclaves, whether the ladies from the South liked it or not. She raised
such a couth ruckus about full acceptance at the 1900 Milwaukee General
Federation of Women's Clubs that the [Chicago Tribune]{.epub-i} called
for her to be gaveled into silence: ""Mrs. Ruffin belongs among her own
peopleÂ ... among us she can create nothing but
trouble.""[[71]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-71){#cha-71} Just as Du
Bois was being welcomed into the Charles Street circle, Josephine Ruffin
began publishing the [Courant,]{.epub-i} a weekly newspaper of women's
rights, civil rights, and informed opinion circulating far beyond Boston
and soon to carry some of Du Bois's earliest literary
effusions.[[72]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-72){#cha-72} Nowhere does
Du Bois suggest that Mrs. Ruffin's feminist politics influenced his own
precocious views about the rights of women. Mary Silvina's son had
already arrived at them independently by then, yet the distinguished
personalities and articulate opinions he met in Charles Street may well
have quickened and sharpened the positive views he had come to hold.

One thing Charles Street definitely sharpened was his amorous eye.
Nellie, the young woman he dated during his senior year at Fisk, was now
a slightly sad memory. Du Bois even admitted he felt just ""a little
ashamed"" of the way he had treated her, although he claimed they parted
as friends. He blamed his faithlessness on an ""old habit of universal
love-making,"" presumably dating from the summers in backcountry
Tennessee. He was interested in Geraldine (""Deenie"") Pindell, a
quintessential mulatto with wispy blond hair and blue eyes whose noted
uncle had led the successful fight in the 1850s to integrate Boston's
public schools. They dated occasionally, but dapper Monroe Trotter from
Hyde Park posed a clear and present danger destined to be fulfilled in
marriage.[[73]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-73){#cha-73} Then Maud
Cuney from Galveston, Texas, entered the Charles Street circle.

She was in her early twenties, a ""tall, imperious brunette, with
gold-bronze skin, brilliant eyes and coils of black hair."" Her father
was irrepressible Norris Wright Cuney, until his political destruction
and death in 1896 one of the most skillful, powerful African-American
politicians in the United States. Republican national committeeman from
Texas after 1884, Cuney delivered his people's vote with the expert
flair of a broncobuster, for which his considerable reward was a
presidential appointment as collector of customs at Galveston port.
Maud's Levantine good looks came from both parents, her fine musical
talent from her mother, and her head-high perseverance undoubtedly from
her father. When Du Bois met her she was just beginning the pianoforte
studies at the New England Conservatory of Music that would lead to an
arduous career as teacher, folklorist, and music historian. Later, she
would study under Emil Ludwig, a pupil of Anton Rubinstein. Her arrival
in the fall of 1891 had occasioned something of a scandal when the
school authorities unsuccessfully tried to exclude her from the
conservatory's dormitory because of her race. She and Du Bois would
remain much more than friends through the years of her companionable
marriage to a well-connected black Bostonian until her death in 1936.
""Du"" (Maud's endearment) fell in love with her almost on sight,
escorting her to Harvard social affairs and (he claims) asking her to
marry.[[74]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-74){#cha-74}

He found happiness with Maud in the Boston African-American community,
release from the pressures and challenge to seek more than marginal
social presence in white Cambridge. Yet there were, if not exceptions to
the rule of ethnic clannishness, such temporary exemptions in the Yard
as Clement Morgan and Monroe Trotter. Trotter entered the college in
1891, after being elected senior class president of his white high
school and graduating with highest honors. He stood third in his Harvard
class of 376 at the end of his first year. Domiciled in College House,
active in the Wendell Phillips Club, organizer of the small but
nettlesome Total Abstinence Club, first African-American junior Phi Beta
Kappa, notorious about Cambridge as a speeding cyclist, Trotter made his
Brahmin classmates notice, respect, and, to a degree far greater than Du
Bois had ever conceived possible, accept him. Du Bois was practically
bowled over by his confident gregariousness. He would ""like to have
known him and spoken to him,"" but the young Boston man scarcely appeared
to notice the solitary Du Bois. ""Colored students must not herd
together, just because they were colored,"" Trotter told him, dashing off
with his white friends and companions. ""And they liked him,"" Du Bois
recalled, just a bit wistfully. But then Trotter was nonpareil,
inheriting a \$20,000 fortune his freshman year from his father, the
improbable James Monroe, Civil War lieutenant in the 55th Massachusetts,
prominent Democrat in a race of reverent Republicans, and successor
after the venerated Frederick Douglass to the plum appointment under
Grover Cleveland of recorder of deeds of the District of
Columbia.[[75]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-75){#cha-75}

The Trotter family was remarkable among the remarkable families Du Bois
got to know, like the GrimkÃ©s of overwhelmingly white Hyde Park,
neighbors of the Trotters and also break-rank Democrats. The GrimkÃ©
family patriarch, Archibald Henry, was the slave son of South Carolinian
Henry GrimkÃ© (brother of Angelina and Sarah of abolitionist renown); he
was Harvard Law School's second African-American graduate, a newspaper
publisher, a prosperous law partner, and, under Grover Cleveland, the
resourceful consul to the Dominican
Republic.[[76]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-76){#cha-76} At some
point, Du Bois rediscovered a distant Boston cousin, apparently related
through a marriage tie of Mary Silvina's sister, Lucinda. Eliza Ann
Gardiner was a churchwoman of some means, active in the affairs of the
AME Zion denomination, and frequently provided Sunday meals to her
earnest young relative. Du Bois never forgot meeting in her home the
spellbinding AME Zion orator and southern college president, Joseph
Charles Price, who until his early death in 1893 was perhaps the only
serious rival of Booker T. Washington for the mantle of paramount race
spokesperson.[[77]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-77){#cha-77}

With the remaining money from Grandfather Alexander's estate, Du Bois
made quite a splash in Charles Street. His mood was expressed in another
letter to Fisk classmates, where he spoke of sporting a ""young but
promising mustache,"" and of his rather crass intention to ""get me a
little wife"" in three or four years. He accompanied a group on
excursions in the bay, boating on the Charles, and round-robin visits to
the handful of African-American students at other New England colleges.
One of those visits was to attend the 1892 graduation of two Amherst
men, William H. Lewis and George Forbes, classmates of Calvin Coolidge.
Lewis, one of the best footballers in the Ivy League, joined Clement
Morgan at Harvard Law the following year, played center for the
university, kept up his friendship with Du Bois, Forbes, and Trotter
until he had to choose between them and Booker T. Washington, and
eventually became assistant attorney general of the United States under
President Taft. The beautiful Elizabeth Baker went from Wellesley with
Du and Maud, Monroe and Deenie, and the others to Amherst on that proud
day, meeting Lewis, her future husband, for the first
time.[[78]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-78){#cha-78} In an issue of
the [Crimson]{.epub-i} from these days, Du Bois claimed there was a note
about himself, the high-strutting scholar, and his Maud. All of these
women appear to have had complexions light enough to permit them, had
they wished, to ""pass"" for white. In fact, one of them attended Vassar
under concealed racial identity. According to Du Bois, their light
complexions ultimately proved a bar to his marrying one of them. ""As a
sheer matter of taste,"" he wrote later, ""I wanted the color of my group
to be visible""---a curious boast in light of his marriage to a woman
whose physical characteristics were as racially ambiguous as the women
in the Charles Street
circle.[[79]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-79){#cha-79} Gilding his
prose as usual, he summed up Josephine Ruffin's realm beyond the Yard as
the place where college-bred African-Americans ""met and ate, danced and
argued and planned a new
world.""[[80]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-80){#cha-80}

Popular and comfortable as he was, it would have been out of character
if Du Bois hadn't decided that the culture and civic-mindedness of
Boston's black blue bloods needed improving. One Thanksgiving night,
therefore, a cooperative (though not much entertained) audience sat
through a performance of Aristophanes' [Birds]{.epub-i} in Charles
Street AME Church. Distressed by how little his exclusive circle
influenced the lives of the vast majority of Boston's African-Americans,
who failed abysmally in his eyes to capitalize their considerable
advantages, the Harvard graduate student sacrificed his ""limited
leisure"" on another occasion to say a word ""to the Negroes of
Boston.""[[81]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-81){#cha-81} Far more than
a word, ""Does Education Pay?"" his address to the city's National Colored
League in early March 1891, ran to the equivalent of eighteen printed
pages in Mrs. Ruffin's [Courant.]{.epub-i} Harvard president Eliot was
about to become a household name because of the ""five-foot shelf of
books"" he would urge Americans to acquire in the service of broader
intellectual culture. That evening Du Bois proposed a reading list in
black history spanning the millennia 900 [B.C.]{.epub-sc} to
[A.D.]{.epub-sc} 1900. He identified public institutions for cultural
enhancement, illustrated the impact of science and philosophy on daily
life, gently demolished the alibis and prejudices clung to by
hardworking folk, foretold the inevitable decline of a race that lived
an unexamined life, acknowledged his debt to Mary Silvina (""what I am is
hers""), and repeatedly enjoined his audience to ""get a liberal
education."" Booker T. Washington and his ideas in backwoods Alabama
about vocational education were then barely known, but in his essay
""Does Education Pay?"" Du Bois anticipated the nub of their differences.
""Never make the mistake of thinking that the object of being a man is to
make a carpenter,"" he told Bostonians; ""the object of being a carpenter
is to be a man.""[[82]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-82){#cha-82}

Returning to Cambridge late one night from Boston shortly before
graduation, Du Bois had had a memorable, chance encounter on a streetcar
with another Harvard man. ""'There's nothing in which I am particularly
interested!'"" the latter blurted out after a few minutes' talk about
careers. More than astonished, Du Bois wrote that he was ""almost
outraged to meet any human being of the mature age of 22 who did not
have his life all planned before him."" The anecdote sets the stage for
Du Bois's final two years of precisely planned scholarship at Harvard.
Bromfield Rogers fellows were required to submit annual progress
reports. In Du Bois's case, there were two of them because he held the
fellowship for a second year. Although he maintained the cordial
relationship with James and was still attending Philosophical Club
dinners, there were to be no more philosophy courses as he concentrated
on history and political economy under Hart, Channing, and
Taussig.[[83]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-83){#cha-83} Half his time
was spent in special research for History 20E under Hart for what would
finally become the monumental [Suppression of the African Slave Trade to
the United States of America, 1638--1870]{.epub-i}; the balance was
distributed over political economy, Roman law, early German history and
institutions, and English 12. What the extant blue books and bound
essays reveal is a common thread of robust analysis, a gutsy readiness
on Du Bois's part to reshape large quantities of knowledge to make them
fit into new conceptual containers. Undogmatic, intuitive, skeptical,
his intellectual powers as a graduate student were
arresting.[[84]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-84){#cha-84}

Du Bois had done excellent undergraduate work under Taussig in political
economy. When he wrote about Taussig's courses in the Marxist
[Autobiography,]{.epub-i} he may have been somewhat chagrined by how
well he had done. There is more than a hint in his undergraduate work of
the Harvard man's customary reverence for the iron laws of David
Ricardo, English free trade, and of brutal, arcane ""wages-fund"" theory
(funds for workers' wages after employers take their profits); but if he
really suspected at that time that Harvard was becoming ""rich and
reactionary"" because of men like Taussig, Du Bois's ""The Free Coinage
Controversy,"" an undergraduate paper written for Political Economy 1,
was a plutocrat's delight, roundly denouncing as sophistry, dishonesty,
and jingoism the popular platform of debt-ridden Populists and Silver
Democrats that called for coinage of silver at a ratio of sixteen to
every one ounce of gold. Not only did he plump for the gold standard in
his Taussig essay, he deplored as ""ignorant lawlessness"" disruptions to
business like those of the wave of railroad strikes in
1886.[[85]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-85){#cha-85} The Texas
railroad strikes beginning in March against Jay Gould's line had spread
quickly into Missouri, Arkansas, and Kansas. Freight had come to a dead
standstill throughout the Southwest. The ensuing violence in the
industrial and rail center of East St. Louis, Illinois, seemed to many
Americans to prefigure the long-dreaded civil war of labor against
capital. The Knights of Labor, ballooning to seven-hundred-thousand
strong, campaigned for an eight-hour workday and a national contract
labor law. In May, the Knights supported the workers striking the
McCormick Reaper Works in Chicago.

By late June 1886, the specter of a militant and mighty working class
assailing the citadels of capital caused alarm among the Goulds,
Carnegies, Morgans, and Pullmans, presenting them with splendid
opportunities for provocation and repression. Haymarket, on June 28, was
a turning point, and Du Bois appears to have applauded the swift,
callous retribution of the forces of order after an anarchist's bomb,
tossed from the packed crowd in the square, killed seven Chicago
policemen. As Du Bois finished his graduate studies in 1892, the titanic
struggle to reshape and consolidate the American economy---the Search
for Order to some historians or, perhaps more validly, the Triumph of
Conservatism to others---began in bloody earnest with the Pinkerton
carnage at the Homestead steelworks near Pittsburgh and in the copper
mines at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Social insurrection loomed beyond Harvard
Yard during most of the 1890s, as the political contest for control of
the national economy became increasingly savage between corporate power
and labor.[[86]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-86){#cha-86}

There is some evidence that Du Bois grew less sanguine about the
automatic corrections supposedly built into market forces. Academic
questions about capital, labor, rent, value, and wages took on
real-world trenchancy with the 1890 collapse of the powerful British
banking firm of Baring Brothers. Severe depression racked the land,
fusing angry farmers in the South and West, along with remnant Grangers,
greenbackers, Knights of Labor, silverites, and Utopian followers of
Edward Bellamy and Henry George, into a voting hoard almost overnight.
Secular evangelicals with tangy names like ""Sockless Jerry"" Simpson,
""Bloody Bridles"" Waite, and ""Pitchfork Ben"" Tillman fulminated against
banks, railroads, tariffs, industrialists, immigrants, and much more,
while others like Mary Elizabeth Lease circuit-rode among Kansas farmers
exhorting them to ""raise less corn and more hell."" As Du Bois settled
into his graduate studies, bankers, businessmen, and leaders of the two
national parties rubbed their eyes as this organized mass (southern
black and white people joining at the ballot box) captured four Senate
and fifty House seats in the fall elections of 1890. Two years later,
the People's party, speaking through the indignant voices of Tom Watson,
Ignatius Donnelly, and others at Omaha, Nebraska, called for the
nationalization of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones, a graduated
income tax, an eight-hour workday, all the silver that could be coined,
federal loans to farmers backed by crops stored in federal granaries,
and with much else radical, secret ballots, direct election of senators,
and immigration restriction. To the forces of order, populism was a
scaffold rather than a political
platform.[[87]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-87){#cha-87}

Du Bois expressed his unease cautiously, abstractly, by grappling with
the value to be placed on labor and the commodities it produced. Under
Taussig, and in other departments of political economy at well-endowed
universities, the subject was formulated with a theoretical exactitude
in which the sacrifice of workers' wages to employers' profits was the
first postulate of economic sanity and growth. Profligacy,
overpopulation, unemployment, and starvation awaited those workers who
temporarily forced more out of the economy than the iron law of wages
allowed. Du Bois makes clear straightaway his dissatisfaction with
supposed laws governing wages. ""A Constructive Critique of Wage-Theory,""
a 158-page, handwritten entry for the prestigious Toppan Prize his first
year, appears to have been too venturesome for the judges, who may also
have found it almost as opaque in spots. Corrected spellings and other
signs of haste mar an ambitiously expanded political economy paper. From
his readings of John Stuart Mill and David Ricardo, Du Bois announced
that he had developed a theory of wages, which, after checking
""different wage-theories to see if any resembled mine,"" he now believed
to be unique. Although his essay managed to be by turns both precise and
murky, what Du Bois essentially seemed to be proposing by his ""hierarchy
of wants"" was society's obligation to moderate profit as the sole engine
for the distribution of wealth, an idea that would have been in keeping
with the humane values expressed in the Jefferson Davis
speech.[[88]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-88){#cha-88}

The paper may not have made any contribution to economic theory, but his
concern was a significant reflection of Du Bois's imaginative need for
theoretical formulations in which humanist justifications prevailed.
""Critique of Wage-Theory"" was also interesting because the two pages
devoted to the labor theory of surplus value---sandwiched between
equally careful encapsulations of Walter Bagehot, Stanley Jevons, Alfred
Marshall, and Sidney Webb---show that Du Bois knew far more about
Marxist economic theory at Harvard than he subsequently let
on.[[89]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-89){#cha-89} Du Bois would be
gone before the ravaging Panic of 1893, which gave populism such
credibility and force that the custodians of the status quo believed
they were looking into the maw of doom, but his disdain for the movement
as revealed in his undergraduate economics essay almost surely would
have remained, given his deep-seated elitism. A proper colored
gentleman, he admits to having felt a twinge of sentiment when the
Anglo-Saxon world paused to observe the Diamond Jubilee of Queen
Victoria, now empress of India, and to having cheered the European
explorers, soldiers, and missionaries bringing Christianity,
civilization, and commerce to darker peoples. The linkage to the ""race
problem"" in America had simply not yet occurred to
him.[[90]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-90){#cha-90} On the other hand,
this long, dense ""Critique of Wage-Theory"" groped for a formulation of
the wages problem less Darwinian than the prevailing one, more benign
and community-oriented. The essay was much more a reflection of its
author's aristocratic proclivities than of any will to affirm Socialist
principles. Vulgar wealth troubled him greatly, but so did vulgar
democracy.[[91]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-91){#cha-91}

The same gift for imaginative analysis characterized his work under
Hart. When it came time to impart meaning to a documentary welter of
bills of sale, criminal codes, statutes, and statistics, Du Bois's
imagination was invariably active, as in ""Contributions to the Negro
Problems,"" an essay handed in to Hart probably during the second
semester of 1891. Anticipating interpretations that were only to gain
credibility in the late 1960s, he argued against the scholarly
presumption that slavery had come about partly because the ""repulsion
between the whites and the blacks is instinctive."" The documents, he
insisted, tended to prove that ideological racism ""only appeared after a
long period of artificial fostering by the laws of the land."" The
ability to leap from evidence to reinterpretation was something Hart
encouraged in his prize graduate student, although he himself was
anything but imaginative. ""He was dry as dust, so far as that's
concerned,"" Du Bois said later. A recent doctorate from the University
of Freiburg, Hart's forte was research methodology. His imprint upon the
study of history in early twentieth-century America was unmatched, as
the growing corps of Ph.D.s trained by him under the new seminar method
rose through tenure to positions of command in departments throughout
the country. Unlike John Fiske or Frederick Jackson Turner, historians
given to sweeping deductions, Hart cautiously threaded his way through a
thicket of particulars. To find out what had actually happened in
history, he drummed into his students the sanctity of primary sources
and of careful scrutiny of
documents.[[92]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-92){#cha-92}

But there were two Harts: the walrus-mustached Hart whose graduate
seminars were conducted in strictest conformity to German
historiographic rigor; and the other in whom the Puritan conviction of
the North's moral and economic rectitude in the Civil War was
unalterably fixed. God and history were with the Union. Slavery was a
wrong that ""affected the social and economic life of the people,"" his
widely read ""Why the South was Defeated in the Civil War"" announced in
the [New England Magazine.]{.epub-i} For all his scientific methodology,
Du Bois's principal professor remained an old-fashioned moralist for
whom character was the key determinant---the ""inner man not the
outer""---in social
change.[[93]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-93){#cha-93} Hart was
troubled, therefore, by his beliefs about the prospects of black people
in America. If the antebellum South had been nothing but irremediable
decadence behind a showy facade, another of Hart's [a priori]{.epub-i}
convictions---elaborated after months of southern travel in a popular
book on the subject ([The Southern South,]{.epub-i} 1910)---was that the
Negro was a moral and social cripple. Yet his abolitionist optimism and
social-science scrupulosity kept him from becoming a misanthropic
racist. He remained a [liberal]{.epub-i} racist, reading virtually
everything written by both races on the South and the Negro, factoring
in the cultural, economic, and political debits of slavery, and the
significance of such exceptional minds as the historian George
Washington Williams's and his own student Du Bois's before deciding that
""the supposed inferiority of the negro is not a foregone conclusion."" In
the case of Du Bois, Hart concluded almost immediately that the
presumption of inferiority did not apply, although he seems never to
have made up his mind as to just what that meant, writing confidentially
much later that Du Bois was ""living proofÂ ... that a mulatto may have as
much power and passion as any white
man.""[[94]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-94){#cha-94}

""Harvard and the South,"" another argumentative Du Bois piece that may
have been written for Peabody's course, was a fascinating blend of the
economic determinism and sociological evangelism typical of the Gilded
Age, two strains uppermost in Du Bois's thinking. The South's peculiar
civilization cannot be explained by theories of psychology or climate.
At its core, Du Bois says, was a ""vast economic mistake"" based on
oligarchy and planned underdevelopment. Where there is industrial
growth, ""parallel evolution of political rights and social prosperity
has been the striking feature of modern history,"" but the New South of
Henry Grady was the exception---a modern feudalism in which
profit-taking is maximized by denying all black people their rights and
most white people their
dignity.[[95]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-95){#cha-95} A practice
shot at a large future target was to be heard in his warning of the
""catastrophe"" certain to result from ""giving the future leaders of the
Negro people ten hours at the plow and one at the spelling book."" Du
Bois's facile solution was to have Harvard educate the South's best
white and black minds in the most advanced principles of sociology,
while a system of university education should be established below the
Mason-Dixon Line for the benefit of the elites of both
races.[[96]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-96){#cha-96}

Hart was sufficiently impressed by Du Bois's master's thesis on the
Atlantic slave trade to arrange for him to present it to the American
Historical Association (AHA) meeting in Washington, DC., in December
1891. Arguing that the North's colluding with the South in
nonenforcement of the constitutional ban on importing slaves after 1808
created an economic monster that nearly devoured the republic, Du Bois
attributed the staggering increase in the South's slave population to an
uninterrupted influx of smuggled Africans---a major flaw that would be
carried over into his book on the subject published four years later.
His mistake was based on reasonable deduction and was unsuspected by
virtually all contemporary
historians.[[97]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-97){#cha-97} In ""The
Enforcement of the Slave Trade Laws,"" his AHA paper, the
twenty-two-year-old scholar held the respectful attention of the
distinguished seniors as he traced the fatal consequences of the moral
compromise brokered at the very moment of the American republic's
creation. Moral turpitude had been transformed into economic
determinism, Du Bois argued. ""If slave labor was an economic god,"" he
concluded with a memorable turn of phrase, ""then the slave trade was its
strong right arm.""[[98]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-98){#cha-98}

Much later scholarship would demonstrate that the slavocracy slaked its
labor hunger in the 1840s and 1850s through natural population increases
over time, rather than by illegal importation of slaves, but Du Bois's
larger economic account of institutional impotence on the part of the
North was highly valuable for the times. The reporter for the New York
[Independent]{.epub-i} pronounced the paper one of the three best at the
conference: ""here was an audience of white men listening to a black
man---listening, moreover, to a careful, cool, philosophical history of
the laws which have not prevented the enslavement of his race."" It was
all so extraordinary, the reporter decided, that Americans need not
""worry about the future of our country in the matter of race
distinctions.""[[99]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-99){#cha-99} The
bestowal of the Master of Arts degree in June 1892 must have come almost
as an anticlimax.

In addition to mastering history, Du Bois had worked with almost equal
diligence to perfect a prose style that became the signature of his
ideas and opinions so completely that it is somewhat surprising to
discover that it was not innate. The generally clear and frequently
vivid writings from the early Harvard period are marred only here and
there by a misspelling or malapropism, due largely to haste; but they
tended to be more eloquent than elegant, more descriptive than
metaphorical. Determined to acquire a literary style to carry his
message, he enrolled in Wendell's English 12 in his first year of
graduate studies. The class met three times a week, with Jefferson B.
Fletcher assisting Wendell in grading the fifty-odd, half-sheet themes
written daily and due each meeting. Undergraduates found the robust,
red-bearded Wendell a ""character,"" and took to imitating his speech and
squirarchical mannerisms. Du Bois thought Wendell was British because of
his ""Oxford accent""---but the accent, like the spats, cane, and cape,
were affectations. Wendell's waspish friend Santayana called him one of
Harvard's ""stray souls,"" who longed for an American aristocracy, was an
excellent teacher, fastidious about style, and witty but with a mind,
like his speech, ""explosive and
confused.""[[100]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-100){#cha-100}

But if the master of Harvard's most famous undergraduate course was
colorful, his literary tastes were distinctly conventional. A stickler
for ""manliness"" and good form, what he called ""rum and decorum,"" there
was no place in his canon for the likes of the ""indecent"" Guy de
Maupassant or the ""eccentric"" Walt Whitman. Good writing, like good
politics, meant fidelity to what was ""Reputable, National, and
Present""---no vulgarity, slang, neologisms, or technical accretions need
apply. Du Bois quickly caught Wendell's attention with a snappy piece
titled ""Something About Me,"" which the professor read aloud, to Du
Bois's immense pleasure. ""In early youth a great bitterness entered my
life and kindled a great ambition,"" the piece concluded candidly. ""I
wanted to go to college because others did. I came and graduated and am
now in search of a Ph.D. and bread. I believe, foolishly perhaps but
sincerely, that I have something to say to the world and I have taken
English twelve in order to say it
well.""[[101]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-101){#cha-101}

Not all of Du Bois's themes were so well received, though. ""Autumn
Leaves"" was painstaking---""commonplace""---and one about a visit from two
Fisk friends was ""a bit crude."" Another, ""Frightened,"" was dismissed as
""flippant."" ""The American Girl"" sinned badly against Wendell's canon of
taste. William Dean Howells had sparked considerable comment a few years
earlier when he had explored the topic of the American girl in [Atlantic
Monthly]{.epub-i} but in a far different vein from the Harvard graduate
student. What provoked Du Bois can only be guessed at (some incident
reminding him of the visiting-card episode in the ""wee wooden
school-house""?), but he handed Wendell and Fletcher a tirade beginning,
""When I wish to meet the American hog in its native simplicity; when I
wish to realize the world-pervading presence of the Fool; when I wish to
be reminded that whatever rights some have I have noneÂ ... I seek the
company of the American girl."" Holding this piece at a distance, Wendell
commented acidly, ""Such truculence as yours is thoroughly injudicious.
Nothing could more certainly induce an average reader to disagree.""

By the second semester, Du Bois's themes were earning comments such as
""fairly interesting"" for ""Historical Conference,"" ""vivacious"" for
""Wedding Reception,"" ""realistic, amusing"" for ""Debating Club,"" and ""good
description"" for ""Dekalb
County.""[[102]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-102){#cha-102} All in all,
he got what he bargained for from Wendell's course. The gauche images
and pleonasms were much less in evidence. A certain ornateness and
gravity took hold, while punctuation and spelling vastly improved. The
Du Boisian prose style, noble, metaphorical, reaching backward to
classical models rather than forward into experimentation, began to
crystallize. Old-fashioned and high-toned, it was saved from the
stiltedness that slavish fidelity to Wendell would have induced by its
flashing insights and magisterial indignation. His immersion in the
works of Carlyle had yielded a rhythm and prose ideal for expressing
insights and outrage. [The French Revolution,]{.epub-i} Carlyle's
dazzling, Calvinist history of divine chastisement and human agency,
would remain near at hand. Certain as to what he wanted to say, Du Bois
now had the literary form in which to convey it to the world.

What more could Harvard offer him? Even as he petitioned the trustees
for permission to expand his master's into a doctorate, he was
orchestrating a campaign to win a fellowship for study in Europe.
Although there is nothing on the subject in the correspondence, he must
have been told, at least informally, that Harvard's Walker Travelling
Fellowship was unavailable, otherwise he certainly would have applied.
But there was another option, although in the year and a half since a
friend had first mentioned it to him during a card game, prospects had
seesawed maddeningly. Handed a Boston [Herald]{.epub-i} clipping dated
November 2, 1890, Du Bois read that the president of the John F. Slater
Fund for the Education of Negroes had offered to underwrite the European
education of ""any young colored man in the South whom we find to have a
talent for art or literature."" In a speech at Johns Hopkins University,
Rutherford B. Hayes, the president who had dismantled Reconstruction and
now presided over the million-dollar Slater benefaction, had added that
it was very doubtful such a Negro existed. ""Hitherto,"" said Hayes (in
what was surely a dismissive reference to Du Bois's friend Morgan),
""their chief and almost only gift has been that of oratory."" Du Bois had
rushed at the challenge; ""No thought of modest hesitation occurred to
me."" Two days after the [Herald]{.epub-i} story appeared, he sent a
detailed letter announcing that he was just what the Slater Fund was
looking for.[[103]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter5-103){#cha-103} That he
would also be leaving Maud Cuney behind, if the fund eventually
recognized his claim, was the bittersweet price of destiny.

G[OING]{.epub-sc} O[VER]{.epub-sc} N[IAGARA]{.epub-sc}

[Du Bois and Washington]{.epub-bi}

B[OOKER T. WASHINGTON]{.epub-sc} lived in a two-story redbrick house
separated from the Tuskegee campus by a narrow road. It was a large
house, a comfortable one, T-shaped under a sharply sloping roof, with a
deep, colonnaded porch bordered by gleaming white balustrades. He called
it The Oaks. It stood almost directly opposite the newly erected
Carnegie Library, also a two-story brick structure, which had been built
with such economy by Tuskegee students that the donor's modest \$20,000
gift had proved exactly sufficient to the task. The current mistress of
The Oaks was the former Margaret James Murray, the third Mrs. Booker T.
Washington, as handsome as she had been during Du Bois's undergraduate
years at Fisk, but considerably fuller in figure and, after careful Fisk
grooming, a polished queen bee bearing no trace of her humble origins.
What was discussed between Dr. and Mrs. Washington and their
distinguished dinner guest on the evening of July 6, 1903, as
white-jacketed students served choice cuts of poultry and meat, is
unrecorded. Du Bois had come to Tuskegee without Nina and baby Yolande
to lecture in the institute's summer session and to maintain correct
relations with its master. A letter from Washington to his director of
the summer school, Harvard-educated Roscoe Conkling Bruce, suggests that
Du Bois was being well compensated for his
services.[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-1){#cha-1}

An appropriate topic of dinner conversation would have been a review of
the plans drawn up by Du Bois at Washington's suggestion for a major
conference bringing together leaders of the principal factions of the
race. Confidentially canvassing some of these leaders, among them Kelly
Miller, Du Bois had written enthusiastically in early February of this
unprecedented ""chance for a heart to heart talk with Mr. Washington,""
enclosing a typically bold and comprehensive ten-point working agenda
covering such things as education, voting, civil rights litigation, a
legal defense fund, and a national publication. The Wizard's interest in
a conference flagged immediately. Since then, Washington had said no
more about it; probably nothing was said about it at dinner. What seems
most remarkable in retrospect is that the Washingtons and Du Bois were
able to dine together barely four months after the publication of [The
Souls of Black Folk.]{.epub-i} Despite the welling controversy
surrounding Du Bois's book, the Tuskegee principal felt secure enough to
welcome a severe critic into his home. After all, while national
newspapers and journals of opinion were full of reactions to
[Souls,]{.epub-i} Tuskegee's endowment, thanks to a single night of
fund-raising at Madison Square Garden, was overflowing.

Perhaps Washington had blanched inwardly that April night in the Garden
when ex-President Grover Cleveland spoke of ""a grievous amount of
ignoranceÂ ... laziness and thriftlessness"" among nine million
African-Americans; perhaps he had felt some distress when Edgar Gardner
Murphy of the SEB characterized them as ""a rotting bodyÂ ... polluting
the atmosphere we breathe""; and Washington may even have grieved when
Lyman Abbott rose to praise the superiority of the white race. Had a
meteor collapsed the roof of the Garden that night, much of the nation's
leadership community of finance, philanthropy, and higher education
would have been buried beneath the rubble. In serried rows of
self-satisfied paternalism sat the Baldwins, the Ogdens, the Peabodys,
the Carnegies, Mrs. Collis P. Huntington, Jacob Schiff, William
Schieffelin, Oswald Villard, Nicholas Murray Butler, and a great many
more. On April 24, ten days after the fund-raiser, and not quite three
weeks after McClurg released [Souls,]{.epub-i} Andrew Carnegie handed
over \$600,000 in U.S. Steel bonds to the Tuskegee endowment fund,
\$150,000 of which was to be set aside for the personal use of the
Wizard and his family.[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-2){#cha-2}
With an endowment placing Tuskegee in the ranks of the country's richest
educational institutions, the principal must have found it as easy to be
gracious at dinner with Du Bois as to pronounce a homily on dental
hygiene before his student body.

There was undoubtedly another factor at play. The invitation to dine at
The Oaks came less than a week after the Wizard's forces had
humiliatingly routed Monroe Trotter and other opponents at the annual
meeting of the Afro-American Council at Louisville, Kentucky. Smarting
from the clean sweep by Bookerites the previous year, the Trotter
faction came to Louisville with a quiver full of anti-Washington
resolutions, determined to disrupt the final session, if necessary.
Trotter had excoriated Du Bois for remaining neutral at the 1902 meeting
in Minnesota, claiming that Du Bois was ""like all the others who are
trying to get into the bandwagon of the Tuskegeean."" Du Bois had decided
to stay away from Louisville, where Trotter was procedurally
outmaneuvered by a temporarily sober Thomas Fortune (now the
organization's president and faithful servant of Tuskegee), drowned out
by the huzzahs greeting the arrival of the Wizard, and finally silenced
with threats of physical
expulsion.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-3){#cha-3}

Every Saturday since November 1901, Trotter and George Forbes, his
coeditor and a librarian at the Boston Public Library, had published the
Boston [Guardian,]{.epub-i} what Trotter called a ""clean, manly, and
newsy race paper,"" regularly giving Washington and his allies a
well-edited raking over the coals. The [Guardian]{.epub-i} was exactly
like its editor, indiscreet, brilliant, and merciless in the pursuit of
perceived racial fraud. Fortune's [Age]{.epub-i} gagged that the
newspaper was ""putrescent."" Sometimes, it was simply outrageous, as in
this 1902 description of Booker Washington addressing a public meeting
in Boston:

His features were harsh in the extreme. His vast leonine jaws into which
vast mastiff-like rows of teeth were set clinched together like a vice.
His forehead shot up to a great cone; his chin was massive and square;
his eyes were dull and absolutely characterless, and with a glance would
leave you uneasy and restless during the night if you had failed to
report to the police such a man around before you went to
bed.[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-4){#cha-4}

Cautious, apprehensive, Du Bois found himself drawn, nevertheless, by
the old school tie to Monroe Trotter and Geraldine (""Deenie"") Pindell
Trotter, still beautiful and full of fire. The three shared Harvard and
Boston and a belief in social equality, and, by extension, a gnawing
disgust with Booker Washington's cruel parodying of their values. But
Trotter's biting ridicule of the Wizard struck Du Bois as extreme and
self-defeating. As the last course was served at The Oaks that Monday
evening, the unwisdom of aligning himself openly with a noisome faction
against the master politician at the other end of the dinner table may
well have been on Du Bois's mind.

Within the month, however, Trotter returned to the offensive, and when
he did the scandal he created soon brought the Du Bois--Washington
controversy to flashpoint. Learning that Washington had accepted an
invitation to address the Boston chapter of the National Negro Business
League at the Columbus Avenue AME Zion Church on the evening of July 30,
Trotter and Forbes orchestrated the disruption of the meeting. For
nearly a decade, the Tuskegee principal's public appearances had
attracted the widest attention. Leading citizens of both
races---politicians and preachers, traction magnates and university
presidents---turned out to hear him and to ponder the broad implications
of his social philosophy. On a stiflingly hot night, therefore, some two
thousand Bostonians packed the black church on Columbus Avenue.

When William Lewis of Amherst and Harvard football renown rose in the
packed and overheated church to introduce Thomas Fortune---widely viewed
as the brains of the Tuskegee Machine, especially when in good
health---there was hissing and the scraping of feet. Since the beginning
of 1903, Lewis had been a fervent Bookerite. Five years earlier, his
radical feelings had been so strong that, when the Wizard risked a
rough-and-tumble session with college students at Young's Hotel in
Boston, Lewis had bluntly told the Tuskegeean to confine his creed of
accommodation to the South. The Wizard had dangled a racial first under
Lewis's nose---assistant U. S. attorney for the state of Massachusetts.
Neither Lewis's new federal distinction nor singer-composer Harry
Burleigh's voice were able to contain the disaffection spreading among
the capacity interracial audience. At least a score of Trotter's
followers sprang into action, shouting, filling the aisles, and moving
toward the dais. After police arrived to enforce calm, a fit of violent
sneezing gripped Fortune when he tried again to speak. Someone had
sprinkled cayenne pepper on the rostrum during the confusion. When Lewis
rose again, it was as though an earthquake struck the tabernacle on
Columbus Avenue the moment he presented Booker Washington.

Fistfights broke out. Trotter's sister was alleged to have stabbed
patrolman ""Pat"" Malley with her hatpin. Many women swatted adversaries
with hats and purses, while others fainted in the terrific heat of the
night. Trotter jumped up and down on a pew, bellowing awkward questions
at the Wizard, until he was overwhelmed by the din and the police. The
Wizard's daughter, Portia, then a student at nearby Bradford Academy,
was there that night. She hated Trotter and his newspaper for announcing
to the world that she had washed out of Wellesley, and felt she might
have struck out at him had her seat not been so far away. Immobile and
expressionless, Dr. Washington surveyed the pandemonium from the
platform. Trying to make sense of what was happening, a stunned white
reporter wrote that many were shouting such things as ""We don't like
you"" and ""Your views and aims are not what we sympathize with or think
best for our race."" The scrimmaging finally stopped, and when the savior
of his people was able to speak, it was clear that he had nothing new to
say. The morning after the Columbus Avenue church assembly, newspapers
across the nation carried reports of riotous clashes, bodily ejections,
one knifing, and the arrest of Monroe and Maude Trotter and two
others.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-5){#cha-5} To horrified
northern philanthropists and alarmed southern segregationists, as well
as to Washington's vast numbers of African-American admirers, the Boston
""Riot"" was as unexpected as an earthquake.

If the Wizard had failed to find the words to restore his authority that
hot July night, his Tuskegee Machine clanked immediately into high gear
in order to achieve that goal. Washington, Fortune, and Scott knew that
white philanthropy would not bankroll a leader whose northern itinerary
was strewn with broken church furniture, jailed Ivy League graduates,
and screaming headlines. If the impact of [The Souls of Black
Folk]{.epub-i} on civil rights was like that of [Uncle Tom's
Cabin]{.epub-i} on slavery, then Trotter's Boston ""Riot"" had its civil
rights analogue in John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. A tiny band of
men and one woman had caused the Wizard the greatest embarrassment of
his career to date. The faithful Scott assured his employer that he knew
the identity of the real culprits behind Trotter---""men who have more
brains, if no more character, then \[sic\] he: Archibald H. GrimkÃ©,...
Clement G. Morgan, George W. Forbes, W. H. Ferris, all college men, and
J\[ohn\] W. A. ShawÂ ... down at the heels."" The Wizard's personal
communiquÃ© to President Roosevelt in mid-September had the feel of being
written with sweaty palms. He was ""sorry that the matter has caused
\[Roosevelt\] any concern""; reports were ""very much exaggerated""; his
attackers were ""artificial"" men, ""graduates of New England colleges.""
But the president should know that ""rank and file"" colored people loved
and supported both of
them.[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-6){#cha-6} Prosecution of the
jailed Trotter was set in motion. Assistant U. S. Attorney William Lewis
testified at the trial that his former Harvard friend had entered into a
conspiracy to disturb the peace, and Trotter's maximum sentence of
thirty days in jail would be sustained on appeal. Meanwhile, Forbes, the
quiet librarian, was threatened with dismissal from the Boston Public
Library and eventually intimidated into signing over his stock in the
[Guardian]{.epub-i} to Lewis. Three rival black Boston newspapers rose
and collapsed in rapid succession, each covertly financed by the
Tuskegee Machine. That September, a libel suit to break the
[Guardian]{.epub-i} was filed by a young African-American senior at
Yale, William Pickens, a poor, quick-witted Arkansas man whose college
expenses were probably partially defrayed by the Wizard. Pickens's
prizewinning speech in the 1903 Yale oratorical contest questioned the
capacity of Haitians for self-government, and Trotter's newspaper had
called Pickens ""a little black freak student at Yale,"" a man devoid of
""self-respect."" New York lawyer Wilford H. Smith, the Wizard's personal
attorney, leapt to take charge of Pickens's
indignation.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-7){#cha-7}

Meanwhile, Du Bois had reached Boston from Tuskegee several days after
the riot, without any ""inkling or suspicion in any way of the matter,""
as he assured the aghast George Foster Peabody months later. Indeed,
although he placed much of the blame for the imbroglio on the manner in
which Lewis had chaired the meeting, Du Bois had firmly deplored the
conduct of Trotter, in whose house he was a guest. As he followed
developments, Du Bois saw that he was going to have to choose, that he
couldn't ""occupy middle ground and try to appease the
[Guardian]{.epub-i} on the one hand and the Hampton-Tuskegee idea on the
other."" A blunter formulation of his dilemma at that stage would have
been that it was far less a choice of ideas than of evading an
irresistible juggernaut. He could feel the tenseness, the plotting, the
""strength and implacability of the Tuskegee Machine."" Even so, he joined
his faculty colleague George Towns in sending Trotter letters of
sympathy in early October, on the eve of the editor's unsuccessful
appeal of his thirty-day sentence. Both Atlanta professors wrote that
Trotter and his followers were being persecuted for exercising the right
of free speech, Du Bois charging that they were victims of ""petty
persecution and dishonest attack."" Towns's letter, however, even went so
far as to excuse the riotous behavior. Trotter and Forbes were ""too
radical to suit me,"" Du Bois wrote an influential Talented Tenth
associate, ""but they are self sacrificing,"" and the attack on Pickens's
Yale speech was honest. Meanwhile, as Trotter angrily paced his cell,
the shellshocked Forbes complied with Pickens's demand that a full
apology be printed in the
[Guardian.]{.epub-i}[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-8){#cha-8}

Nursing his wounds in Europe, the Wizard was much put out by clippings
from the [Guardian]{.epub-i} and several articles from the Boston
[Transcript,]{.epub-i} which reached him in Paris. Under the byline
""Fair Play,"" Kelly Miller, a man whose consistent moderation annoyed
both Trotterites and Bookerites, had ventured to observe that ""few
thoughtful colored men espouse what passes as Mr. Washington's policy,""
although Miller insisted that he opposed the immoderation of the
Trotterites. Rattled, and mindful of Ogden's distress at the turn events
were taking, Washington finally launched a personal attack on the man he
had done so much to convert. He thought Ogden ought to know, he wrote
immediately after returning from Europe, that he had ""evidence which is
indisputable showing that Du Bois is very largely behind the mean and
underhanded attacks that have been made upon me during the last six
months."" In fact, Washington had no such proof, yet he repeated these
charges to Frissell of Hampton in early November, even while he was
discussing strategy about the Pullman Company discrimination case by
telephone with Du Bois. As that long-pursued matter sank into a
permanent limbo, Washington and Du Bois's enmity rapidly came into the
open. Ogden, now almost apoplectic, had seen enough of this Talented
Tenth insurgency. He told Washington he was ""beginning to think that the
toleration of such men as Towns and Du Bois"" would prove fatal to
Atlanta University. Du Bois was not even ""intellectually honest,"" and
President Bumstead himself was probably implicated in the Boston Riot,
Ogden added.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-9){#cha-9}

Baldwin and the troubled George Foster Peabody had lodged a formal
protest over Towns's sympathy letter after it had been promptly
published in the [Guardian,]{.epub-i} while reliable sources signaled to
Horace Bumstead that the institution's chances of ever receiving money
from Carnegie and Rockefeller benefactions were nonexistent. By the end
of the year, Atlanta University's president and trustees were nervous
wrecks. Towns's letter ""was so objectionable and the situation in which
it involved the University was so serious,"" the distraught Bumstead
informed Du Bois, as to require action by the executive committee of the
trustees. Bumstead could not bring himself to believe the numerous
rumors that Du Bois had any ""connection with the conspiracy of which Mr.
Trotter was convicted."" Formal apologies to the Wizard (magnanimously
accepted) were voted by the trustee board, and Towns received a
blistering reprimand from
Bumstead.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-10){#cha-10} Even though
Du Bois had never justified the riot as Towns had, in his eyes the
reaction of his university in groveling before Booker Washington verged
on surrender of academic freedom. Aroused and thoroughly disgusted, he
took it upon himself to answer Peabody's concerns in a lengthy letter
precisely accounting for his movements during the weeks in question.
Even the shaken Bumstead found it splendid, regretting only the final
paragraph, which, when read aloud, had elicited ""an outburst of dissent""
from half the trustees. It was in that final paragraph that Du Bois had
taken another fateful step on the field of battle. ""As between
\[Trotter\] and Mr. Washington,"" the author of [The Souls of Black
Folk]{.epub-i} declared, ""I unhesitatingly believe Mr. Trotter to be far
nearer the right."" Du Bois wished only for more restraint and better
judgment on the part of Trotter in order ""to save to our cause his
sincerity and unpurchasable soul in these days when every energy is
being used to put black men back into slavery and when Mr. Washington is
leading the way backward."" In tones of gravest regret over Du Bois's
""unfrank and vague words,"" Peabody advised Du Bois that he was ""in too
important a relation to your race to indulge
them.""[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-11){#cha-11}

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

A [FEW]{.epub-sc} weeks before the Atlanta University commotion, Du Bois
had been wondering what to make of an October 28 letter from Tuskegee.
After completely ignoring the project for months, the Wizard had written
to solicit Du Bois's approval of the plans and invitation list for a
January 1904 conference of key African-American leaders to be held in
New York City. Du Bois was urged to recommend changes or additional
names. On November 8, a more detailed communiquÃ© arrived from Tuskegee,
reiterating the pressing need to ""agree upon certain fundamental
principles and to see in what way we understand or misunderstand each
other."" It might have been an encouraging overture, but the Wizard's
heavy-handedness was too apparent. The list of proposed conferees was
filled either with converts or Bookerite beneficiaries. ""The more I
think of it, the more I feel convinced,"" Washington would insist
whenever Du Bois suggested names, that this or that person decidedly had
to be added to or deleted from the list. Too many men from the North
would be a mistake, of course, because ""the bulk of our people are in
the South."" His own suggestions were entirely reasonable, Washington
insisted, and he advised Du Bois to make ""a special effort to drop out
of consideration all personal feelings."" By mid-November, Du Bois had
become thoroughly disgusted and Tuskegee was worried. Did he have more
suggestions? Could he be counted on to attend? a worried Washington
telegraphed Du Bois. The undated reply from Atlanta was frosty. Du Bois
did not think it would ""be profitableÂ ... to give further advice which
will not be followed. The conference is yours and you will naturally
constitute it as you choose."" After seeing the final list, he would
decide then ""whether \[his\] own presence is worth
while.""[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-12){#cha-12}

Du Bois was turning the tables on Washington, and Washington sensed that
if he failed to coopt or neutralize this score of articulate, mutinous,
mostly northern college graduates, he would sooner rather than later
become merely one among several leaders. The power to make and unmake
careers (even those of white men desirous of presidential favor), his
near monopoly over the philanthropic monies assigned to his people, his
stewardship of their civil liberties and of their broad agenda for
advancement---all would collapse into relative insignificance if he
failed to discipline the upstart celebrity Du Bois and his admirers.
""There are about fifteen colored people who practically control the
public sentiment of the Negro race,"" the Wizard had told Baldwin in a
letter dated October 26, 1903, explaining the need for the New York
conference. Having ""thought it over pretty carefully for some time,"" the
conference was the most effective way of bringing things back under
control. ""What do you think of the plan?"" Baldwin had not been sure.
With the SEB's spineless Murphy warning that he had ""never seen so much
sentiment against the Negro,"" Baldwin, Ogden, and Buttrick seem to have
decided against the New York conference because of probable southern
white opposition. Faced with Baldwin's veto and abject humiliation
before his own followers as well as the dissenters, Washington's
biographer Louis Harlan thinks the Wizard finally lost his temper. ""I
think I owe you an apology for the manner in which I spoke to Mr.
Baldwin over the telephone concerning the conference,"" said a letter
hurried off to Buttrick in early November. His leadership was at stake,
Washington explained. Buttrick, Baldwin, and Ogden would simply have to
accept his judgment that ""we have already gone as far as decency permits
in our attempt to avoid stirring up southern
feeling.""[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-13){#cha-13}

The conference was now definitely on, set for January 6--8, 1904, in the
meeting rooms at Carnegie Hall, with Baldwin, Ogden, Buttrick, and other
arbitral whites pledged to attend briefly. Baldwin stood the Wizard to
an extra thousand dollars expense money ""until February."" Du Bois,
however, still refused to commit himself. Without his participation the
Carnegie Hall conference would lose much of its raison d'Ãªtre. But
Washington gambled that Du Bois could not afford to be saddled with the
blame for an aborted meeting. A test of nerves ensued in a game of
epistolary poker, with Du Bois resisting the latest names proposed by
Washington and raising several new ones himself, and vice versa, and
both men threatening to refuse to play another hand. He wished ""we could
invite them, but \[Washington\] hesitate\[d\] because of the fear of
making the conference too large."" As for Francis GrimkÃ©'s brother,
Archibald, a distinguished Boston attorney and President Cleveland's
former consul to the Dominican Republic, Tuskegee objected that ""we have
already invited one prominent Democrat."" Furthermore, Boston must not
have ""an undue representation."" William Lewis could represent Boston
adequately, and possibly Clement Morgan, Du Bois's old classmate.
Trotter and Forbes were anathema to the Wizard. On the other hand, for
appearance's sake, he not only pleaded with Edward H. Morris, the feisty
Chicago attorney who had denounced him as a racial sellout, to come to
New York, but offered to pay his
way.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-14){#cha-14}

Less than two weeks before the conference, Du Bois sent an important
confidential memorandum to his allies. Although Washington was kept
guessing until the last minute, its contents left no doubt that Du Bois
intended to be present at Carnegie Hall, but he and they had to be ready
for devious parliamentary gambits and deceptive reasonableness. Those
who stood with him had to come with the bottom-line resolve to fight for
full, candid criticism of the Wizard on suffrage, officeholding, civil
rights, and college and industrial training according to ability. The
number of participants had risen from twenty to a final twenty-eight,
with Du Bois able to count solidly on no more than four (Clement Morgan,
Edward Morris, Frederick L. McGhee, a Minnesota attorney, and, as an
eleventh-hour Tuskegee concession, Archibald GrimkÃ©). Another four or
five, perhaps, belonged to the Miller camp of straddlers. Come prepared
to ""keep a good temper and insist on free speech,"" Du Bois warned. They
should not allow cloture, and if the proceedings became too underhanded,
they had to be ready to protest ""even to the extent of leaving the
meeting."" Those who had incriminating documents---""every speech or
letter or record of Washington""---should bring them so that the Wizard
can ""face his record in print."" ""The main issue of this meeting,"" Du
Bois pointed out, ""is [Washington,]{.epub-i} refuse to be
side-tracked.""[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-15){#cha-15} All
anti--Booker Washington men were to assemble in New York on the eve of
the conference, Tuesday night, where Du Bois would meet and brief them
further. He had been stood the price of his round-trip ticket by the
Wizard.

Du Bois's suspicions of a cabal more powerful than his own were
confirmed the first day. As he remembered it five decades later, he and
Booker Washington had ridden together uptown on the Madison Avenue
trolley to Carnegie's Georgian mansion on Riverside Drive before the
conference opened at ten o'clock that morning. As they stood together at
the back of the car, Washington, ""who very seldom said anything,"" turned
to Du Bois and asked, ""Have you read Carnegie's book \[[The Gospel of
Wealth]{.epub-i}\]?"" Du Bois said he had never thought it worthwhile to
do so. ""You ought to read it,"" the Wizard gravely advised. ""He likes
it."" Du Bois pondered these words as they walked to Carnegie's, where,
after retiring to the philanthropist's bedchamber for a brief
discussion, the Wizard rejoined Du Bois in the anteroom, saying
importantly ""Mr. Carnegie is coming to address
us.""[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-16){#cha-16} Carnegie's money
having paid for the conference, it was both courtesy and politics for
the tiny personification of the Age of Steel to appear before this
gathering of black leaders whose total assets, had they been tabulated
that afternoon, probably would not have amounted to the cost of one of
his smaller libraries. The fifty-odd black and white men who finally
assembled at Carnegie Hall listened respectfully as the great benefactor
praised Booker Washington and stressed the unerring wisdom of the Great
Accommodator's policies, signalling in accents of stern Scots
practicality the chaos certain to engulf those who challenged or
deserted. The patronizing Lyman Abbott followed with more praise and
warnings. Since no written record was made of the conference, exactly
what was said is speculative. But the intentions of Ogden, Baldwin,
Peabody, Villard, and William Hayes Ward, editor of the
[Independent,]{.epub-i} were obvious. Having delivered their message of
compliance, the whites hurried off to boardrooms and banks with fulsome
injunctions that the blacks should deliberate in the freest and most
honest manner. ""Even if all they said had been true,"" Du Bois thought,
""it was a wrong note to strike in a conference of
conciliation.""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-17){#cha-17}

In the plain speaking that took place on Thursday and Friday, tempers
and suspicions occasionally flared around the meeting room, as when a
Bookerite charged that the letter Clement Morgan was writing to his wife
was a secret transcript of the deliberations. But as the hours wore on,
a tone of compromise prevailed. Washington superbly played Solon for the
occasion, adopting a pose of such reasonableness that Du Bois lost the
undivided support of Archibald GrimkÃ©, while the ever-undecided Miller
began to lean toward the Wizard. In the closing speeches both men
delivered, the Wizard's practiced mixture of earthy humor and group
psychology served him better than Du Bois's dry intellectual appeal to
principles. There were newspaper reports of a statement by Washington,
apparently not for public dissemination, that he favored ""absolute
civil, political, and public equality,"" and that he generously applauded
the principle of higher education for the elite. For their part, the Du
Boisians were said to have conceded that the great majority of
African-Americans should remain in the South, and that the education of
the masses should be confined to industrial training. Both factions
agreed to support lawsuits to protect and expand access to public
accommodations and the ballot box (Baldwin had offered to finance them);
specifically, a test case was to be initiated against the Pullman
Company's Jim Crow policies in Tennessee. By unanimous vote, the
conferees created a ""Committee of Safety with twelve members,"" a sort of
executive body of national leadership, charged with harmonizing,
guiding, and communicating race policy and tactics. Washington and Du
Bois were charged to organize the Committee of Twelve, along with Hugh
Browne, now principal of a Pennsylvania teacher-training college for
African-Americans and a man Du Bois mistakenly believed to be critical
of the Tuskegee
Machine.[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-18){#cha-18}

Du Bois must have left Carnegie Hall with a far clearer sense of his own
limitations within a group setting as well as of the inevitability of
conflict with Tuskegee. And when the time came that he could no longer
delay a declaration of war, he saw himself being maneuvered into facing
Booker Washington and his numerous troops on the field of battle with
barely even a squad to command. Morris of Chicago was the exception,
returning to the charge after Carnegie Hall, denouncing the Wizard in
even hotter language as a fraud and a tool in the hands of white
racists. Courtly Archibald GrimkÃ©, however, was typical of those who
went about praising Washington's Carnegie Hall address as
""unanswerable."" Du Bois heard that GrimkÃ© no longer doubted that the
Wizard was ""working for the best interests of the Negro."" The uninvited
Trotter was undeceived, of course, but the shrill predictableness of his
editorials undermined their influence. The Wizard himself was cautiously
pleased with the results of the conference, reporting to Baldwin that
his opponents were ""either silenced or won over to see the error of
their way."" Du Bois was still a major annoyance, and the Wizard advised
his ally Robert Russa Moton of Hampton against inviting the Atlanta
professor to campus for a private meeting. He suspected Du Bois was
simply looking for more ammunition to fire against the Tuskegee
Machine.[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-19){#cha-19}

Meanwhile, Du Bois found himself locked into a troika with two members
primed to exploit whatever cooperation he undertook. The understanding
at Carnegie Hall had been that he, Washington, and Browne were to meet
in New York in February or March to plan the membership and structure of
the Committee of Twelve. Without much faith that it would be adopted, he
drafted a four-page proposal in late February that would have
transformed the Committee of Twelve into a genuinely national body with
a broad base in the African-American leadership community. His Committee
of Safety would have numbered approximately 120, nationally recruited
from all factions and regions, and comprised of six subdivisions: public
action; legal redress; social reform; information and defense; economic
cooperation; and organization and finance. The twelve original members
would function as an executive committee, meeting quarterly. There was
more for Browne and the Wizard to mull over: a ""Committee of
Correspondence"" branching throughout the nation even as far as the
smallest towns in which there were black communities; its major task
would be the drumming up of a \$12,000 annual ""relief fund"" for
lawsuits, propaganda, and
staffing.[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-20){#cha-20} Here lay the
roots of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
still years away, and also next year's Niagara Movement. At that point
in time, the plan was probably too grandiose to be practical, but it had
undeniable visionary value for those African-Americans with influence
who were dedicated to civil rights.

His proposal drew a response that Du Bois must have anticipated. Booker
Washington praised its long-range desirability, then followed up with a
characteristic demurral. ""The more I think of it,"" the more he thought
it best to wait a year or so to see how the twelve-member body panned
out. Imagine trying to deal with large numbers of colored people all at
once, he commented to Hugh Browne by letter a few days later. As Du Bois
suspected they would, the Wizard and Browne excluded him from
preparations for the Committee of Twelve planning meeting, shifting the
venue from New York to St. Louis, then finally back to New York for July
6. Du Bois had already decided that the Wizard's gambit was to ""have me
at his mercy by simply having his men out vote me,"" as he told the
waffling Archibald GrimkÃ© and Kelly
Miller.[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-21){#cha-21} He was not yet
quite ready to resign, but ""The Parting of the Ways"" salvo from the
April issue of [World Today]{.epub-i} made his exit from the Committee
of Twelve a mere formality.

Refusing to ""kiss the hands that smite us,"" Du Bois's article disparaged
the Tuskegee program and served up a biting parody of the Wizard's
wisdom: ""The trimmings of life, smatterings of Latin and music and such
stuff---let us wait till we are rich. Then as to voting, what is the
good of it after all? Politics does not pay as well as the grocery
business, and breeds trouble."" For their children's sake let black men
and women fight for full citizenship, Du Bois countered, ""and if they
fail, die trying."" With even more fervor, he prepared an address to the
graduating class of Washington, D.C.'s elite M Street High School that
June (not delivered for some reason) in which he flayed the lies ""sprung
from the father of lies."" They must know that ""there are men who are
afraid that they will know too much, wield too much power and aspire to
too great position; that therefore they are seeking to cut down the
opportunities of education."" Kelly Miller wrung his hands over ""The
Parting of the Ways,"" as well as the evidence of equally bad faith on
the part of the Wizard, asking, ""Is it war to the knife, and knife to
the hilt?"" Du Bois would provide a definitive answer soon after the
Committee of Twelve was set up in New York. Nina telegraphed from
Atlanta that he was ill, which was true, but he was more fed up than
sick.[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-22){#cha-22} But the Wizard
was also fed up. This time, the boss in Booker Washington controlled his
behavior. Whatever had been said by way of conciliation at the January
Carnegie Hall conclave was a dying letter, if not yet completely dead.
There had been a vintage Lincoln's Birthday Address at Madison Square
Garden, in mid-February, with Washington yet again extolling the
educational superiority of Hampton-Tuskegee. ""For my race one of its
dangers,"" he bellowed into the great arena, ""is that it may grow
impatient and feel that it can get upon its feet by artificial and
superficial efforts rather than by slower but surer progressÂ ... of
industrial, mental, moral and social
development.""[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-23){#cha-23}

""He is whipped oftenest who is whipped easiest,"" advised Charles
(""Charlie"") William Anderson, chief accountant for the New York State
Racing Commission, and one of the Wizard's craftiest recruits. Charlie
Anderson was northern-born, light-skinned, bluff, tough, and self-made.
His heavyweight political talents were soon to be rewarded through the
Wizard with a plum appointment from Teddy Roosevelt as collector of
internal revenue for the Second District in New York City. By the time
of the July meeting, Washington hardly needed Charlie Anderson to tell
him to be himself and take charge. He whipped the New York meeting into
line, getting himself elected chairman, the devious Browne secretary,
and the credulous GrimkÃ© treasurer of a Bookerite-packed Committee of
Twelve for the Advancement of the Interests of the Negro Race. Du Bois
and Miller were included for the sake of form. But the bald manipulation
actually proved too much for GrimkÃ© after a few days' reflection.
Submitting his resignation, he complained to Du Bois, ""There was nothing
for men like ourselves to do in such a Committee."" In late July, a
circular sent by Hugh Browne dropped the importance of higher education
acknowledged at Carnegie Hall, as well as the ""paramount importance"" of
the ballot. Instead, there was to be a conference of white men from the
South and North, together with an equivalent group of southern and
northern black men, to ""consider race conditions."" When the final
program of the Twelve was released a few weeks later, even a mild
addendum on voting had vanished. Finally, due to the delays and evasions
of everyone but himself (""I would say that I have done everything I
could to get such a suit started""), the Wizard despaired of ever being
in a position to challenge the segregation policies of the Pullman
Company in court. Du Bois received the Wizard's rather lame explanation
that ""Mr. Baldwin wanted us to wait until he could have the opportunity
to have a conference with Robert T. Lincoln himself""---the same Lincoln
who had icily rebuffed earlier approaches. After much delay, Washington
claimed he had urged his associates in Nashville to proceed, ""but there
is a failure to act so
far.""[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-24){#cha-24}

Resigning from the Committee of Twelve a month after the July 1904 New
York meeting, Du Bois went off to swim in different waters. Looking
back, he sighed that the Committee of Twelve scheme initially had
""seemed to me of some value, but of no lasting importance and having
little to do with the larger questions and issues."" The committee would
flow on through 1907 and part of 1908, its course dominated by Tuskegee,
but with Miller and GrimkÃ© (having rescinded his resignation) swimming
vainly upstream. ""I have actually found people who seemed to suppose
that you and Trotter were working together,"" Hart wrote his favorite
student in disbelief. But in fact that was precisely what Du Bois had in
mind. There was no turning back now for Du Bois, no more socially
correct sojourns at Tuskegee, no further charades of compromise and
cooperation. As Miller (who continued to profess not to understand Du
Bois's reasoning) had lamented, ""It was war to the knife, and knife to
the hilt."" [The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i} had examined the ideas of
Washington and found the best of them to be flawed, but with ""The
Parting of the Ways"" and his withdrawal from the Twelve, Du Bois began
to impugn the man behind the message. He was discovering a truth that
Washington had known his entire, calculating life---that the force of an
idea, at least in the short term, is only as good as the politics of the
people advancing it. He thought he finally understood Booker Washington
completely, grasped his remorseless opportunism: ""'Now what is your
racket? What are you out for?'"" And as he reflected, Du Bois came to
appreciate how puzzling his own behavior was to Washington. ""You see, he
couldn't quite think of me as a man with purely scholastic ambitions,""
Du Bois mused many years later. ""There must be something else. He was a
terribly suspicious
man.""[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-25){#cha-25} To get at the
Wizard's ideas, Du Bois now saw that he would have to cripple the man.

In a scolding letter to GrimkÃ© and Miller, accusing them of being caught
up in an intellectual exercise that merely amused the men in the
Tuskegee Machine, Du Bois draped himself in the mantle of a solitary,
cocky David:

I count it a clear misfortune to the Negro race when two clear-headed
and honest men like you can see their way to put themselves under the
dictation of a man with the record of Mr. Washington. I am sorry, very
sorry to see it. Yet it will not alter my determination one jot or
tittle. I refuse to wear Mr. Washington's livery or put on his collar. I
have worked this long without having my work countersigned by Booker
Washington or laid out by Robert Ogden, and I think I'll peg along to
the end in the same
way.[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-26){#cha-26}

If he was to bring down the most powerful black symbol in American
society, Du Bois now knew he would have to construct a formidable
symbolism of his own, both captivating and candid. The politics of ideas
boiled down to strategies of public relations and propaganda, especially
for the party whose resources of money and numbers were inferior.
Millions of Americans thought they knew what Booker Washington's beliefs
were. It was time for Du Bois to broadcast his own---eloquently,
succinctly. Like so much else that he wrote, the ""Credo"" was meant to
serve a dual purpose: manifesto to a few thousand influential whites
outlining the social and civil rights ideals Du Bois and his few
supporters embodied; and catechism for great numbers of ordinary men and
women of his race whose beleaguered pride was faltering. His mood must
have been especially reflective as he wrote this powerful piece at his
South Hall desk, with the October 2 anniversary of Burghardt's death
just a few days away.

The nine-paragraph ""Credo"" was published by editor William Ward
(sympathetic to Tuskegee but, like Villard, not uncritical) in the
edition of the [Independent]{.epub-i} for October 6, 1904. Du Bois
sprinkled it with pieties about peace and beauty and
goodness---patience, even---and appeared to profess a belief in God and
spoke of green pastures beside still waters, for he especially needed to
persuade a white public schooled in the black world by [Up From
Slavery]{.epub-i} that he was not a rash and godless intellectual, but a
committed exponent of Judeo-Christian harmony and justice. ""Credo"" was a
majestic incantation whose surface and subliminal meanings were easily
misread. White readers of a sanctimonious or myopic bent were profoundly
gratified by the expression of religious sentiments, as were the
overwhelming majority of his own people. Perceptive readers, on the
other hand, heard, in a staccato modeled on Zola's [J'accuse,]{.epub-i}
distinct sounds of white supremacy crumbling. A good many black people
heard the thunder of avenging racial parity. They would hang the ""Credo""
on their living room walls after Du Bois included it in
[Darkwater]{.epub-i} sixteen years later, just as their grandchildren
would mount ""I Have a Dream"" on theirs.

He believed in God, he began, ""in God who made of one blood all races
that dwell on earth."" He believed that ""all men, black and brown and
white, are brothers, varying through Time and Opportunity, in form and
gift and features, but differing in no essential particular, and alike
in soul and in the possibility of infinite development."" ""Especially do
I believe in the Negro Race,"" ""Credo"" sang in the key of destiny, ""in
the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul and its strength in
that meekness which shall yet inherit this turbulent earth."" Sweetness
and meekness but also and equally ""pride of race."" He believed in
""lineage and selfÂ ... so deep as to scorn injustice to other selves; in
pride of lineage so great as to despise no man's father; in pride of
race so chivalrous as neither to offer bastardy to the weak nor beg
wedlock of the strong. Knowing that men may be brothers in Christ, even
they be not brothers-in-law."" The seventh paragraph disclosed the
immediate agenda: ""I believe in Liberty for all men; the space to
stretch their arms and souls; the right to breathe and the right to
vote, the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine and ride
on the railroads, uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they
will in a kingdom of God and
love.""[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-27){#cha-27} ""God has gifted
you,"" rejoiced the Reverend Francis GrimkÃ©, whose views of the Wizard
were less patient than his brother's. ""Credo"" was what was ""need\[ed\]
today more than anything else."" ""It makes me ache with anger at one's
own impotence,"" sighed Mary Ovington in a letter written to Du Bois
early on in their lifelong friendship. ""Credo"" would be widely reprinted
in the African-American press and made available on cardboard rectangles
slightly larger than playing-card size by a Memphis printing
establishment.[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-28){#cha-28}

Despite the biblical allusions in ""Credo,"" however, Du Bois was far from
successful when it came to reassuring conventional white liberals that
he might not be willing to overturn their society in order to advance
the condition of black people. Twelve days after its appearance, he
surprised the genteel delegates to the American Missionary Association
conclave in Des Moines, Iowa, by declaring from the podium, in language
widely reported in the press as ""menacingly"" socialist, that the race
problem ""was but the sign of growing class privilege and caste
distinction in America, and not, as some fondly imagine, the cause of
it."" He seemed to be giving voice to Caroline Pemberton, who had
qualified her admiration for [The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i} by
regretting its failure to stress the primacy of class to race; but it
was the first flash of a recurring insight, rather than the beginning of
a philosophical revision. His letter to a prominent socialist and
welfare specialist, who had been intrigued by news reports that Du Bois
had advocated class warfare, is an excellent measure of his thinking
then. While he would ""scarcely describe \[him\]self as a socialist,"" he
explained to Isaac Max Rubinow of Washington, D.C., still he had much
sympathy with the movement and had ""many socialistic
beliefs.""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-29){#cha-29} The
absorbing problem of the hour, he believed, was the abject racial
discrimination against black people in America---and the collusion with
oppression that Booker T. Washington called compromise.

I[N THE]{.epub-sc} January 1905 issue of the new African-American
magazine [Voice of the Negro,]{.epub-i} Du Bois wrote an article titled
""Debit and Credit, The American Negro in the Year of Grace Nineteen
Hundred and Four."" [Voice of the Negro]{.epub-i} was an aggressive,
year-old monthly skillfully edited by a young Virginia Union University
graduate named Jesse Max Barber. The reaction to ""Debit and Credit""
caught Du Bois off guard. Taking a hip shot at the Wizard, he had made
the shocking allegation that the Tuskegee Machine had spent three
thousand dollars during the previous year in bribes to the press. Du
Bois suddenly found himself caught in a blistering crossfire from
Tuskegee admirers. The [Independent]{.epub-i}'s William Ward politely
but firmly demanded proof of the newspaper ""hush money"" story, warning
Du Bois that it was ""unpleasant to find one whom we so heartily respect
as you should be losing the sympathy of the colored people, as if you
had been guilty of a slander."" Only those who already belonged to the
""Syndicate"" disbelieved his charge, Du Bois assured Ward, but washing
""our dirty linen in public"" was unwise and so Du Bois had promised that,
unless forced to do otherwise by later developments, he would ""say
nothing further in print on the subject."" Oswald Villard had not been
put off so easily, complaining that to level ""so grave a charge"" against
the Wizard was to libel the work of the most influential men and women
in America. ""Kindly let us have the facts for publication in the
[Evening Post,]{.epub-i}"" he commanded. Although Du Bois had been
certain that he was right, urgent letters to Trotter asking for ""every
scrap of evidence you haveÂ ... by return mail"" prove that evidence had
unscientifically followed hypothesis in this
instance.[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-30){#cha-30}

Having behaved impetuously, Du Bois very nearly compounded his
embarrassment by assailing Villard for daring to doubt him. ""You do not
realize the fight for sheer existence that the American Negro is today
waging,"" he had retorted in the first draft of his letter. ""You do not
realize the underground and persistent series of attacks being made on
him. I am sorry to see you disposed to dismiss the plaint of some of us
who are fighting in the open for justice."" Fortunately, he decided
against sending an indignant reply, settling instead for a short,
courteous refusal of the [Evening Post]{.epub-i}'s offer, assuring
Villard of his readiness ""to furnish for your personal information the
nature of the proof."" Meanwhile President Bumstead had implored his
stellar faculty member to consider more carefully the ramification of
his accusations. Even if they could be ""morally certain"" that Booker
Washington had bought much of the black press and influenced federal
appointments based on loyalty to Tuskegee, Bumstead thought it would be
""almost impossible to prove to the satisfaction of skeptics."" And was it
worth the cost? Villard had become much more sympathetic to Atlanta
University lately, partly thanks to Du Bois's writings. The worried
president had suggested bearing in mind that the wealthy publisher was
""in a position to render us much help, personally, through his paper and
by his relation to the men of the General Education Board and the Slater
Fund Trust.""[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-31){#cha-31}

Finally, on March 24, 1905, Villard received from Du Bois a lengthy
document with numerous subparagraphs and exhibits intended to prove the
[Voice of the Negro]{.epub-i} charges. He had made a strong,
circumstantial case (strong but not overwhelming), but Villard decided
that ""franklyÂ ... it will take a great deal more than the evidence you
have presented to shake my faith in Mr. Washington's purity of purpose.""
The mere fact that that ""very dangerous, and almost irresponsible young
man,"" Trotter (Villard had known him well at Harvard), had supplied Du
Bois with evidence was almost [prima facie]{.epub-i} grounds for
dismissing the charges. At that, Villard's reaction had been better than
most---he had at least conceded that the conduct of Emmett Scott's
Tuskegee literary bureau had been ""extremely injudicious,"" even as he
maintained that Du Bois had utterly failed to substantiate the Wizard's
""use of political patronage."" Du Bois could not have known that
Villard's uncle, Francis Garrison, upon returning Du Bois's letter and
exhibits to his nephew, had casually mentioned that his wife speculated
that the Wizard drew ""on his personal income (\$7,500) from the Carnegie
gift for this press business."" ""Debit and Credit"" had touched a nerve,
and Du Bois's reply to the powerful publisher's excusing the Wizard and
blaming Scott was tantamount to a rebuke. ""Such actions are not
'injudicious,' Mr. Villard, they are
wrong.""[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-32){#cha-32} Always ready
to lecture others, and unkindly disposed to receiving one---especially
one from an African-American gentleman---Oswald Villard would not soon
forget Du Bois's presumptuousness.

So by early summer of 1905, Du Bois and a handful of others had seen
themselves as much like the figure of Shakespeare's Cassius, lesser
beings darting between the legs of a giant tyrant. The situation was
intolerable to Frederick McGhee and Charles E. Bentley. McGhee had been
born a slave in Monroe County, Mississippi. The respected and
influential Bentley was freeborn, in Cincinnati, and was now the leading
African-American physician in Chicago, where he had played a key role in
founding Provident Hospital, the first hospital in the country owned and
operated by African-Americans. Du Bois called McGhee ""brilliant"" and was
impressed by the tall, sharp-featured Mississippian's ""intense and
eloquent speech."" Somehow McGhee had managed to graduate in 1885 from
what became Northwestern University Law School, then set up practice in
St. Paul, Minnesota, to become one of the city's most successful
criminal lawyers. At forty-four, McGhee, like Bentley, was somewhat
older than the Niagarite average of forty; he was also a staunch
Catholic and a Democrat with a large interracial
clientele.[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-33){#cha-33} An early
member of the Afro-American Council, he had praised the Wizard's
policies at first, but had become disgusted by the logrolling politics
of the 1903 and 1904 meetings of the council. They must do something, he
told Du Bois. Bentley agreed. Du Bois suggested that they convene a
meeting of like-minded men in Buffalo, New York. He wrote to book a bloc
of rooms in one of the city's medium-sized hotels, then set about
drafting a statement of intentions. Drafted and circulated by Du Bois in
early June, the call stated two forthright purposes: ""organized
determination and aggressive action on the part of men who believe in
Negro freedom and growth""; and opposition to ""present methods of
strangling honest criticism."" Those signing represented the vanguard of
the Talented Tenth---educators, lawyers, publishers, physicians,
ministers, and several businessmen secure enough in their professions
and principles to risk Booker Washington's retribution. Du Bois
described them as ""educated, determined, and unpurchasable""---fifty-odd
men he had hoped but doubted he could find who ""had not bowed the knee
to Baal.""[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-34){#cha-34}

The twenty-nine men and one teenage boy who arrived throughout the day
to join Du Bois at the comfortable old Erie Beach Hotel in Ontario, on
July 10, knew they were about to make history. It was the ""beginning of
a new epoch,"" Du Bois proclaimed. The ""Call"" which brought them to the
Canadian side of Niagara Falls that Monday in 1905 had been signed by
fifty-nine men of distinction in the District of Columbia and sixteen
states from Rhode Island to South Carolina and as far west as Kansas.
(The issue of membership for women was to be decided affirmatively the
following year but only after Trotter's opposition had been overcome.)
Fort Erie, on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, had never seen thirty
black people together in the town before. However, from time to time
African-Americans visiting the Falls crossed over, and Fort Erie
townspeople were inclined by tradition and commerce to show them
hospitality. Three days of roast beef dinners served to a filled dining
room at Burnett's Restaurant down the road from the hotel put the
manager and his family in an especially warm mood. Du Bois's tense mood
of the first day was also much better by then. Race prejudice on the
part of the Buffalo hotel establishment had forced the conference
organizer to rush to Fort Erie on the evening of the ninth to arrange
alternate accommodations. Du Bois remembered his extreme agitation: ""If
sufficient men had not come to pay the hotel, I should certainly have
been in bankruptcy and perhaps jail."" In view of the expense, distance,
professional risk, and eleventh-hour confusion, the quorum of
twenty-nine men from every region of the country except the Far West was
a distinct coup for Du Bois and Trotter. Led by Trotter and old Harvard
classmate Morgan, seven of what were to become known thereafter as
Niagarites came from New England. There were eight from the Midwest,
including Charles Bentley, W. L. McGhee, and Harry Clay Smith, editor of
the Cleveland [Gazette.]{.epub-i} Six came from the South, four from the
Middle Atlantic states and from the District of
Columbia.[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-35){#cha-35}

There was irony in the fact that the first collective attempt by
African-Americans to demand full citizenship rights in the twentieth
century (without even indirect support of influential whites) had been
forced to spring to life on Canadian soil. There was also an incidental
advantage to the locale that almost certainly escaped Du Bois at the
time: the spy sent by Booker Washington to report on the Niagarites
looked for them in the wrong place. Boston attorney Clifford Plummer,
enjoying his underwritten sortie, reported to Tuskegee from Buffalo that
he had stationed himself there ""from Wednesday morning until Friday"" and
that ""none of the men named in the report were \[sic\] present except Du
Bois.""[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-36){#cha-36} Plummer was
much more successful in discharging his instructions to prevent any news
coverage of the meeting. Except for the report in the Boston
[Transcript,]{.epub-i} his visit to the Buffalo offices of the
Associated Press resulted in an almost total blackout in the white
press. For its part, the Tuskegee Machine enforced the African-American
press's widespread silence. Outside of the Niagarite circle comprised of
the [Bee,]{.epub-i} the [Guardian,]{.epub-i} the [Gazette,]{.epub-i} and
a few others, the historic meeting went unnoticed. The highly restricted
coverage by race newspapers lent credibility to Du Bois's shocking claim
that the Wizard had spent three thousand dollars during 1904 in bribes
to the press.

The new arrivals at the rambling Erie Beach Hotel were all the more
intriguing due to their impressive livery and comportment. They exuded
an air of self-assurance and professional success, Du Bois with cane and
handlebar mustache; Trotter displaying the nervous energy of Teddy
Roosevelt, whom he resembled from a distance; Edwin Jourdain with the
grace and elegant tailoring befitting his ancient, wealthy New Bedford,
Massachusetts, lineage; William H. Hart, professor of law at Howard
University, who, by demeanor and color, was an illegitimate copy of his
aristocratic, slaveholding Eufala, Alabama, father. Something of their
self-conscious purpose and the impression they must have made upon
Niagara during those four days of ideal July weather was captured in a
photo of many of the Fort Erie group members, which was later
misidentified as dating from 1906. The falls cascade on a mock
background as three rows of men in white Panama hats and Stetsons
(Norris, the boy in the sailor suit, was the son of Georgia Niagarite
Alonzo Herndon) stare straight ahead---although a debonair Du Bois,
obviously pleased with himself, looks off to his right from the second
row.[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-37){#cha-37}

Of the thirty who failed to come to the Canadian side of the Falls,
about half were likely kept away by genuine conflicts in schedule, or by
financial or family problems, rather than by eleventh-hour caution. Such
was the case of Georgians John Hope and George Towns, as well as young
Monroe Work, an incredibly hardworking instructor at the industrial
college in Savannah who held the University of Chicago's first degree in
sociology awarded to an African-American. That inveterate Tuskegee-hater
from Chicago, Edward Morris, and the brilliant young AME minister
Richard R. Wright, Jr., were absent for similar reasons. Ten
Massachusetts men signed the call. Of the five who stayed away, two,
Reverdy Ransom and Charles Burleigh Purvis, were newcomers to the state
who were unlikely to have had manufactured alibis. Ransom, tall,
handsome, theatrical, and already recognized as the AME Church's most
charismatic preacher, would steal the show from Du Bois at the next
Niagara Movement meeting at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. Purvis, a
graduate of Oberlin and Western Reserve University Medical School, was
an authentic aristocrat whose South Carolina--born father had attended
Amherst and raised African-American troops for the Union Army. Charles
Purvis himself had been an officer in the Army Medical Corps during the
Civil War, the first occupant of the Thaddeus Stevens Chair at Howard
University Medical College, and the first physician on the scene to
attend President Garfield after he was mortally shot by Charles Guiteau,
a disgruntled civil servant. Two newspaper publishers notorious for
their independence, New York's John Edward Bruce (""Bruce Grit"") and
Cincinnati's Wendell Dabney, would have had to borrow even to buy the
reduced tickets being offered by the railroads in connection with the
Elks Convention in Buffalo at the same
time.[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-38){#cha-38}

Archibald GrimkÃ© and Kelly Miller were omitted from the invitation list.
To the extreme annoyance of Du Bois, they were still trying to make
something more of the Committee of Twelve than a Bookerite sounding
board. GrimkÃ© and Miller had even presumed to lecture Du Bois about what
seemed to them his arbitrary withdrawal from the Twelve, an impertinence
that Du Bois took with steely grace. Theirs was an attitude that might
have chilled his Talented Tenth conclave, Du Bois decided. ""Because you
both belonged to Mr. Washington's committee,"" he wrote them after the
meeting, their presence at Niagara would have been ""inconsistent""---an
exclusionary attitude the Wizard would have fully understood. There was
glee in Tuskegee over a reported rupture between the two men and Du
Bois, with the Wizard writing Scott from his Massachusetts summer home
of a detailed conversation with GrimkÃ© about Du Bois's ""insult"": ""He
seems more than anxious now to line up with
us.""[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-39){#cha-39} As for Miller,
said the Wizard, he remained as mushy as always.

What brought the Niagara men together were negative attitudes ranging
from unease to enmity toward the Wizard, but even Du Bois cannot have
taken for granted that they would come to common agreement about a
positive agenda. Lafayette Hershaw and Freeman Henry M. Murray were Du
Bois loyalists, men who would place their professional lives at his
service repeatedly and selflessly in the future. Hershaw, a sad-eyed man
with a fuzzy little mustache, was an 1886 Atlanta University graduate.
He had been principal of a segregated Atlanta secondary school before
moving to Washington in the early 1890s to take up a clerical position
in the department of the interior. Suspicions of un-Tuskegeean
activities had fallen upon Hershaw in 1903, and he had nearly been
sacked from his federal position. Murray, an older Niagarite originally
from Cleveland, Ohio, one of two self-educated men in this group of
college graduates, managed the Washington printing company that he and
his brothers owned.[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-40){#cha-40} On
the grounds of the hotel and over meals in Burnett's Restaurant, Hershaw
and Murray pushed the Du Bois line. Twenty-seven-year-old Max Barber,
the youngest Niagarite at Fort Erie, admired Du Bois with an acolyte's
devotion, and Booker Washington would soon make him pay dearly for it.
Barber had naively accepted Washington's suggestion that Emmett Scott
serve as associate editor of the [Voice of the Negro,]{.epub-i} along
with the distinguished Methodist clergyman and professor, John Bowen of
Atlanta, the second African-American after Du Bois to earn a doctorate.
Dismissing Scott's objections and Bowen's qualms, Barber not only opened
his magazine to Du Bois, he would make it the unofficial organ of the
Niagara Movement until he was forced to leave Atlanta in 1906. From then
on, he would be blocked by the Wizard in every attempt to make a new
start until, finally, Barber abandoned journalism and turned to
dentistry.[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-41){#cha-41}

Even in this group, some shared Archibald GrimkÃ©'s aversion to Trotter
as a loose cannon. Clement Morgan, whose oratorical skills had
contributed to his success as a lawyer, came to Niagara Falls ready to
cooperate with his volatile Boston friend, but he had learned from
experience to be wary of Trotter's stubbornness. On this occasion,
though, the firm hand of Du Bois and the exhilarating conviction that
they were making racial history had a pacifying effect on the radical.
Trotter and Du Bois were then on better terms than before or after, the
[Guardian]{.epub-i} editor having been of critical help in the ""Debit
and Credit"" crisis. ""My wife says you are a brick, all you need is a red
head,"" Trotter had good-naturedly ribbed Du Bois at the
time.[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-42){#cha-42} The elegant
Edwin Jourdain, at forty-nine one of the oldest men at the Erie Beach
Hotel, had admired both Du Bois and Trotter from his Boston University
Law School days in the early 1890s. His grand old family home was
popularly known as the New Bedford annex of the Boston radicals.
Reverend Byron Gunner, also a wary Trotter admirer, was noted for a
temper almost as terrible as his. Gunner was a combative Alabamian,
educated at Talladega College, and pastor of a Congregationalist church
in Providence, Rhode Island, that could have been described as another
radical annex. A clear sense of the other Niagarites is elusive,
although it seems reasonable to assume, from what little is known of
them, that the Howard-educated, Howard University law professors Henry
Lewis Bailey, William Hart, and William Henry Richards held views
somewhat to the right of Du
Bois's.[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-43){#cha-43} All were
members of the capital's very proper Bethel Literary Association, a
larger, somewhat less-exclusive institution modeled after the
prestigious but faltering American Negro Academy.

There may have been a few others at Fort Erie like Alonzo F. Herndon,
whose public career marked him as an astute businessman rather than an
activist moved by the radical ideas of the day. A Georgian born into
slavery, with the color and features of a white man, Herndon was about
to parlay a tidy sum---earned from his chain of gleaming barbershops
catering to white Atlantans---into the Atlanta Life Insurance Company.
Within a few years, he would become one of the wealthier men in America,
irrespective of race, his beautifully proportioned, columned mansion a
mise-en-scÃ¨ne for the grand balls the dreamy, gay Norris would host
after his parents' death. Atlanta gossips attributed Mr. Herndon's
presence among the Niagarites to Mrs. Herndon's influence. Adrienne
Herndon---whose life was cut short by a rare disease just as the great
mansion was finished in 1910---was a Gisellelike beauty with raven hair
and ivory skin who taught French at Atlanta University, where a lively
friendship with Du Bois had blossomed. While Nina preferred the confines
of the South Hall apartment where little Yolande's needs and Lizzie
Pingree's gossip engrossed her, Will and Adrienne frequently attended
the closed campus community's social affairs together. Whether or not
there was ever more than friendship with Du Bois, it was widely noticed
that she delighted in his
urbanity.[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-44){#cha-44} In Adrienne
Herndon's large, dark eyes, Booker Washington was a perfect boor.

Well after the final roast beef dinner on Thursday, the men at Niagara
sat haggling and amending at the Erie Beach Hotel. The structure they
imposed on the movement reflected the organizational schema Du Bois had
proposed to Washington for the Committee of Twelve. They decided on an
executive committee comprised of the chairmen of each Niagara state
chapter (to be organized immediately). The Press and Public Opinion
Committee, with Du Bois and Trotter as members, along with the Committee
on Finance, was the most important of the ten special committees
created. Annual membership dues of five dollars were assessed. Du Bois
was elected general secretary and attorney George Jackson of Cincinnati
general treasurer. Working harmoniously with Trotter, Du Bois drafted
the document defining and excoriating the wrongs inflicted because of
race. Fifty-seven years earlier, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott,
and Frederick Douglass had come to Seneca Falls, New York, less than a
hundred miles away on Lake Ontario, to demand equal rights for women and
had drafted the uncompromising ""Declaration of Sentiments."" Man had
endeavored in every way he could, Stanton and Mott charged, ""to destroy
\[woman's\] confidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect,
and to make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life."" No further
indication exists other than the similarity of language that either Du
Bois or Trotter (a reluctant feminist in any case) consciously looked
back to that other small gathering of civil rights pioneers for their
model. Nevertheless, the Niagara ""Declaration of Principles"" appeared to
owe much to a distaff lineage. ""We refuse to allow the impression to
remain that the Negro American assents to inferiority,"" Du Bois and
Trotter declared, that he ""is submissive under oppression and apologetic
before insults. Through helplessness we may submit, but the voice of
protest of ten million Americans must never cease to assail the ears of
their fellows, so long as America is
unjust.""[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-45){#cha-45}

In its final form, the ""Declaration of Principles"" crackled with
indignation and brimmed with imperatives---the language beneath each
upper case heading uncompromising yet disciplined, defiant yet devoid of
hyperbole. The declaration under ""EMPLOYERS AND LABOR UNIONS"" bore Du
Bois's unmistakable imprint. It struck an economic note then rarely
heard among African-American leaders and only infrequently sounded by
the thirty-nine-year-old Du Bois himself:

We hold up for public execration the conduct of two opposite classes of
men: The practice among employers of importing ignorant Negro American
laborers in emergencies, and then affording them neither protection nor
permanent employment; and the practice of labor unions in proscribing
and boycotting and oppressing thousands of their fellow-toilers, simply
because they are black. These methods have accentuated and will
accentuate the war of labor and capital, and they are disgraceful to
both sides.

Those words were drawn from his bombshell Des Moines address to the
American Missionary Association. Labor relations were important, but
""PROTEST"" was at the heart of Niagara, and what protest would mean from
then on, until the reign of Booker Washington ended, Du Bois and Trotter
passionately expounded:

The Negro race in America stolen, ravished and degraded, struggling up
through difficulties and oppression, needs sympathy and receives
criticism; needs help and is given hindrance, needs protection and is
given mob-violence, needs justice and is given charity, needs leadership
and is given cowardice and apology, needs bread and is given a stone.
This nation will never stand justified before God until these things are
changed.

As they boldly redrew guidelines for the future of the African in
America, some of the Niagarites reminded their fellows of the vast debt
(""HELP"") owed to white Americans of Christian and humanitarian
principles---""our fellow men from the abolitionist down to those who
today still stand for equal opportunity and who have given and still
give of their wealth and of their poverty for our advancement."" With the
voting of the ""Constitution and By-Laws of the Niagara Movement,"" a
document inspired by Du Bois's rejected Committee of Twelve proposal,
the first Niagara meeting closed with thanks voted to general secretary
Du Bois and others. The new civil rights organization would be
incorporated in late January
1906.[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-46){#cha-46}

B[OOKER]{.epub-sc} W[ASHINGTON'S]{.epub-sc} case would have been better
served if his machine had been less efficient in opposing the Niagara
Movement. The flow of money, the deluge of cautionary letters, and the
Wizard's own public dismissal of the ""Declaration of Principles"" as so
much idle talk (when he spoke in September 1905 before the annual
meeting of the National Negro Business League), began to strike some of
his white supporters as excessive. At first, Du Bois heard only a ""furor
of the most disconcerting criticism"" and a series of savage personal
attacks; but a slow shift of alliances was under way that would put the
Wizard increasingly on the defensive. The canny educator instantly would
have sensed the earth beginning to move under his feet as he read
Francis Garrison's long, frank letter of September 25, 1905, about
Niagara and other matters. ""On the whole,"" he concluded, Du Bois's
platform ""seemed to \[him\] a very able and forceful presentation, and
one to which \[he\] could heartily subscribe."" Furthermore, Garrison had
not at all liked the Wizard's explanation of the recent Wanamaker
affair---another dinner brouhaha, this one at Saratoga Springs with male
and female members of that socially prominent white family. The Wizard
denied lending his arm to Miss Wanamaker upon entering the dining room,
complaining to the editor of the Montgomery, Alabama,
[Advertiser]{.epub-i} that it was just about impossible to avoid
socializing with white people when in the North. ""I must say that in
tone and substance it seemed to me unworthy of you,"" Garrison sniffed,
""and calculated to delight equally your white detractors at the South
and your colored critics and opponents at the
North.""[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-47){#cha-47}

Ever since Baldwin's disabling brain tumor toward the end of 1904,
things had begun to go slightly out of kilter for the Wizard. When the
Long Island Rail Road president died suddenly the following January, the
Wizard's sense of loss was akin to experiencing the death of an older
brother. In one of his last letters to Baldwin---a long and
uncharacteristically personal one written in May 1904---the Wizard had
unburdened himself. The Ogden Special, packed with happy
philanthropists, had remained at Hampton Institute two full days while
its passengers basked in an ether of humble deference and spirituals. It
had then come to Tuskegee for four perfunctory hours. Invidious
comparisons had been drawn by journalists on board the special, to the
detriment of the Wizard's fiefdom. ""It is wholly untrue that our
students refuse to sing or dislike to sing plantation songs,"" he
protested to Baldwin, or that Tuskegee's students were ""not as
wide-awake and alert as the Hampton students."" The problem was, as he
reminded Baldwin again, that, since not even a distinguished educator
like himself was permitted aboard the special because of race,
misconceptions arose easily.

Washington had reason to feel cruelly mocked. Had he been able to read
Edgar Murphy's doomsday letter to Ogden in March 1904, Washington's
dogged faith in accommodation might have wavered for a terrible hour or
so. ""Poor fellow!"" Murphy sighed, ""I am glad he does not see---and
cannot see---the situation as it
is.""[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-48){#cha-48} There were,
however, situations Washington could see only too clearly. Another of
his white dinner companions was currently a source of considerable
political embarrassment to him. Despite the favorable publicity
surrounding Teddy Roosevelt's refusal to withdraw Dr. Crum's name for
Senate confirmation to the port of Charleston, Du Bois and his Talented
Tenth crowd noisily noticed that the president had appointed fewer
African-Americans to federal positions than had any of his precedessors.
After the 1904 elections, the Wizard had been able to win hardly any
appointments at all. The president's conduct toward the white South
began to signal that the Republican party took Booker Washington and the
black vote for
granted.[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-49){#cha-49}

As Du Bois's battle with Washington intensified, he searched desperately
for a publication to advance the ideology and program of the Talented
Tenth among the general African-American public. Thus far, the
opposition's stranglehold on newspapers and magazines was patent proof
that freedom of the press belonged to those who owned one. Besides the
nationally read New York [Age,]{.epub-i} Indianapolis
[Freeman,]{.epub-i} and numerous other city newspapers trumpeting the
Hampton-Tuskegee line, there was the well-edited [Southern
Workman,]{.epub-i} a monthly published at Hampton, and the homespun ""To
My People,"" the Wizard's regular bulletin from Tuskegee, fairly
saturating the African-American reading market. As early as June 1903,
Du Bois had sounded out the critically acclaimed African-American
novelist Charles Chesnutt on the subject of founding a ""national Negro
journal.""[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-50){#cha-50} Most Negro
publications were little more than ""mediums for hair straightening
advertisements and the personal laudations of 'self-made men,'"" replied
Chesnutt. A reputable publication was needed, but he wondered about the
""question of support.""

Du Bois wondered too, but in March of the following year he took action.
He formed a partnership first with Edward L. Simon, and then with Harry
Pace, both recent Atlanta University graduates, and together they bought
the Memphis printing plant of W. J. Yerby at 163 Beale Street for a
total investment of \$2,734.74. The three men risked their savings to
come up with the funds necessary to buy and reequip the press, but Simon
and Pace, who obviously admired their former professor a great deal,
risked their livelihoods. Simon resigned his teaching post at Lemoyne
College in Memphis to run the press on a monthly salary of sixty
dollars, and Pace a few months later left his instructorship at a small
Georgia institute to become business manager. Having invested his own
money in the plant, which by December 1904 had earned more than thirteen
hundred dollars from printing contracts, Du Bois had some reason to
expect encouragement from philanthropic whites. ""The present is a very
critical time for the American Negro,"" he told prospective backers.
""Certain ideals, racial and cultural, must be brought home to the rank
and file.""[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-51){#cha-51}

Financier Jacob Schiff, on whom he pinned high hopes, had replied
cordially in early April 1905. Schiff ""well remember\[ed\] our meeting
in Bar Harbor"" in summer 1903. Du Bois's proposal was ""interesting"" and
had his ""sympathy."" Before deciding whether he ought to part with ten
thousand dollars, however, the Wall Street financier asked for
permission to show Du Bois's letter to men ""whose opinion in such a
matter I consider of much value."" In granting him permission, Du Bois
was certain that the much-valued opinion Schiff would seek resided at
Tuskegee. Before Schiff's reply came, Du Bois wrote another Bar Harbor
acquaintance, the dictionary publisher George Merriam, about his plans
for a magazine and expressed the hope that his publication could avoid
being ""knocked promptly on the head"" by the Wizard. Finally, in January
1906, Schiff turned Du Bois down; Washington almost certainly had
thought poorly of the
proposal.[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-52){#cha-52} Still
hopeful, Du Bois approached Isaac N. Seligman, a progressive financier,
asking unsuccessfully for half the amount he had requested of Schiff. ""I
have begun to publish,"" he told Seligman. ""I have already begun and I am
sending samples."" But when it came down to a choice between Du Bois and
Washington, not even Isaac Seligman contemplated breaking ranks with his
fellow capitalists. Meanwhile, old traveling companion John Dollar sent
an admiring, chatty letter. Du Bois had hinted broadly to Dollar about a
loan of two hundred (whether in pounds or dollars was ambiguous) if
Dollar were ""rolling in wealth (as no doubt you are)."" The money would
be as safe as the Bank of England's, Du Bois bantered, because he and
two ""modest"" partners ""planned \[for the publication\] to become the
periodical of the century."" Dollar missed ""dear old Burghardt,"" and the
""glorious Italian sun"" they had shared, and expressed amazement that his
American friend kept up his spirits ""after all you have gone through,""
but Dollar appears not to have sent
money.[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-53){#cha-53}

[The Moon Illustrated Weekly]{.epub-i} made its debut on December 2,
1905. It was the first illustrated weekly in Afro-America, with
illustrations that look as though they might have been drawn by the
editor. The Guardian Real Estate Company (""Lots for Sale to Good Colored
People Only""), Union Painless Dentists (""Welcomes Colored Patients""),
the Leland Pressing Club (""all work guaranteed""), Atlanta Mutual
Insurance Association (A. F. Herndon, president), and about a half dozen
other Memphis and Atlanta businesses were to be mainstay advertisers. It
seemed more than reasonable to editor Du Bois to suppose that of the
fifty thousand black people in Memphis and sixty thousand in Atlanta,
[The Moon's]{.epub-i} other distribution point, many would sign up for a
five-cent publication (averaging less than ten pages) intended to
stimulate ""wide self-knowledge within the race."" Only four of a run of
thirty-four issues have survived, and the first issues for December 1905
are among the missing (publication ceased either in July or early August
1906).[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-54){#cha-54}

Du Bois grouped [The Moon]{.epub-i}'s materials under resonant captions
such as ""Along the Color Line,"" ""Whirl of the World,"" ""Tidings of the
Darker Millions,"" and ""The Man in the Moon."" With Du Bois selecting or
writing most of its copy, weekly subject matter included both domestic
(paving roads in Fort Smith, Arkansas; an Oswald Villard high school
address in Washington, D.C.; a race riot in Springfield, Ohio; the
novelist Lew Wallace's alleged African ancestry; Alabama
disfranchisement) and international (commercial, political, or racial
developments in Barbados, Liberia, and Zululand) events. [The
Moon]{.epub-i} for March 2 was dedicated to the memory of Paul Laurence
Dunbar, Du Bois's friend from Wilberforce days who had died of
consumption in early February---""a writer of true and catholic feeling
and inspiration."" Each issue reprinted a broad range of editorials on
civil rights and labor topics drawn from newspapers throughout the North
and South. There was news of the new Constitution League organized
principally by New York businessman John Milholland; of the opposition
of Massachusetts African-Americans to a state appropriation for the
segregated 1907 Jamestown Exposition tercentenary; of the Negrophobe
ravings of Mississippi's Vardaman; of disfranchisement in Alabama and
Georgia; as well as of much that held local or professional
appeal.[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-55){#cha-55}

Just three months after Du Bois, Simon, and Pace founded their weekly,
one of the now-missing issues must have reported (as had Barber's [Voice
of the Negro]{.epub-i}) on a Deep South gathering that would have been
barely conceivable a few years earlier, the first annual meeting that
February of the Georgia Equal Rights Convention. Two hundred
African-American delegates from the state's eleven congressional
districts assembled at Macon under the guidance of William J. White,
that racially indeterminate civil rights firebrand from Augusta; John
Hope; Max Barber; Bishop Henry M. Turner, the voice of black emigration;
Du Bois; and eight others. The delegates were respectful of Washington's
accomplishments, but they applauded and approved the adoption of an
address by Du Bois that was tantamount to a militant manifesto in the
heart of Georgia. ""We do not desire association with any who do not wish
our company,"" he proclaimed from the rostrum, ""but we do expect in a
Christian, civilized land, to live under a system of law and order, to
be secure in life and limb and property, to travel in comfort and
decency and to receive a just equivalent for our money."" Furthermore,
although ""some of us are not yet fit for the ballot,"" Du Bois swore that
most were, that none of the Jim Crow laws could withstand scrutiny, and
that he and the two hundred men at Macon would insist on full civil
rights for their
people.[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-56){#cha-56}

How many readers [The Moon]{.epub-i} attracted can only be guessed at,
but they almost surely numbered in the hundreds rather than the
thousands. Yet [The Moon]{.epub-i} turned the heat up higher and higher
on the Wizard. The piece ""Then and Now,"" in May 1906, presented a dismal
balance sheet. Noting that the [Age]{.epub-i} had drawn a parallel
between hard times the race experienced under the leadership of
Frederick Douglass and those of the present, Du Bois was at his
trenchant best in demolishing Fortune's casuistry. Under Douglass there
had been the Klan, race riots, the end of Reconstruction, ballot fraud,
adverse court decisions, and the first separate passenger-train laws.
Hardly a triumphant legacy, it was true, but what had come with the
ascendancy of the Wizard? asked Du Bois: Separate passenger trains in
nine states, disfranchisement in six states, annual lynchings by the
hundred. Finally, public opinion in the North had virtually ceded civil
rights to the white South. Could readers imagine Frederick Douglass or
John Mercer Langston, another towering leader of the period after
Reconstruction, telling African-Americans ""not to worry over 'Jim Crow'
cars but to proceed to buy up railways?"" Or that ballot fraud ""was an
encouragement to industry?"" ""But granted all these heavy calamities are
not wholly or even mainly due to the leadership of the last quarter
century,"" Du Bois conceded as he moved in for the kill, ""can Mr. Fortune
say of Mr. Washington what he so justly says of Mr. Douglass?"" Had
Booker Washington ""stood before this bewildered, crushed and outraged
race as 'a champion always great, eloquent and
dignified'?""[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-57){#cha-57} Du Bois
assumed that merely to pose these questions obliged a categorical
negative.

""We need faith,"" [The Moon]{.epub-i} for June 23, 1906, exhorted.
""Particularly is this true among the thinking classes."" The thinking
classes were promised a major reconsecration of faith when the Niagara
Movement held its next meeting. Du Bois and his associates selected a
time and place for that meeting that resounded with significance in the
history of black peoples' struggles: Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, on
August 15--18---a meeting fitly celebrating ""the 100th anniversary of
John Brown's birth, and the 50th jubilee of the battle of Osawatomie.
Rates for board will not exceed \$1 per day."" The month before,
Trotter's stiff opposition to the admission of women to the movement
(and specifically to the admission of one of the GrimkÃ© wives) had been
overridden. Du Bois had forced the issue by organizing on his own
authority a Massachusetts Niagara Women's Auxiliary, putting Clement
Morgan's wife in charge. Trotter still disapproved of official admission
of women to the movement but would come to Harper's Ferry resigned to
the ratification of Du Bois's proposal, and in a mood remarkably free of
his usual
cantankerousness.[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-58){#cha-58}

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

T[HE SECOND]{.epub-sc} meeting of the Niagara Movement opened on August
15, 1906, at the time of year when the Blue Ridge Mountains are at their
greenest. Calvin Chase's [Bee]{.epub-i} reported trains arriving from
Washington all day Wednesday (over the same railroad tracks that had
brought federal reinforcements to defeat the demonic John Brown),
bringing delegates and visitors ""until the ample dormitories of Storer
College were filled.""[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-59){#cha-59}
Harper's Ferry was an occasion for reconsecration of Talented Tenth
ideals. The delegates and sympathizers came on foot and by horse-drawn
carriage from the station in the seasonably warm town below to the
spacious, shaded campus of Storer College, another AMA institution for
the uplift of ex-slaves, men in high, starched collars and women in hats
that looked like mushrooms or flying saucers. Women were not allowed
into the meetings, an explosive issue that would be resolved at Harper's
Ferry in their favor for the next Niagara conclave. One of them,
handsome Mary Ovington, came as a reporter for the New York [Evening
Post.]{.epub-i} She had admired Du Bois from afar for the better part of
a year before finally meeting him during a roving visit to the South in
spring 1904 (she had not guessed, nor had Du Bois, that her Radcliffe
years coincided with his at Harvard). Since then, she had conferred by
letter with him whenever a thought about the Negro came into her head,
placing her considerable energies and influence at her hero's service.
It was she who had first suggested that he invite her to the meeting.
Trotter brought a piece of John Brown's Springfield, Massachusetts,
house to present to the movement. Byron Gunner of Rhode Island,
Professor Hart and Lafayette Hershaw of the District of Columbia, Dr. O.
M. Waller of New York, Lewis Douglass, Frederick's son who had survived
his Civil War regiment's famous assault on Fort Wagner, and many others
came to rekindle the fires of Fort
Erie.[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-60){#cha-60}

As the people listened to reports on the scourge of Jim Crow, Du Bois
worried about the comprehensive, eloquent statement he was expected to
have ready for the closing session on Sunday. Writing it out in his
left-handed scrawl, he dashed about in vain looking for a typewriter.
Somehow his own portable had failed to follow him from Atlanta. At the
same time, he presided over sessions and conferred in committee and with
individuals about urgent Niagara business. Meanwhile, the speeches
continued: Freeman Murray's call to order; followed by Miss Eva Herrod's
solo and college president Henry T. MacDonald's welcome; and the main
address by J. R. Clifford, secretary of the West Virginia branch of the
Niagara Movement. Thursday night---""Niagara Night""---Trotter and Max
Barber spoke before Miss Mary Clifford recited the stirring ""Credo.""
Early Friday after the women's meeting, the men and women of the Niagara
Movement marched barefoot on dewy grass with candles cupped against the
morning breeze in silent procession down the steep road from their
hilltop residence halls to pay homage to Brown's memory in the old
arsenal. They made the silent march in obedience to Du Bois's flair for
drama. That afternoon they heard his praise of Brown's rage and
rectitude, after which they sang again ""The Battle Hymn of the
Republic""---""but never with such enthusiasm as this afternoon,"" Ovington
wrote in the [Evening Post.]{.epub-i} But it was left to Reverdy Ransom
to electrify the significance of place and moment when they reassembled
on the hilltop in Anthony Hall. ""God sent John Brown to Harper's Ferry,""
the tall, long-maned preacher told them, ""to become a traitor to the
government in order that he might be true to the
slave.""[[61]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-61){#cha-61} Ransom's
address was as lengthy as it was cathartic, going straight to the heart
of the Niagara Movement, his voice booming from the auditorium's
rafters:

Today, two classes of Negroes, confronted by a united opposition, are
standing at the parting of the ways. The one counsels patient submission
to our present humiliations and degradations; it deprecates political
action and preaches the doctrine of industrial development and the
acquisition of property.... The other class believes that it should not
submit to being humiliated, degraded, and remanded to an inferior place.
It believes in money and property, but it does not believe in bartering
its manhood for the sake of
gain.[[62]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-62){#cha-62}

Nothing was to match the applause given to Ransom's oratory until
Hershaw read Du Bois's cadenced and compelling ""Address to the Country""
on the last night of the conference. The men and women at Harper's Ferry
were exalted by Du Bois's five-point resolution demanding quality
education, enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment provision for
reduction in the congressional representation of states where black
people had been eliminated from the ballot, and justice and jobs for
black people and laboring people (""here at last I approached,"" he would
write in the [Autobiography,]{.epub-i} ""the fundamental matter of the
exploitation of the worker, regardless of race and color""). His typist
had finally rendered the handwritten text legible, and, as Hershaw
recited it dramatically, the language lifted the Niagarites. ""We will
not be satisfied to take one jot or tittle less than our manhood
rights,"" Du Bois had written:

We claim for ourselves every single right that belongs to a freeborn
American, political, civil and social; and until we get these rights we
will never cease to protest and to assail the ears of America. The
battle we wage is not for ourselves alone but for all true Americans. It
is a fight for ideals, lest this, our common fatherland, false to its
founding, become in truth the land of the thief and the home of the
Slave---a by-word and a hissing among the nations for its sounding
pretensions and pitiful accomplishments.

""The Address to the Country"" ended with the irrefutably reasonable
demand, ""Cannot the nation that has absorbed ten million foreigners into
its political life without catastrophe absorb ten million Negro
Americans into that same political life at less cost than their unjust
and illegal exclusion will
involve?""[[63]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-63){#cha-63}

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

L[ITTLE MORE]{.epub-sc} than an hour away by train from Harper's Ferry,
Theodore Roosevelt studied an alarming report that would lead to a
fateful decision as Du Bois led his votive procession to John Brown's
fort. The president's popularity at that moment with African-Americans
was enormous. Had he not broken bread in the White House with the Great
Accommodator? Had he not stood fast when the white South fulminated
against Senate confirmation of William Crum as Collector of the Port of
Charleston? He had even shut the post office in Indianola, Mississippi,
after the competent Minnie M. Cox had been terrorized by local whites
into resigning as postmistress. The fact that Roosevelt had badly needed
the support of southern African-American delegates to the 1904 GOP
national convention in order to fend off a nomination challenge
engineered by party boss Mark Hanna accounted for much of his
unconventional behavior. Elected in his own right in 1904, the
brilliant, impetuous president immediately began to distance himself
from his many African-American admirers (of whom Du Bois was never one).
In his Lincoln Day address in February 1905, he appealed for white
racial purity. On swings through the South in April and October,
Roosevelt stressed his mother's southern birth, lectured Tuskegee
undergraduates about the dangers of falling into crime, and derided
African-Americans as a ""backward
race.""[[64]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-64){#cha-64} Yet until
November 1905, he was still the most popular president for
African-Americans since Abraham Lincoln.

In a dust-swept river town on the Texas border with Mexico, ten minutes
of rifle fire would cause the president to make a decision that would
destroy much of his popularity with black people. The Brownsville Raid,
in which black infantry soldiers were alleged to have shot up the town,
killing a white bartender and wounding a police lieutenant, happened
around midnight on Monday, August 13. From the hour the white battalion
commander, Major Charles W. Penrose, had marched his three companies, B,
C, and D, smartly down Elizabeth Street into the fort from the train
station, the behavior of Brownsville's ruling white minority and some
six thousand Mexicans had been hostile. When the raid occurred, the
Niagara delegates and visitors were still a day and a few hours away
from taking trains for Harper's Ferry. All that they knew at the time
from news accounts was that charges had been lodged against virtually
all the men of the First Battalion of the 25th Infantry Regiment
(Colored), recently transferred to sun-baked Fort Brown at the mouth of
the Rio Grande. The 25th Infantry was one of the four congressionally
authorized military units whose men, and occasionally a few of whose
officers, were African-Americans. It was a crack regiment, hardened by
combat with the Great Plains Sioux, jungle rot in Cuba, firefights with
Filipino guerrillas, and four years of garrison duty in
Nebraska.[[65]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-65){#cha-65}

The matter receded to newspaper back pages and then disappeared. The
army investigated. The White House kept its counsel. Congressional
elections approached in November with Republican control of the House
hanging in the balance. African-American votes were significant to the
GOP in Maryland, New York, Missouri, Ohio, New Jersey, and Kansas. A few
days before the elections, Teddy Roosevelt signed an unprecedented order
and, temporarily withholding it from the public, steamed away to Panama
aboard the presidential yacht to see America's new canal. After a
preliminary and inexpert investigation and without benefit of courts
martial, what Roosevelt had done was to order the discharge en masse of
167 of the First Battalion's 170 soldiers without honor and with
forfeiture of pension, among them men with twenty-five years service,
six of them Medal of Honor winners. The world press would shortly carry
the grinning image of a muscular, khaki-clad president at the controls
of a behemoth canal dredge, a fitting posture for a chief executive who
had significantly expanded the writ of the Monroe Doctrine the previous
year. Roosevelt had steamed out of Washington after once again trashing
the courage of black fighting men just as he had done immediately after
the Spanish-American War. Ironically, it had been the men of the 25th
who had reinforced the Rough Riders at a desperate moment in the famous
charge up San Juan
Hill.[[66]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-66){#cha-66}

Roosevelt had informed the Wizard of his intentions at the White House
on October 30, in strictest confidence. Appalled by the ""great blunder,""
Washington had begged Roosevelt to reconsider. Almost simultaneously,
John Milholland of the new, interracial Constitution League telephoned
Mary Terrell from New York on the morning of the third, a Saturday,
telling her she must bustle off to find Secretary of War Taft at home.
The elephantine secretary of war took the extraordinary step of
telegraphing Roosevelt that he was suspending the dismissal order until
his return. But all of them---Washington, Terrell, and Taft---ran up
against the president's rock-solid opposition. ""You cannot have any
information to give me privately, to which I could pay heed, my dear Mr.
Washington,"" Roosevelt had already written his old dinner companion. On
November 7, the day after the elections in which the Republicans
retained control of the House, Roosevelt's discharge of the men of the
25th Infantry's First Battalion was made public. Had the news come
earlier, said Richard Thompson in his syndicated column in the black
press, ""there would have been a disastrous slump in the colored
Republican vote."" Roosevelt's son-in-law, brand-new representative
Nicholas Longworth, acknowledged a debt to African-American voters for
his narrow victory. But if the announcement's timing was cynical, the
administration's proof of the men's guilt was a tissue of circumstance
and conjecture, amounting, said the [World,]{.epub-i} to ""lynch law.""
Even [The New York Times]{.epub-i} gagged: ""Not a particle of evidence
is given in the 112 pages"" proving the guilt of a single enlisted man.
The new Constitution League's investigators returned from Texas with
hard evidence of the regiment's
innocence.[[67]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-67){#cha-67}

For African-Americans, Brownsville was the nadir. From pulpits across
the land imprecations were hurled at the president and the Wizard. ""Once
enshrined in our hearts as Moses,"" cried Reverend Adam Clayton Powell,
Sr., of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, Roosevelt was ""now
enshrouded in our scorn as Judas."" If Roosevelt refused to change his
mind, a member of the Tuskegee Machine wrote Emmett Scott, ""his name
will be anathema with the Negroes from now on,"" leaving unsaid the
obloquy in store for all that Tuskegee stood for. Leonine senator Joseph
Bensen Foraker of Ohio (ally of the recently deceased Hanna) demanded a
full, open investigation, and Taft fretted that the Brownsville incident
might put the ambitious senator into the White House. The Wizard sadly
warned Taft that he had ""never in all my experience with the race
experienced a time when the entire people have the feeling that they now
have in regard to the Administration."" Hurried appointments of Boston's
William Lewis and four or five other African-Americans to largely
honorific federal posts made little difference. ""Neither Mr. Washington
nor the colored peopleÂ ... can risk the hazard to be moved as mere pawns
on this chess board of the President,"" Fortune editorialized in the
[Age,]{.epub-i} virtually ending his close collaboration with the
Tuskegee Machine. The Cleveland [Gazette]{.epub-i} offered a much
blunter warning: ""Politics will yet KILL the great Tuskegee school.
[Mark our
prediction!]{.epub-i}""[[68]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-68){#cha-68}

Summer and fall of 1906 were to be a watershed for African-Americans,
the weeks following the Harper's Ferry conference bringing almost
unrelieved turmoil. In late August 1906, Du Bois was in Lowndes County,
Alabama, fulfilling a research commission for the U.S. Bureau of the
Census, when news of the Atlanta race riot reached him. Before midnight
on September 22, ten thousand white people (most of them under twenty)
had beaten every black person they found on the streets of the city. The
post office, train station, and white-owned businesses had been pillaged
whenever the marauding mob, ferreting out its prey like a huge
bloodhound, sniffed terrified black employees in hiding. At Five Points,
Atlanta's busy intersection where electric trolleys coming from all
parts of the city rumbled through, the mob plucked out dark-skinned
passengers like cotton balls for ginning, finally bringing the transit
system to a dead stop before midnight. ""In some portions of the
streets,"" the [Constitution]{.epub-i} reported, ""the sidewalks ran red
with the blood of dead and dying negroes."" Some African-Americans fought
back before heavy rainfall and the militia finally scattered their
assailants shortly before dawn. John Hope's wife recalled a white mob's
abrupt halt and about-face when it thought better of invading a
notoriously tough black ghetto near the Morehouse campus. The attack by
county police and other rioters on Brownsville in far southeast Atlanta,
a prosperous black community of neat homes and two institutions of
learning, resulted in the deaths of two white county policemen and the
serious wounding of two others. ""Atlanta,"" the august Memphis
[Commercial Appeal]{.epub-i} decreed, ""brought shame to the
South.""[[69]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-69){#cha-69} From
Roosevelt's White House there was only silence.

The immediate cause of the terrible Atlanta riot of 1906 had been the
newspaper drumfire of alleged assaults upon white women by black men.
The underlying cause was to be found in the politics of class conflict
among the white people. As cities of the New South like Atlanta filled
with poor whites and blacks, the planters and politicians in rural
counties mobilized the ""wool hat boys"" to brake the power of the urban
colossi. Bloodsucking railroads, flint-hearted banks, merciless
factories, the loss of white men's jobs to black men, sin, corruption,
and race mixing---the rural diatribe against the cities was shrill and
long. It had almost as much resonance in the cities; in Wilmington,
North Carolina, in November 1898, nimble upper-class white people had
made common cause with frenzied rednecks to purge the city with fire and
blood of Negro rule. It was now the turn of Atlanta, the capital of the
New South, where black men and women were accused of setting terrible
examples for their country cousins by throwing off three hundred years
of servility. Black people were denounced because they threatened to
become a labor reserve against white workers, because they were learning
to bargain their ballots with the sons of the Bourbons for public
schools and sewage systems, while poor white people, with only skin
color in their favor, struggled to keep from becoming proletarianized.
As Du Bois wrote in a moving essay in [The World Today,]{.epub-i} the
explosion had occurred inevitably after ""two years of vituperation and
traduction of the Negro race by the most prominent candidates for
governorship, together with a bad police
system.""[[70]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-70){#cha-70} There was
bitter justice in the fact that the Atlanta Compromise of 1895 would end
in the Atlanta riot of 1906. In the Gresham's law of New South race
relations, the ""good nigger,"" loyal and undemanding, would cease to
exist almost overnight, supplanted by the ""bad nigger,"" criminal and
sexually barbarous.

Hoke Smith, former interior secretary in Grover Cleveland's cabinet, and
Clark Howell, natty [Constitution]{.epub-i} editor and stalwart of the
Wizard's Atlanta Compromise (both upper class, moderate, and well
connected to business), went to great extremes to capture redneck votes
for the Georgia governorship. Smith, a Democrat supported by the Atlanta
[Journal,]{.epub-i} at first posed as something of a Populist,
advocating regulation of railroad rates and avoiding the issue of the
Negro. Howell, Democrat and undisguised friend of order and wealth,
attacked Smith as a bogus friend of the little man who had furthered the
careers of well-connected African-Americans while serving as secretary
of the interior. Unnerved, Smith switched from lambasting railroads to
bashing Negroes as the price for Georgia Populist Tom Watson's crucial
support. Take the black people out of politics, finally, decisively,
Watson demanded of Smith---""nothing can be done as long as the South is
forever frightened into political paralysis by the cry of 'negro
domination.'"" ""What does Civilization owe to the negro? Nothing!
[Nothing!]{.epub-i} NOTHING!"" he shrieked in [Tom Watson's
Magazine.]{.epub-i} Having uncorked the red genie of race and class
conflict, Howell tried in vain to put it back, declaring that the
African-American was already a dead letter in politics, so there was no
need to disfranchise him by law. Smith won the Democratic primary that
August, and pledged to shut the ballot box to Georgia's
African-Americans by constitutional referendum. Exactly one month and
one day later, after tens of thousands of rural white people had
streamed into Atlanta to hear the Democratic candidate for president,
Bryan the Great Commoner, Atlanta
exploded.[[71]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-71){#cha-71} The
Bookerite press would insinuate that Du Bois had gone there to hide out
until calm was restored while a courageous Wizard had hurried from New
York to help his people. Neither report was correct. Washington stayed
put for several more days, issuing deeply pained, even-handed
condemnations of black rapists and white rioters. Du Bois rushed to the
city by train to sit on the steps of South Hall to protect Nina and
Yolande with a shotgun. An exact tally of the dead was never known,
though it must have approached two dozen black people and five or six
white. ""The Atlanta riot was if anything worse than reports,"" Du Bois
wrote Ovington a few days after reaching the city.

""On the way,"" Du Bois related of his rush from rural Alabama, ""I wrote
the 'Litany of \[sic\] Atlanta.'"" One sees him in the segregated
passenger car, perhaps a smelly one filled with women, children, and
farmhands, his temples throbbing as he wrote slowly and with fierce
deliberation line after phosphorescent line. Three weeks later he would
tell Ovington that he knew ""A Litany at Atlanta"" was ""a bit hysterical,""
which it appropriately was---both a bit hysterical and a bit heretical.
Its publication in the October 11 [Independent]{.epub-i} was like a
thunderstorm. ""[Hear us, good Lord!]{.epub-i} Listen to us, Thy
children: our faces dark with doubt are made a mockery in Thy
Sanctuary."" But the God Du Bois apostrophizes is neither innocent nor
omnipotent. ""[Have mercy upon us, miserable sinners!]{.epub-i} And yet,
whose is the deeper guilt?... [Thou knowest, good God!]{.epub-i} Is this
Thy Justice, O Father, that guile be easier than innocence and the
innocent be crucified for the guilt of the untouched guilty?"" With
impassioned hubris Du Bois verged on blasphemy. ""Is not the God of the
Fathers dead? Have not seers seen in Heaven's halls Thine hearsed and
lifeless form stark amidst the black and rolling smoke of sin, where all
along bow bitter forms of endless dead?"" But God was not dead, Du Bois
decided, rather He has left the neighborhood, ""flown afar, up hills of
endless light, through blazing corridors of suns, where worlds do swing
of good and gentle
men.""[[72]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-72){#cha-72}

Then, abruptly, Du Bois turned melodramatically to the phoenix of the
New South: ""A city lay in travail, God our Lord, and from her loins
sprang twin Murder and Black Hate. Red was the midnight; clang, crack,
and cry of death and fury filled the air and trembled underneath the
stars where church spires pointed silently to Thee. And all this was to
sate the greed of greedy men who hide behind the veil of vengeance!"" The
riot, he as much as says, is the spawn of the unholy bargain of 1895.
""Behold this maimed black man, who toiled and sweated to save a bit from
the pittance paid him. They told him: [Work and Rise!]{.epub-i} He
worked. Did this man sin? Nay, but someone told how someone said another
did---one whom he had never seen nor known. Yet for that man's crime
this man lieth maimed and murdered, his wife naked to shame, his
children to poverty and evil. [Hear us, O heavenly Father!]{.epub-i}"" ""A
Litany at Atlanta"" rose to a coruscating pitch of remonstrance, all but
commanding the Deity to make sense of black suffering and to relieve it:
""Bewildered we are passion-tossed, mad with the madness of a mobbed and
mocked and murdered people; straining at the armposts of Thy throne, we
raise our shackled hands and charge Thee, God, by the bones of our
stolen fathers, by the tears of our dead mothers, by the very blood of
Thy crucified Christ: What meaneth this? Tell us the plan; give us the
sign! [Keep not Thou silent, O God!]{.epub-i}"" But as he hurried from
the old abolitionist Calhoun School in Lowndes County to the racial
ceasefire in Atlanta, the last excruciating lines of ""Litany"" implied
that Du Bois had no near-term expectation of divine signs and plans.
""[Hear us, good Lord!]{.epub-i} In night, O God of a godless land! Amen!
In silence, O Silent God.
Selah!""[[73]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-73){#cha-73}

Du Bois's controlled fury would not be present at the awkwardly intense
conference of white and black civil leaders called by Mayor James
Woodward on Sunday. In all probability, he had not yet reached the city.
Alonzo Herndon, Bishop Turner, and Reverend Proctor were among the eight
African-Americans whose aggrieved, dignified bearing shamed the leading
white people present into almost evangelical contrition. Charles T.
Hopkins, standing at the pinnacle of power, called for contributions to
bury the slaughtered and repair property damage, crying out, ""If we let
this dependent race be butchered before our eyes, we cannot face God in
the Judgment Day."" Pledges were exchanged, promises of police reform
made, and within days the citizens group that would eventually become
the Commission on Interracial Cooperation (CIC) was formed. Booker
Washington actually thought the aftermath of the Atlanta riot offered
grounds for renewed optimism about southern race relations. Du Bois
understood that the compact Washington had struck no longer held because
the parties on the other side no longer needed it. The Bourbon South,
the South redeemed by conservative planters and colonels, had become,
with the swiftness of the Mississippi at flood tide, the New South of
urban industries, textile towns, railroads, the crop-lien system,
competing labor, convict lease, and professional Negrophobes. The
tornado of southern populism abating rapidly after 1896 had left the
patriarchal politics of racial collaboration, practiced so skillfully by
South Carolina's Wade Hampton and Mississippi's Lucius Lamar, splintered
and pulped like uprooted trees. Yet it was still [plus Ã§a
change,]{.epub-i} the more things remained the same. The conservative
planters and colonels were not so much submerged in ""new men"" or pushed
aside by Snopeses as reincarnated in the ""radical"" younger generation
that had appropriated the language of the Populists, the racism of the
rednecks, and the economic agenda of Yankee
capitalists.[[74]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-74){#cha-74} This was
partly what Edgar Gardner Murphy had meant when he said he pitied
Washington for not being able to see the racial situation as it truly
was.

What the Wizard could see clearly, though, was the erosion of his power.
At the July 1907 meeting of the Afro-American Council in Baltimore, once
little more than an echo chamber for the Wizard, the members voted to
censure President Roosevelt. In Cleveland, the president's favorite for
mayor went down to defeat partly because of the African-American vote.
While Washington complained to intimates that he had to keep his ""lips
closed,"" Du Bois made excellent use of the opportunity to advance his
leadership influence.[[75]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-75){#cha-75}
He had a new monthly now, [The Horizon: A Journal of the Color
Line,]{.epub-i} debuting in January 1907 and published in Washington
(and later Alexandria, Virginia) on the presses of Du Boisian loyalists
Freeman Murray and his brother F. Morris Murray, with Hershaw as editor.
[The Moon]{.epub-i} had long since run through its final phase,
extinguished in July or August of 1906. The partners had blamed each
other for the weekly's failure, Simon feeling particularly bitter about
Du Bois's attitude. The plant had been mortgaged for five hundred
dollars, Pace had worked without ever drawing a salary, and Simon
snappishly informed Du Bois that something could be salvaged and debts
repaid if only Du Bois would be ""quiet""---""you may get a great deal more
out of this business than you
think.""[[76]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-76){#cha-76}

Better edited and more widely circulated than the Memphis publication,
[The Horizon]{.epub-i} was to have consistently more bite. The magazine
was to be Du Bois's dress rehearsal for a career in propaganda
journalism. Its words were like darts, sharper than [The
Moon]{.epub-i}'s barbs had been, and the targets were larger. Du Bois
noted derisively that the pious Edgar Gardner Murphy, who had lately
taken to calling for repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment as a solution to
worsening race relations, was equally exercised about the increasing
""evil Negro leadership,"" which was guilty of stirring up ""grievances and
fostering hate."" [The Horizon]{.epub-i} attempted to cover the global
world behind the veil, such as developments in Africa and Asia, as well
as peonage in Alabama and lynching generally. The editor drew attention
to persecution of Galician Jews and thundered against imperialism
everywhere---denouncing the diabolic Congo policies of Leopold of the
Belgians and calling the ""Rape of Cuba and the Conquest of the
Philippines"" the blackest deeds in American history since the Seminole
Wars.[[77]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-77){#cha-77} In the second
issue the editor now declared his faith in socialism more firmly than
ever before. Mary Ovington never lost an opportunity to influence him in
that direction, and his own reading of works like Jane Addams's
[Democracy and Social Ethics,]{.epub-i} Jack London's [People of the
Abyss,]{.epub-i} Robert Hunter's [Poverty,]{.epub-i} and John Spargo's
[Socialism,]{.epub-i} as well as Ida Tarbell, Upton Sinclair, Lincoln
Steffens, and other muckrakers had caused him to become more receptive.
He was a ""socialist-of-the-path."" Black peoples' natural allies were not
""the rich but the poor, not the great but the masses, not the employers,
but the employees."" Du Bois spoke obvious truths that were,
nevertheless, far from obvious to most African-Americans (and not even
to himself a few years previously), who still felt an almost religious
loyalty to the Republican party. He didn't believe in the total
abolition of private property, but he was certain that America was
""approaching a time when railroads, coal mines, and many factories can
and ought be run by the public for the public."" In socialism lay ""the
one great hope of the Negro
American.""[[78]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-78){#cha-78}

But socialism would have had little more than casual appeal for most of
his readers. It was in ""The Lash,"" a May 1907 editorial in which Du Bois
presented a devastating psychological profile of the Wizard's minister
of information for the North---Thomas Fortune---that Talented Tenth
readers found potent ammunition. Fortune, once a great talent of moral
force, had succumbed to the Wizard's lash of money and power. Du Bois
recalled the avuncular encouragement Fortune had given to his own
beginner's efforts as a journalist. ""No matter how far the writer has
fallen and grovelled in the dust,"" Du Bois wrote that he would forever
be grateful. The great newspaperman had become increasingly ""bitter,
wild and strained."" ""Drink, women, and debt"" assailed him. Then came the
""Arch-Tempter""---Booker T. Washington---whispering that he had ""a
commission from the Gods-that-be to buy your soul."" And so, Fortune was
lost to the cause of civil rights. But Du Bois entreated readers to
examine their own consciences to decide where the ultimate fault lay.
""Who refused to hold up his hands? Who refused his wiser youthful
leadership? Who withheld the money and bread and clothes due him and his
suffering family? We did."" Du Bois displayed no such tenderness for
Teddy Roosevelt. Brownsville was a burning issue, and the editor served
up hot coals. ""If the truth must be told,"" Du Bois told readers,
""Theodore Roosevelt does not like black folk. He has no faith in them. I
do not think he really ever knew a colored man intimately as a friend.""
Stoking the coals, he asked rhetorically, ""What after all have we to
thank Roosevelt for?"" Three things---""for asking a man to dine with him,
for supporting another man, quite worthy of the position, as Collector
of the Port of Charleston, and for saying, publicly, that the door of
opportunity ought to be held open to colored men?"" But Du Bois then
noted acidly, ""The door once declared open, Mr. Roosevelt by his word
and deed since has slammed most emphatically in the black mans
face.""[[79]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-79){#cha-79}

Du Bois's platform presence was improving, and he sensed that his
message was beginning to draw sympathizers from around the edges of the
powerful Tuskegee Machine. He reproached himself for not being able to
""slap people on the shoulder, and I forgot their names."" But he was
determined somehow ""to get these people together""---these Niagarites.
Rallying most of them in a large audience of some eight hundred (the
largest number ever) in Boston for the third annual meeting at the end
of August 1907, he read once again another ""Address to the Country.""
Flaying Roosevelt for ""swaggering roughshod over the helpless black
regiment whose bravery made him famous,"" he stirred the audience in
Faneuil Hall. ""We are not discouraged,"" he declared in that dry voice
often more moving to his listeners than the standard, full-throated
oratory typical of such occasions. ""Help us brothers, for the victory
which lingers, must and shall prevail."" The Bookerite Indianapolis
[Freeman]{.epub-i} dismissed the Boston meeting as a ""final shriek of
despair,"" but it was a shriek that many had heard. The Niagara
Movement's treasury had less than four hundred dollars in it, and many
members were under mounting pressure from the Tuskegee Machine, but
there were now thirty-four state chapters (although only one in the Deep
South---Atlanta), more than ten thousand pamphlets, tracts, and the
mobilization of African-American opinion to help defeat a
passenger-segregation amendment to a federal railroad-rates
bill.[[80]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-80){#cha-80}

Modest success brought problems, though. Du Bois had decided to hold the
third Niagara meeting in Boston only after forcing Trotter and Morgan to
a truce in a dispute of such bitterness that movement unity had been
taxed. There was ample wrong on both sides---Trotter was hypersensitive,
Morgan was vain; Trotter opposed the state governor's reelection; Morgan
supported it and high-handedly eliminated the Trotters from planning
meetings for a Niagara money-raising social in Cambridge. Governor
Curtis Guild was anathema to Trotter because of his approval of state
funds for the segregated tercentenary exposition at Jamestown, Virginia.
Far worse, Morgan had campaigned for Guild's successful reelection in
return for GOP backing for a seat in the legislature. During several
days' sojourn with the Trotters in mid-June, Du Bois was driven almost
to distraction as he mediated between the Trotters and the Morgans. No
sooner had new terms been agreed to by one side than the other side
rejected them. Deenie Trotter huffily announced she was quitting the
movement after Du Bois refused to cave in to her husband's
twenty-two-page ultimatum. Trotter objected to his former colleague
George Forbes's soldierly help and Morgan's large planning role in the
third Niagara meeting. A ""very difficult man to get along with whenever
he differs from your opinion,"" Du Bois wrote Mary Ovington resignedly.
His own leadership role was pretty exasperating, Du Bois added, ""because
it does not really belong to meÂ ... nevertheless I am going to try and
do my duty.""[[81]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-81){#cha-81} Finally,
thoroughly disgusted, Du Bois banged together an uneasy truce and then
sailed for Europe. The Trotter rift, however, never mended, and the
successful Boston meeting that August was really the beginning of the
end of Niagara.

By July 1908, Du Bois was calling in [The Horizon]{.epub-i} and
elsewhere for a black exodus from the Republican party. For the great
majority of the race, he knew that to urge desertion from the party of
Lincoln was an almost incomprehensible heresy. On the other hand, now
that Roosevelt had made a circuit through the South pandering to white
supremacy and Taft had come out unabashedly for lily-white
Republicanism, he thought it just barely possible that a significant
number of his people might vote Democratic to show their contempt for
the GOP's contempt of them. ""It is high noon, brethren,"" he challenged
in Trotter's [Guardian]{.epub-i}---""the clock has struck twelve. What
are we going to do? I have made up my mind. You can do as you
please---you are free, sane and twenty-one. If between the two parties
who stand on identically the same platform you can prefer the party who
perpetuated Brownsville, well and good! But I shall vote for
Bryan.""[[82]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-82){#cha-82} As he rallied
to the lesser of two political evils, he saw the credibility of the
Tuskegee Machine being put to the test as never before. Economic
progress in exchange for political impotence was the touchstone of
Booker Washington's creed, a vision of better times coming slow but sure
as toil and savings earned relief from misery and respect from white
folk. Beyond the fine buildings and manicured grounds of the Tuskegee
campus, however, signs of black progress and white benignity had become
rare ten years after the Atlanta Compromise. The price of cotton had
been falling once again since 1903 from an already abysmal low, and with
it constraints on white violence in the South. A plague of
""whitecappings"" (mob violence) infested southwestern Mississippi as poor
white people lashed out against all signs of black success and tried to
drive out black storekeepers, businessmen, and landowning farmers.

Few race leaders had embraced the Gospel of Tuskegee more fervently than
Isaiah Montgomery, lone African-American delegate to the disfranchising
1890 Mississippi constitutional convention and founder of all-black
Mound Bayou township. But in the fall of 1904, even the simple faith of
Montgomery seemed to waver as he wrote desperately to the Wizard of
terrible goings-on. At West Point, Reverend C. A. Buchanan, owner of
""the best appointed printing establishment of any colored man in the
state,"" and his genteel daughter were ordered by white people to sell
his business and leave town. Thomas Henry, who ran a ""neat little
grocery and kept a buggy,"" was told to sell it and walk. Mr. Meacham,
owner of a pool hall, was ordered to liquidate and report for manual
labor in overalls. Montgomery's long, bleak letter evoked from the
normally imperturbable Wizard the admission that such ""conditions
certainly do seem all but unbearable."" So unbearable, indeed, that
Governor Vardaman---white supremacy incarnate---had finally moved to
suppress the lawlessness through the use of Pinkerton informers when it
flared up again in
1906.[[83]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-83){#cha-83}

The Atlanta riot spoke grim volumes about the extent to which the
Bookerite bargain had become a fatal trap. Brownsville tore the veil of
trust to shreds. At Jane Addams's Hull House in Chicago in 1907, Du Bois
had played seer with uncanny perfection, warning that the ""Door of
Opportunity"" was swinging shut and that times were coming ""even here in
the Twentieth Century when if an Abraham Lincoln should arise in the
United States and if he should be a Jew in race or a Japanese in color,
or a Negro in descentÂ ... his soul would be pressed and shut out of the
republic of the civilized."" When the fourth, and second to last, annual
Niagara Movement meeting convened in Oberlin, Ohio, in August 1908, Du
Bois brought tidings of doom. ""Once we were told: Be worthy and fit and
the ways are open,"" delegates heard him declare. ""Today the avenues of
advancement in the army, navy and civil service, and even in business
and professional life, are continually closed to black applicants of
proven fitness, simply on the bald excuse of race and
color.""[[84]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter12-84){#cha-84} Du Bois and
the Niagarites had tried to do their best to present an alternative to
the Tuskegee Machine and to become an effective force against racial
discrimination, but in terms of actual accomplishment they had largely
preached to the converted. The real task lay perilously ahead.

S[OCIAL]{.epub-sc} S[CIENCE]{.epub-sc}, A[MBITION, AND]{.epub-sc}
T[USKEGEE]{.epub-sc}

T[HE DU BOISES]{.epub-sc} celebrated Christmas of 1897 in their faculty
apartment on the Atlanta University campus. Du Bois had decided that he,
Nina, and the baby would take rooms in South Hall, the men's dormitory,
rather than attempt to rent a house on the other side of town in the
Auburn Avenue residential area where most black professional families
lived. The treasurer and faculty dean, Myron Adams, a white New
Englander, also lived in South Hall with his wife. The Adams baby,
Margaret, had either just arrived, or soon would, to join Burghardt in
raising the decibel level on the third floor. Another white New
Englander, Miss Lizzie Pingree, the dormitory matron, lived across the
hall from the Du Boises. Nina took to her immediately, initiating a
friendship that would live on through letters and occasional visits long
after she and Will had left Atlanta University and when Pingree was in
retirement.

Bazolene Usher, an attractive and brilliant student who graduated second
in the class of 1906, was one of the very few persons still alive in
1987 who remembered Nina Du Bois. As a first-year scholarship student
from a small south-Georgia town, Usher devoted several hours each
Saturday to odd domestic tasks in the Du Bois household. Lizzie Pingree
regularly came to the apartment when Will was away, and Usher observed
that the usually reticent Nina appeared to relax and become cheerful and
quite talkative. As Usher put it more than three quarters of a century
later, Nina, who ""was just quiet and calm and had very little really to
say,"" opened up with Pingree (""a fluffy kinda somebody"") and their
animated gossip sometimes distracted the serious student helper from the
studies she found time to do there in 1902. ""She didn't seem to me to
have beyond a high school education,"" Usher mistakenly believed of Nina.
""She was a beautiful womanÂ ... but very quiet and very few people knew
her.""[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-1){#cha-1}

In the winter of 1897--98, Nina was more alive than she would ever be
again, except, possibly, for several charmed weeks in Paris in the late
twenties. Cloistered parenting was scarcely possible with a baby like
Burghardt, an intensely inquisitive boy, large for his age and
determined to walk early. Will had to leave Burghardt's management to
Nina much more than he wanted to, since the demands of class lectures,
conferences, magazine deadlines, the final [Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i}
chapters, and the ambitious new Atlanta University Studies left him only
minutes each day to spend with the baby. Whether it was mainly because
of such demands or by voluntary and mutual accord, Will increasingly
ceded the domain of household finances to Nina as well. There were far
fewer transactions like that of Christmas 1896 in Philadelphia: Herr Du
Bois ""sat down and figured carefullyÂ ... finally evolv\[ing\] a surplus
of \$10.56, and t\[elling\] wife that \[they\] could spend five dollars
apiece for the holidays.""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-2){#cha-2}
Although she would never work outside the home, and so remained
dependent on her husband's income, Nina's letters reveal that early on
she became the better business brain of the family.

She probably did feel out of her depth intellectually in the small,
earnest, and isolated university community of mostly third-generation
abolitionists. Even so, she seems to have played the role of faculty
wife commendably. Bessie Taylor (Page) was enchanted by Nina's
unaffected grace at the first student reception soon after the couple's
arrival---""such a dainty bride who made warm friends among us,"" she
recalled. Whenever Nina appeared with a toddling Burghardt, a few
students invariably joined them. He was ""our baby,"" Taylor sighed, ""how
pretty we thought him.""[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-3){#cha-3}
Life was good for Nina. She looked after Burghardt and Will and
furnished the South Hall apartment. Her first two years in Atlanta were
rewardingly busy. There was one fact of life about which Nina absolutely
refused to soft-pedal to anybody. She took an early and inveterate
dislike to the Deep South with its raw racism, its nonexistent
recreational facilities, and the lack of a single hospital or public
high school to serve Atlanta's large African-American population.
Nothing in provincial Iowa or backward Wilberforce had prepared her for
the stinging apartheid in the capital of the so-called New South.
Indeed, in the North, Nina's hair and color had generally shielded her
from the hawk-eyed racial discernment exercised throughout the South.

For Du Bois, the twelve Atlanta years were the best and worst of times.
Serving up game prose in [Darkwater]{.epub-i} and the
[Autobiography,]{.epub-i} he wrote of a time of ""great spiritual
upturning, of the making and unmaking of ideals, of hard work and hard
play."" He says that it was there that he ""lost most of \[his\]
mannerisms"" and ""grew more broadly human, made \[his\] closest and most
holy friendships.""[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-4){#cha-4} If Nina
resented the South's racial climate viscerally, he suffered it
philosophically in the belief that a few years of ground-breaking
scholarship on his part would draw the generous attention of mainstream
academe and philanthropy. When that happened, he would be able either to
garner unprecedented resources at Atlanta or, better still, to move on
to some independent and well-funded enterprise under his own direction
in order to pursue the kind of research he had recently outlined before
the American Academy of Political and Social Science. No miracles would
be needed to make white scholars and benefactors appreciate his work, Du
Bois believed. ""The ultimate evil was stupidity,"" for which he had the
ready cure in ""knowledge based on scientific investigation,"" ""carefully
gathered scientific proof that neither color nor race determined the
limits of a man's capacity or desert."" To that end, then, he determined
to isolate himself ""in the ivory tower of
race.""[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-5){#cha-5}

An ""ivory tower of race"" was an apt description of Atlanta University,
suggesting an isolation that was physical as well as intellectual.
""AU's"" three redbrick buildings stood angular and handsome on the
highest of the hills cradling the ungainly new railroad city risen out
of the ashes left in Sherman's wake. The school was connected to
downtown Atlanta, two miles away, by a red-clay artery that sliced the
base of the hill dead center and extended beyond the city limits to the
undistinguished Chattahoochee River. The campus halves had been
reconnected by a high and narrow iron bridge across which visits to the
women in North Hall by men from South Hall were more carefully monitored
than compulsory chapel attendance. The poet-songwriter and civil rights
statesman fames Weldon Johnson, class of '94, called Atlanta University
""a spot fresh and beautiful, a rest for the eyes from what surrounded
it, a green island in a dull, red sea."" Like Fisk, Atlanta University
had been established immediately after the Civil War by
Congregationalist missionaries from the North. Its Yale-trained teachers
made only the most unavoidable concessions to place, culture, and
resources in order to conduct the school like an excellent New England
liberal arts college. Matthew Arnold's precepts guided their
pedagogy---the teaching of that ""disinterested endeavor to learn and
propagate the best that is known and thought in the world""---in Georgia.

The children of white fathers, or of parents whose fathers or
grandfathers were white, came to the university from all over the South.
Complexions in early morning chapel ranged from Anglo-Saxon alabaster to
African bronze. So many of AU's students straddled the South's vigilant
categories of black and white that a curious term, ""no-nation,"" came
into common use among them and many of the townspeople---denoting people
who in time would face the wrenching choice of either falling back into
Afro-America or exiting from it into troubled whiteness. When Du Bois
took up his professorship, the school had been subjected for several
years to an almost total boycott by white Atlanta, its faculty treated
as pariahs and its students periodically intimidated. Whenever they
stepped off the campus into West Mitchell Street, alumnus Johnson
recalled, ""they underwent as great a transition as would have resulted
from being instantaneously shot from a Boston drawing room into the
wilds of Borneo.""[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-6){#cha-6} Through
it all, President Horace Bumstead held fast to the classical curriculum
imported from the North by Asa Ware of Yale, the founding president and
his immediate predecessor, whose granite cenotaph stood like a small
Gibraltar at the center of the campus. Yet he also improved upon what
otherwise would have been a deadening compromise by adapting the
vocational curriculum typical of Hampton and Tuskegee to the AU ethos.
Ware had made the motto of Yale's class of 1863, ""I Will Find a Way or
Make One,"" the motto of Atlanta University, and Bumstead tried to put it
into practice. At Atlanta, industrial training was reinforced by
education in the liberal arts rather than undermined by them. So much so
that, as Du Bois would write later, ""even industrial training in the
South was often in the hands of Atlanta graduates. Tuskegee had always
been largely manned by graduates of Atlanta and some of the best school
systems of the South were directed by persons trained at Atlanta
University,"" and, he might have added, by
himself.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-7){#cha-7}

The unfolding reality, however, was that Du Bois's new affiliation was
fatally out of step with the New South of insurgent rednecks and an
increasing embarrassment to the children of northern abolitionists
waxing rich and hypocritical from railroad debentures and textile
holdings. The irony of this sixty-five-acre campus on the site of the
Confederate ramparts that had slowed the Union Army's march---its white
faculty taking common meals with the students (a few of whom were also
white)---had finally proven too much for the Georgia legislature. Over
the protests of Atticus Haygood, Atlanta's Methodist bishop, Slater Fund
general agent, and AU trustee, the university had been deprived of its
thirteen-year-old annual land-grant appropriation of eight thousand
dollars in 1887, essentially for refusing to abandon race mixing in the
dining hall. Five years later, the American Missionary Association
withdrew its subsidy, consistent with a policy, it said, of encouraging
the southern institutions that it had created to begin standing on their
own feet. The creed of the nineties held that it was a dangerous conceit
to expose black people to literature, history, philosophy, and ""dead""
languages, thereby ""spoiling"" them for the natural order of southern
society in which their place was as voteless, industrious farmhands,
primary schoolteachers, and occasional merchants. Demagogic Governor
James K. Vardaman of Mississippi, ""the White Chief,"" gave voice to the
extreme southern version of that creed, bawling that the Negro was a
""lazy, lying, lustful animal which no conceivable amount of training can
transform into a tolerable
citizen.""[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-8){#cha-8}

While the white South prepared to gut higher education for
African-Americans, Du Bois kept to Johnson's ""green island in a dull,
red sea."" His contact with the surrounding white city ""was limited to
some necessary shopping.... \[He\] did not enter parks or museums,
\[but\] assumed that when the public was invited to any place or
function, either the white people were meant, or, if not, attendance of
Negroes meant segregated parts or
times.""[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-9){#cha-9} There was more
than enough teaching and writing to engage him on the hill. In addition
to two advanced courses in ""economics and history"" and sociology, he
taught a class in American citizenship and another in civil government
in the high school run by the university. Enrollments were heavy in the
high school classes, but he had a manageable fourteen students in
economics and history, and twelve in his new sociology elective.
Although he thought he was becoming ""more broadly human,"" Professor Du
Bois probably would have failed a student popularity contest during his
first two or three years at Atlanta, especially among the youngest
pupils. Bessie Taylor thought Professor Du Bois was a ""silent unsociable
kind of man"" at first---and, later, she told him so. Jauntily wielding
his walking stick about campus, he was oblivious to the fact that many
of the high school students and even a few of the older ones backed away
or reflexively flinched when he approached. ""Some children came from the
country,"" Bazolene Usher explained, ""and were used to the white folks
using canes"" on them, a distressing observation corroborated by Clarence
Bacote, Atlanta University's historian. Moreover, Du Bois quickly
acquired a reputation for espying and reporting malefactors, especially
those who violated the university's strict nonsmoking
code.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-10){#cha-10}

But it was his manner that astonished students most; he was a showman
clearly aiming for effect. The impression upon Kathleen Adams,
advantaged daughter of a local African-American businessman and one of
Du Bois's first sociology students, was still vivid in her mind in 1987.
""He was a man of distinction; the way he walked, settled his shoulders,
and his voice,"" she sighed. ""You had to pay attention to him. When he
entered the chapel, you looked at him, and you followed him until he got
to his seat and sat down."" Du Bois had stunned a chapel assembly during
his first appearance by giving President Bumstead a terse ""no"" when
asked to lead the morning prayer. For as long as the AU oral tradition
endures, there will be amused accounts of Du Bois declining to lead
chapel assemblies in their devotions, just as he had once done at
Wilberforce. Those recollections must be qualified, however, by the
intriguing fact that the heretic in their midst eventually offered
occasional prayers of brevity and beauty in chapel, and at least once at
commencement. ""Give us grace, O God, to dare to do the deed which we
know well cries out be done"" was one such ecumenical
appeal.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-11){#cha-11} The figure he
cut on the tennis court behind South Hall won high marks from female
students, some of whom had begun calling him ""Dube"" behind his back. It
was Bessie Taylor who told him twenty years afterward that she and her
ogling classmates had suddenly realized that ""you were young---you
played tennis and in such a way thatÂ ... \[we\] saw nothing of that
formal dignity we knew
indoors.""[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-12){#cha-12} Will was
lightly muscled, with fine buttocks and well-shaped calves that filled
tennis whites appealingly.

The demeanor impressed, but, for many, there were allergic reactions to
the upper-level courses. Adams says ""it was just as quiet as a pin in
his \[class\] room."" Lectures in steepled old Stone Hall began precisely
on the second, pocket watch on the lectern, and latecomers were barred
without benefit of appeal. Classes ended just as punctually. Generally,
Du Bois lectured the full period, but after gauging the level of
alertness or sophistication, he sometimes fed the class questions to
encourage participation. This was a high-risk technique, though, that
could leave a student badly shaken by the professor's polite but mordant
dismissal of an uninformed or unintelligent
response.[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-13){#cha-13} Du Bois's
appreciation of himself was a good deal less austere than his students'.
He tried to be ""natural and honest and frank, but it was bitter hard,""
he found, because most of the minds he was paid to mold were unready to
understand how completely their destinies were in the hands of southern
white people. ""What would you say to a soft, brown face, aureoled in a
thousand ripples of gray-black hair"" blurting out in American history,
""'Do you trust white people?'"" he asked himself on one occasion. ""You do
not and you know that you do not much as you want to."" For the student's
sake, nevertheless, and in service to some Ideal Truth above the truth
of experience, Du Bois told her she ""must trust them, that most white
folks are honest, and all the while you are lying on every level, silent
eye there knows you are lyingÂ ... to the greater glory of
God.""[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-14){#cha-14}

As a rule, the brighter the student, the greater his or her admiration
of Du Bois. Believing that the professor was an Episcopalian, Bazolene
Usher's brother not only joined that church but became one of its first
African-American priests in the South. Kathleen Adams and her best
friend Alice Bell, another privileged Atlantan, sat spellbound in the
high school history course as Du Bois ""describe\[d\] places that were
connected with what he was teaching."" Brilliant Harry H. Pace from south
Georgia, matinee-idol handsome and a venturesome future businessman,
would be a Du Bois loyalist for the rest of his life. Round, brown
Augustus Granville Dill, a peppery student from Ohio, who would earn a
master's degree in sociology, worshipped him. Even though her best
friend, Lizzie Coleman, failed Civic Government, Bessie Taylor
remembered going daily ""with such pride into this sacred class."" She
still considered that it had been a privilege to study with the
demanding, brilliant young professor, as did Edward B. Thompson, who
recalled Du Bois's ""skill of trying to make you thinkÂ ... and he pulled
on your intellectual powers with broad reading and open discussion."" By
the second semester of the second year, the college literary magazine,
[The Scroll,]{.epub-i} reported the following student research papers in
economics and history and sociology: ""Poverty""; ""Rise of and Development
of the Wages System in the South""; ""The Credit System""; ""Wages and
Negroes""; ""The Negro as Consumer""; ""The Legal Position of the Negro"";
""The Negro Merchant in Atlanta""; ""The Well-to-Do in Atlanta""; and ""The
Negro Labor in
Atlanta.""[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-15){#cha-15}

These research papers were building blocks in the third Atlanta
Conference of Negro Problems, the famous series of studies produced by
Atlanta University, which were under Du Bois's direction after 1897. Du
Bois put his talent into teaching, but his genius went into the studies.
""Mortality Among Negroes in Cities"" and ""Social and Physical Condition
of Negroes in Cities,"" the first and second in the Atlanta conference
series, had appeared in 1896 and 1897, respectively, and reflected the
biases of George Bradford, the white Boston businessman and university
trustee---a Harvard graduate ""who for several years has been making the
study of the Negro the occupation of his leisure time."" With Bumstead's
help, Bradford recruited the secretarial and research skills of three of
the university's most outstanding recent graduates and coming race
notables, James W. Johnson, Boston lawyer Butler Wilson, and literature
professor George A. Towns. Questionnaires about general living
conditions in nine cities were funneled to key Atlanta graduates Lucy
Laney in Augusta, Dr. W. B. Matthews in Atlanta, and Lafayette M.
Hershaw and Dr. W. Bruce Evans in Washington, professional men and women
who would later rally to Du Bois's side in his struggles with Booker T.
Washington.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-16){#cha-16}

The idea for a series of annual research publications originated with
the conferences on education, labor, and farming hosted each year since
the early 1890s by Hampton and Tuskegee. Bradford's special contribution
(influenced by Harvard sociologist Edward Cummings) was to recommend
that the Atlanta University Studies adopt an urban agenda. Twelve
percent of the country's seven million African-Americans (once
overwhelmingly rural) had moved to the cities by 1890 (as compared with
16 percent of white people). At Tuskegee and Hampton, the one- and
two-day conferences focused on the needs of the rural schoolhouse, the
one-mule farmer, and the village blacksmith, paying little or no
attention to the long-term significance of the demographics explored at
the first Atlanta University conferences and in their publications.
Bradford's stewardship rendered an important service to problems of the
future, while Hampton and Tuskegee concentrated on inherited conditions
that were already undergoing fundamental transformation. When he learned
from Cummings of Du Bois's work on the Philadelphia project, Bradford
knew he had found an ideal scholar to whom the baton of research could
be passed. But if he expected Du Bois to endorse the interpretations
thus far placed upon high mortality, disabling disease, stubborn
illiteracy, crime, vagrancy, and unemployment among black urban
dwellers, Bradford and his colleagues were in for a reeducation.

President Bumstead's inaugural introduction to the studies had set a
tone of specious sociological neutrality and laissez-faire public
policy. He wrote of his certainty that the ""study of human life,"" which
for purposes of ""convenience"" happened to center on the Negro, would
have ""practically the same result"" if repeated ""with any other race."" As
spelled out by the interracial Atlanta, Fisk, Berea, Lincoln, Spelman,
and Howard University contributors to ""Social and Physical Condition of
Negroes in Cities,"" Bumstead's logic left the urban African-American to
improve his lot through better morals and harder work. White Professor
Eugene Harris of Fisk recognized that white people had an impact on the
life chances of black people, but ""in a very indirect and unimportant
way."" ""Separate apartments in public conveniences, such as hotels,
theatres, or railroad trains, social ostracism, exclusion from political
preferment and the spoils of office, the suppression of his ballot, and
the other discriminations which are made against the black man, have at
least no immediate bearing on his health, vitality, or longevity,""
Harris wrote seriously. Without recorded dissent, the second Atlanta
conference concluded that ""the excessive mortality \[of black people\]
cannot be attributed in any large degree to the unfavorable conditions
of environment, but must be chiefly attributed to the ignorance of the
masses of the people and their disregard of the laws of health and
morality.""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-17){#cha-17}

If the first and second Atlanta University Studies seemed to bear out
Hampton founder Armstrong's pronouncement that ""the Kingdom of Heaven
will come through sociology studied and applied wisely in a levelheaded
way,"" it was soon obvious that Du Bois was not the messiah the general
had in mind. ""Without thought or consultation,"" the new professor wrote
that he ""rather peremptorily changed the plans of the first two Atlanta
Conferences."" As he polished the last pages of [The Philadelphia
Negro,]{.epub-i} Du Bois dreamed of a laboratory in which the ""concrete
group of living beings artificially set off by themselves"" would be
studied broadly, intensely, incrementally, until, year by year ""the
vague mass of so-called Negro problems"" lost its alien mystery and was
reduced to the ""laws of social living clearer, surer, and more
definite.""[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-18){#cha-18} He
anticipated annual gatherings in late May in Atlanta featuring many of
the best minds in the world. In the manner of University of Berlin
students devouring their seminar bibliographies, the resultant Atlanta
University Studies, generously funded by philanthropy, would
systematically master all the possible topics in the field of race. It
remained to be seen if, as he said, the major obstacle to this work was
only ""stupidity.""

With only a small sum made available by Bradford, Du Bois fired off
invitations to and requests for papers for the third Atlanta conference
from his old Fisk classmate, Hugh Proctor, now pastor of Atlanta's
exclusive First Congregational Church; Mrs. Helen Cook, president of the
tony Women's League of Washington, D.C.; Lafayette M. Hershaw, destined
to become one of Du Bois's most valuable collaborators; Miss Minnie
Perry of the board of Atlanta's black orphanage; Alexander Crummell,
living out his last months in Red Bank, New Jersey; and several others.
Once again, however, Du Bois's memory improved somewhat on the facts
pertaining to the editing of the third Atlanta report of 1898. Because
he had arrived only four months earlier or, perhaps, because he decided
to make a temporary, tactical concession to his predecessors' work,
""Some Efforts of American Negroes for Their Own Social Betterment"" was a
rather conventional, disjointed piece---a statistical smorgasbord of
cooperative enterprises, traditional businesses, insurance
establishments, and property holdings by individuals and churches,
combined with some routine observations about infant and adult death
rates in southern cities. It was distinguished primarily by Crummell's
essay burlesquing Booker Washington's
salvation-through-industrial-education message and the editor's
finger-wagging at the churches for not doing more to help
consumers.[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-19){#cha-19}

By the following year, though, with the publication of the provocative
""The Negro in Business,"" Du Bois's distinctive thinking began to shape
the reports. The two-day conference on May 30 and 31, 1899, in Ware
Memorial Chapel, was addressed by none other than Allen D. Candler,
patriarch of the Coca-Cola clan and Bourbon governor of the state, who
professed to know that there were as many ""God-serving and God-loving""
black Georgians as there were white. Getting down to business, Du Bois
reminded the conferees that most ""God-serving"" African-Americans were
""still serfs, bound to the soil or house servants,"" adding acidly, ""the
nation which robbed them of the fruits of their labor for two and a half
centuries, finally set them adrift penniless."" For all the boasting by
some about the race's remarkable economic advancement since slavery,
""The Negro in Business"" was the first careful documentation of such
claims. Putting the total number of African-American businessmen in the
United States at five thousand, Du Bois broke them down by
occupation---grocers, barbers, printers, hackmen, realtors, plumbers,
and so on---and then put a magnifying glass to their activities in key
cities. What emerged was a blueprint of the segregated black world's
economic
infrastructure.[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-20){#cha-20}

A handsome young professor at nearby Atlanta Baptist College for Men
(the future Morehouse), John Hope, read three papers, one of which, ""The
Meaning of Business,"" presented a keen analysis of the ""competition
between the races in new fields"" and the impending displacement of
unskilled black labor caused by industrial development in the South.
Hope sounded again the central theme of the conference---that the
African-American community had to accumulate capital as rapidly as
possible by creating its own markets. The resolutions of this fourth
Atlanta University conference called for an upsurge in business activity
and disciplined patronage of race ""enterprisesÂ ... even at some slight
disadvantage""; resolution six in particular proposed ""Negro Business
Men's LeaguesÂ ... in every town and hamlet,"" and a gradual federation
""from these of state and national organizations."" The empire-building
Booker Washington paid Du Bois the compliment of appropriating the Negro
Business League idea the following
year.[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-21){#cha-21} The Atlanta
professor's economic thinking in 1899 was no more radical than the
Tuskegee principal's. Philosophically indistinguishable from the
conventional American laissez-faire orthodoxy of personal and collective
bootstrap improvement, ""The Negro in Business"" made its contribution in
the area of data and organizational policy.

The reports of 1900 and 1901 on college and public school education seem
impressive today mainly as time-bound feats, antiquarian atlases now of
interest only to a small number of scholars. When he repeated ""The
College-Bred Negro"" and ""The Negro Common School"" ten years later, in
1910 and 1911, respectively, Du Bois would greatly expand the
information contained in them, although maintaining the same methodology
and format: questionnaires sent to hundreds of college and common school
students, letters from professors, teachers, and officials (private and
public), curriculum requirements (texts used) and grade school
attendance reports, per capita expenditures by state, tabulations of
results. But once again, Du Bois was the first to compile and analyze
what should have already been available to professionals and a concerned
public. The college-bred Negro was to most white Americans a phenomenon
even more curious than the revelation in [The Philadelphia
Negro]{.epub-i} of the existence of a Negro class structure. An
illustration of this fact would come in February 1901 as Du Bois
testified in Washington before the U.S. Industrial Commission. ""Colored
men?"" an incredulous Commissioner Albert Clarke would interject when Du
Bois mentioned African-American holders of bachelor's
degrees.[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-22){#cha-22} The fifth
Atlanta study (1900) digested responses ranging from purest Horatio
Alger to bitterest fatalism from almost half the 2,600 living men and
women graduates of postsecondary institutions. College education had
been a success and would continue to be necessary for African-Americans,
Du Bois concluded---just as necessary as industrial training. The lode
of carefully tabulated facts, tracking for the first time three decades
of gaping educational disparities between white and black children in
the South, graphically justified the conclusion to ""The Negro Common
School"": [""Race antagonism can only be stopped by intelligence. It is
dangerous to wait, it is foolish to hesitate. Let the nation immediately
give generous aid to Southern common school
education.""]{.epub-i}[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-23){#cha-23}

Du Bois's 1902 ""Negro Artisan"" study was one of his best in terms of
methodology. From responses to comprehensive questionnaires sent to
1,300 skilled laborers in the South, he developed a wide-angle
socioeconomic photograph of labor and race relations at the turn of the
century. There were comparative data gathered by collaborating
African-American college graduates from thirty-two states, Canada, and
Costa Rica, as well as analogous material from a large survey of black
labor conducted earlier by the Chattanooga [Times,]{.epub-i} a white
newspaper. Wages, working conditions, skill levels, the extent of
displacement by white people and the superannuation of certain crafts,
and workplace race relations were tabulated and examined with the
interspersed testimonials of the artisans themselves. Figures from
organized labor revealed wholesale exclusion of African-Americans. Among
1.2 million union members nationally, Du Bois counted less than 40,000
nonwhites. Most were found among the organized workers in the Alabama,
West Virginia, and Virginia coal mines, the New Orleans dock workers,
and in the Louisiana timber
camps.[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-24){#cha-24}

In both ""The Negro Church"" the following year and ""The Negro American
Family"" five years later, impressive methodology was upstaged by
historical sociology. Never before had the religious and family cultures
and institutions of the African in America been linked to the preslavery
past. The black African subsoil that had nurtured Egyptian religions,
the spread of Obeah ""sorcery"" in West Africa after the collapse of
strong kingdoms there, the power of the chieftaincy and the clan over
the individual, the authority held by women in matrilineal family
structures---all this Du Bois fascinatingly explored (making use of
German ethnographer Friedrich Ratzel's writings) before tracking the
African and his/her church and family into New World slavery. Hauled
down from their auction blocks in Charleston, Baltimore, or Alexandria,
Virginia, Africans in America transferred their obedience from the
homeland chief to the new white master, Du Bois wrote, as they lost ties
of family and clan and arrived chained and disoriented ""on a plot of
ground, with common rules and customs, common dwellings, and a certain
communism in property."" The power of the chief now became vested in an
alien figure whose will to exploit, punish, and debauch was restrained
primarily by self-interest. African-Americans had withstood three
centuries of bondage in a state of denatured personality, family, and
morality. A true disciple of Crummell, Du Bois rendered a condign
verdict on slavery's debasement of black women, its corruption of black
men, and its infection of every institution emerging from it---condign
but not merciless. ""At first sight it would seem that slavery completely
destroyed every vestige of spontaneous social movement among the
Negroes,"" his argument ran. ""Home had deteriorated; political authority
and economic initiative was in the hands of the masters, property as a
social institution did not exist on the plantation.""

Historians and sociologists assumed that ""every vestige of internal
development disappeared, leaving the slaves no means of expression for
their common life,"" but Du Bois stopped short of making the southern
plantation experience the equivalent of a lobotomy. ""This is not
strictly true."" Africa had come to the rescue in the form of religious
survivals in the Americas: the African priest lived on in the New World
preacher. ""It is this historic fact that the Negro Church of today bases
itself upon the sole surviving social institution of the African
fatherland that accounts for its extraordinary growth and
vitality.""[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-25){#cha-25} The
surviving church was to play the dialectical role of resurrecting the
family, in a nuclear, monogamous form, in African-American life. The new
family institution would then speed the modernization of the church,
which Du Bois somewhat cautiously implied was still much too parochial.
With notable contributions on northern conditions from reformers Jane
Addams and Mary White Ovington, ""The Negro American Family"" report
concluded that the African-American was ""farthest behind modern
civilization in his sexual [mores.]{.epub-i}"" Concupiscence engendered
during slavery now preyed upon the African-American family in freedom,
he contended, seriously inhibiting its adjustment to modern
middle-class, Protestant norms. ""More primitive, less civilized, in this
respect, than his surroundings demand,... his family life less efficient
for its onerous social duties, his womanhood less protected, his
children more poorly trained,"" all this was ""to be expected,""
sociologist Du Bois concluded, because ""this is what slavery
meant.""[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-26){#cha-26}

With ""The Negro Artisan"" of 1902, ""The Negro Church"" of 1903, and
especially ""The Negro American Family"" of 1908, Du Bois would push the
Atlanta University Studies to the frontier of American social science
research, virtually single-handedly and under the auspices of an
institution whose revenues had become so skimpy that the average \$5,000
cost of the conferences and publications (Du Bois's \$1,200 salary
included) gave President Bumstead and the trustees annual budgetary
heartburn. Except for Carnegie manna to build its library in 1903,
Atlanta University found itself generally bypassed by the philanthropic
foundations. The predicament was puzzling, and seemed somehow the
product of a conspiracy. William Garrison's youngest son, Francis
Jackson Garrison of the prestigious Boston publishing house of Houghton
Mifflin (still imbued with the old abolitionist values), wrote nephew
Oswald Villard in May 1902 that this situation was outrageous. ""I groan
in spirit every time I read of a legacy or gift of \$50,000 and
\$100,000 or \$500,000 going to Harvard or Yale, or Columbia, or
Chicago,"" when a fraction of those sums to a deserving Atlanta
University could make a life-or-death
difference.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-27){#cha-27}

Whatever the reasons for the foundations' cold shoulder, the underfunded
conferences achieved increasing celebrity. Lyman Abbott's influential
[Outlook,]{.epub-i} a consistent booster of Washington and his Tuskegee
Idea, noticed Du Bois's labors as early as January 1898, praising the
first social-betterment study as ""a valuable sociological publication.""
Three years later, the London [Spectator]{.epub-i} applauded the
social-science work ""being done with much intelligence, discrimination,
and assiduity at the insistence and under the inspiration of Atlanta
University."" [Publications of the Southern History Association]{.epub-i}
echoed the [Spectator]{.epub-i} four years later, calling Du Bois's work
the ""most admirable investigations into this vast ethnic problem."" By
then, even the [American Journal of Sociology]{.epub-i} had called the
Negro artisan monograph the ""most exhaustive study thus far made of the
economic aspects of the problem."" Other endorsements followed, but,
curiously, it was to be [The Outlook']{.epub-i}s second Atlanta notice
in 1903 that topped them all, decreeing that ""no student of the race
problem, no person who would either think or speak upon it
intelligently, can afford to be ignorant of the facts brought out in the
Atlanta series."" The [Chicago Tribune]{.epub-i} sent the roving Clifford
Raymond to interview Du Bois in his South Hall rooms in June of that
year. Raymond's ""Cultured Negro Model for Race"" was a lyrical portrait
of the young professor---""one of the most entertaining men I ever talked
with."" The professor's intelligence and culture Raymond attributed to
mixed racial ancestry.[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-28){#cha-28}

In demand as commencement and learned-society speaker, national
newspaper and magazine contributor, congressional commission witness,
U.S. Department of Labor consultant and author (""The Negro Landholder of
Georgia"" \[1901\] and ""The Negro Farmer"" \[1906\]), Du Bois was becoming
the second most sought-after spokesperson for his race after Booker
Washington. Scholars and public figures began turning up for the May
meetings or simply inviting themselves to the campus at their
convenience. Washington, bearing honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale,
spoke encouragingly to the 1902 assembly. Edwin R. A. Seligman, the
wealthy, distinguished Columbia University economics professor, brought
along a good number of the delegates to the 1903 annual meeting of the
American Economic Association to meet Du Bois when their train halted
for a few hours on Sunday, December
27.[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-29){#cha-29} Spellbinding
Washington Gladden, the Billy Graham of the day, addressed the 1903
conference in his capacity as president of the American Missionary
Association. Gladden departed so impressed by Du Bois and his work that
he wondered in print whether the Tuskegee program deserved its monopoly.
""All that Booker Washington is doing we may heartily rejoice in; but
there are other things that must not be left undone,"" advised Gladden,
paying Du Bois the compliment of being ""perhaps the most cultivated man
among American Negroes."" Max Weber came to campus to participate in the
conference on crime during his American visit in 1904. The great German
sociologist had no recollection of Du Bois the Berlin student, but he
wrote commending the Atlanta professor's researches and hoped to run a
""short review of the recent publications about the race problem in
America"" in the [Archiv fur Sozialwissenschaft und
Sozialpolitik,]{.epub-i} which he
did.[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-30){#cha-30} The year closed
with a French version of a Du Bois essay appearing as ""L'Ouvrier negre
en AmÃ©rique"" in the influential periodical [La Revue Ã©conomique
internationale.]{.epub-i} The following year, William James dropped a
note to Du Bois about the most recent study. ""I wish the portraits might

W[ITH TWO]{.epub-sc} large, critically acclaimed monographs published by
age thirty-one, a major essay in Weber's arbitral [Archiv]{.epub-i} at
thirty-seven, his scholarship discussed in large-circulation newspapers
and middlebrow periodicals, and his Stone Hall office becoming a
stopping-off point for the famous, the influential, and the merely
curious on southern learning safaris, Du Bois's professional
achievements placed him in the vanguard of social-science scholarship in
America. Atlanta seemed admirably positioned to become the great
research center he had come from Philadelphia to make it. Foundation
grants had not materialized so far, and he could have no inkling in the
first few years of his eventual failure to win their full support; yet
Du Bois had already begun to feel dissatisfied. Having made an
international reputation as a social scientist and historian, the
Atlanta University professor found himself becoming impatient that the
world went along as before, unreconstructed in its rabid racism in the
South and in its sublime cynicism in the North, and leaving his own
material and professional prospects about as much unchanged.

It was the bitterest of revelations to a Calvinist and a Hegelian that
scientific truth, repeatedly broadcast, was apparently impotent to
ameliorate collective behavior. For all his professions of value-free
and policy-neutral investigation, his rhetoric about isolated groups and
human laboratories, Du Bois was temperamentally averse to moral
relativism---there was always the [right]{.epub-i} way to do a
thing---and Hegelian Du Bois expected right ideas to become social
forces within a reasonable time frame. He began to realize how
intractable the here-and-now society beyond the conference walls of Ware
Chapel was, even before he published the second Atlanta University Study
in 1899. He had ""overworked a theory---that the cause of the problem was
the ignorance of people."" He now saw that ""the cure wasn't simply
telling people the truth, it was inducing them to act on the
truth.""[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-32){#cha-32} It was not
enough to determine truth scientifically; it had to be implemented
politically. His mission to mobilize truth in order to alter behavior
took on sudden urgency in the spring and summer of 1899.

In the autobiographical writings, Du Bois underscores a ghastly incident
that shook him to his core during this period---the April lynching of
Sam Hose. Hose was a farmer in Palmetto, a few miles outside Atlanta,
who had shot and killed a white farmer after an argument over a debt.
Justice was summary, ghoulish. After lynching and burning Hose to death,
the white mob of two thousand men, women, and children had fought over
pieces of his flesh for souvenirs. ""Startled to his feet"" by the
lynching, Du Bois gathered up his cane and gloves and descended from
South Hall into West Mitchell Street with a letter of introduction to
the editor of the [Constitution,]{.epub-i} Joel Chandler Harris. Another
envelope contained his restrained letter on the lynching, intended for
the editorial page. Until he was told, as he hurried downtown, Du Bois
was unaware that Hose had been barbecued and that his blackened knuckles
were on display in a white storeowner's window farther along Mitchell
Street. Numbed by the horror, he retraced his steps to the university
and, he recalled with soul-weary solemnity, ""began to turn aside from my
work.""[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-33){#cha-33} From that moment
forward, he recognized that ""one could not be a calm, cool, and detached
scientist while Negroes were lynched, murdered and starved."" A few
months later, he commented in the New York [Independent]{.epub-i} on the
terrible setbacks that had ""followed faster and faster in the last ten
years""---the bloody 1898 Wilmington, North Carolina, riot, the mob
murder of a black postmaster, the epidemic of lynchings leading up to
Hose. Fourteen years of preparation, research, and writing suddenly
seemed mockingly irrelevant. ""There was no such definite demand for
scientific work of the sort that \[he\] was doing, as \[he\] had
confidently assumed would be easily
forthcoming.""[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-34){#cha-34}

Brooding about his career, the butchering of Sam Hose, and the impotence
of social science to improve society, Du Bois was suddenly struck
broadside by a great personal tragedy. The death of Burghardt was an
agony of such devastation that he would soon try to recast it in
eschatological terms. In ""Of the Passing of the First-Born,"" the
apostrophe in [The Souls of Black Folk,]{.epub-i} Du Bois would make
Burghardt's life and death monumentally symbolic. Like another birth
nearly two thousand years earlier, his son's coming foretold eventual
deliverance of a people, symbolizing faith in some ultimate
transcendence of the Veil by the African-American millions. Du Bois's
lofty intent is manifest in his Adoration-of-the-Magi imagery: ""A
perfect life was his, all joy and love, with tears to make it
brighter---sweet as a summer's day beside the Housatonic. The world
loved him; the women kissed his curls, the men looked gravely into his
wonderful eyes, and the children hovered and fluttered about him."" He
and Nina had felt vague unrest when they brought their child onto the
""hot red soil of Georgia."" ""I saw the shadow of the Veil as it passed
over my baby, I saw the cold city towering above the blood-red land,""
laments the father. Even so, Burghardt grew so ""sturdy and masterful,""
""with his hair tinted with gold,"" that they were not far from
""worshipping this revelation of the divine."" Burghardt was his mother's
reason for being. ""Her own life builded and moulded itself upon the
child."" Du Bois permits himself one flash of bitter, understandable
self-pity in a passage about his own obduracy in the face of racial
prejudice. In the ""dull land that stretches its sneering web about
\[him\],"" was not ""all the world beyond these four little walls pitiless
enough"" that ""\[Death\] must needs enter here?"" Remorse then gives way
to philosophical reflection. ""Well sped, my boy, before their world had
dubbed your ambition insolence, had held your ideals unattainable, and
taught you to cringe and bow."" Death within the Veil awaited the father,
but surely through Burghardt ""there shall yet dawn some mighty morning
to lift the Veil and set the prisoned
free.""[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-35){#cha-35}

The elegiac prose of ""The Passing of the First-Born"" verges on bathos
today. The plain facts are that Burghardt contracted nasopharyngeal
diphtheria, grew progressively feverish, and died ten days later on May
24, 1899, a Wednesday, at sundown. He was two years and almost one month
old. The night before, Du Bois had rushed out in a futile search for one
of the two or three black physicians living on the other side of town.
Although the elegy to Burghardt mentions Nina's grief (""in the chamber
of death writhed the world's most piteous thing---a childless mother""),
the supreme focus of the tragedy is Du Bois. ""If one must have gone, why
not \[he\]?"" Burghardt's death is presented as Du Bois's calamity and,
by extension, the race's, with Nina playing merely a supporting role.
There is no doubt about the authenticity of Du Bois's pain, but it was
Nina's emotional health that was permanently affected. As his wife, she
understood why Will's work had brought them to a city practically devoid
of doctors of their own race---a city where white physicians refused to
treat even desperately sick black children. But as a mother, Nina would
never forgive him.

Writing Nina's obituary a half century later, Du Bois would finally face
the truth that, with their son's death, ""in a sense my wife died too.
Never after that was she quite the same in her attitude toward life and
the world.""[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-36){#cha-36} The nature
of Will and Nina's early married life and the circumstances surrounding
their son's death can be tentatively reconstructed even from a great
distance in time. Burghardt's ten-day ordeal coincided with Du Bois's
final arrangements for the May 30--31 conference on ""The Negro in
Business""---in effect, the first of the Atlanta conferences to which he
put his stamp. The fact that he presided over these deliberations six
days after burying his son in Great Barrington's Mahaiwe Cemetery, while
a wrecked Nina remained behind in the Berkshires, testifies to the iron
self-control and intellectual purpose typical of Du Bois. But it also
suggests that his attention to Burghardt's symptoms was probably less
than optimal, and that he accepted too readily a reassuring bad-cold
diagnosis of the toxins slowly invading the boy's throat and intestines.
""Of the Passing of the First-Born"" leaves no doubt that medical help was
inadequate (whether in fact it may not even have been available is less
clear). The confession long afterward that Burghardt might have been
saved ""had we been persons of greater experience"" further suggests his
lack of focus until it was too late. The German immunologist Emil von
Behring's diphtheria antitoxin was being experimentally tested on
animals at that time. Another dozen years would pass, however, before
its general administration to
humans.[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-37){#cha-37} But Du Bois may
well have known of its existence, and such knowledge would have festered
in his and Nina's vague guilt.

The lynching of Sam Hose outside Atlanta in April, followed in May by
their son's burial in Great Barrington, depressed both of them. Nina's
aversion to the South turned into a visceral loathing. White people had
turned to call them ""niggers"" as she and Will walked behind the
horse-drawn cart carrying Burghardt's coffin to the Atlanta train
station.[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-38){#cha-38} Even as praise
for the fourth Atlanta University study arrived, Du Bois must have felt
already that he had to find a position elsewhere. Atlanta was like a
poisoned well, polluted with the remains of Sam Hose and reflecting the
drawn image of Burghardt from its dark surface. The psychological
punishment of the place was so severe at that time that Du Bois would
claim years afterward that he had actually suffered a nervous breakdown.
Before their son's death, Tuskegee had still seemed worth exploring. An
offer there was much more problematic now, given Nina's state of mind,
but it did afford the solace of escape from Atlanta, a larger salary,
and the prospect of a well-endowed institution's full support of his
researches. He and Washington had finally met face to face in Boston
that March when President Bumstead had asked Du Bois to make a number of
fund-raising speeches in New England on behalf of the university. Rather
than have Du Bois's Boston appearance compete with his own \$150,000
campaign, Washington had suggested to Bumstead that Du Bois appear with
himself on the same platform along with Paul Laurence
Dunbar.[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-39){#cha-39}

The Tuskegee principal gave a standard speech at the Hollis Street
Theatre in Boston on the twenty-first, in which he decried the loss of
civil rights in the South mainly because of the harm done to white civic
virtue. ""The Negro can afford to be wronged,"" Washington explained; ""the
white man cannot afford to wrong him without the proudest and bluest
blood in your civilization being degraded."" A few days away from his
forty-third birthday, the principal was on the verge of physical and
nervous exhaustion. At Tuskegee, he kept watch day and night over
students, faculty, administrators, townspeople, and, above all, the
endless stream of white people who came from North and South to probe
and praise his fragile miracle in the Alabama Black Belt. But as his
fame had grown, his opportunities and obligations, as the leader of the
Negro people, were redoubled. He had lately spent as much time in
Pullman cars, hurtling from one speaking engagement and power caucus to
another throughout the United States, as in Tuskegee. Booker
Washington's yellow complexion had grown even sallower, his gaze more
opaque, and his often hoarse voice markedly lacking in crispness. The
Hollis Street audience gave Du Bois and Dunbar the loudest applause that
evening, and, as Du Bois recalled, Washington's friends ""immediately
raised a fund which sent him to Europe for three months
rest.""[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-40){#cha-40}

Upstaged or not, Washington returned to America well disposed toward the
Atlanta professor. Another letter from Albert Hart pressing a Du Bois
appointment (Hart called Du Bois ""a striking refutation of some of the
hardest things said about the negro race"") was on his desk. Resigning
from Atlanta University in the middle of the summer would have been
thoroughly improper, but on July 12, Du Bois replied with encouragement
to Washington's suggestion that he consider coming to Tuskegee in the
academic year 1900--1901, writing that he would ""decide during the
winter as to whether I think a change best for all interests.""
Washington's offer must have been rather vague because Du Bois also
asked to ""hearÂ ... more definitely as to the work you would expect and
the salary."" His social-science needs were almost laughably modest,
after all, and the ""dream was still splendid,"" he reflected long
afterward. ""If in a properly equipped institution I could have gathered
four or five well-equipped young students, some tabulating machines and
a small corps of travelling investigators,... at a cost of \$10,000 to
\$25,000 a year,"" he was certain that he could perfect the scientific
study of the American
Negro.[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-41){#cha-41} Washington
seemed to be edging toward a formal offer. As different as the two men
were, their contrasting temperaments had actually tended to make them
politely curious about each other. Washington had been generally
complimentary of Du Bois, while Du Bois had publicly championed the
cause of the Tuskegee educator on more than one occasion.

When the now-forgotten National Afro-American Council met in Chicago in
late August 1899, there was trouble for Washington. The Afro-American
Council was an outgrowth of an organization founded in 1887 by the
brilliant T. Thomas Fortune, the lanky, alcoholic New York newspaperman
who had given the teenaged Du Bois his first crack at journalism. The
council did little, but the membership of its twenty-three state
chapters embraced many of Afro-America's most prominent names. Enraged
by his equivocation over the Sam Hose lynching and by his continual
sightings of silver linings in every racial dark cloud, a militant
minority noisily denounced Washington and his wife. AME minister Reverdy
Cassius Ransom, whose gaunt appearance called to mind one of El Greco's
martyrs, demanded the leader's expulsion from membership. Washington's
supporters had been seized by apoplexy, and, in the ensuing hubbub, Du
Bois stood out as one of Washington's loudest defenders, voting with the
majority for a resolution excusing him from participation in
organizational discussion ""which might be radical in its utterances to
the destruction of his usefulness in connection with many
causes.""[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-42){#cha-42}

In the aftermath of the Afro-American Council imbroglio, Washington's
private secretary and principal lieutenant, the fastidious Emmett J.
Scott, described by Washington's biographer as a ""delicate-looking
yellow man with a pince-nez,"" was delighted to inform his vacationing
employer somewhat later that ""Du Bois and others sustain you well in the
Chicago [Record.]{.epub-i}"" It was a curious role for Du Bois to play.
Given his sympathy for the deceased Crummell's educational ideas and his
own anger over Hose's mob murder, Du Bois ought to have shared some of
the militants' doubts about Washington's leadership. Moreover, the
affinity that later developed between himself and the slightly older,
imperious Reverdy Ransom, one of Wilberforce's most brilliant graduates,
likely dated from the Chicago fracas. Still, Du Bois's behavior in
Chicago was not entirely (or even mainly) a question of bald opportunism
(he would have dismissed such a suspicion): for all Washington's
silences, evasions, and panderings, Du Bois knew that the race leader
occasionally departed from the pattern of accommodation that had served
him so well. In Chicago the year before, with President McKinley and his
cabinet on the speakers' platform, Washington had told the large Peace
Jubilee audience that the patriotic sacrifice of his race in the
just-concluded Spanish-American War deserved meaningful recognition,
bluntly warning of the southern ""cancer gnawing at the heart of the
Republic, that shall one day prove as dangerous as an attack from an
army without or within."" Then there were Washington's open letters that
year to Governor ""Pitchfork Ben"" Tillman of South Carolina and the
Louisiana legislature vainly imploring both to impose the same franchise
restrictions on white people as on black. Possibly, Du Bois had heard
that one of the last white southern paternalists, Jabez Curry of the
Slater Fund, had met with Washington at Tuskegee a few days before
delivering a successful entreaty to the Louisiana lawmakers not to close
the state's black public
schools.[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-43){#cha-43}

Within four months of the Afro-American Council attack, Washington took
what was for him another bold political step in Georgia against a
franchise-restriction proposal pending before the legislature---the
Hard-wick Bill. As the state's powerful Bourbon forces mobilized to
oppose the redneck radicalism behind the bill, he and Du Bois worked
parallel lobbying and public-relations strategies. Henry Proctor, the
friend from Fisk days and now a leading Atlanta minister, made his
parsonage available to Du Bois and Washington during the crisis. ""Many a
time they came to my home, sometimes at night,"" Proctor recalled. On
November 10, the influential Atlanta [Constitution]{.epub-i} carried
Washington's deferential interview in which he objected to the bill,
although ""dread\[ing\] the idea of seeming to intrude my views too often
upon the public."" Three weeks later, [The Independent]{.epub-i}
published Du Bois's anti-Hardwick piece along with the petition he and
twenty-three prominent African-Americans in Georgia had submitted to the
legislature. Du Bois could have given the [Constitution]{.epub-i}
interview and Washington written the [Independent]{.epub-i} article.
What both men and their allies found appalling was not the bill's deep
reduction of the franchise but its unfairness in treating all classes of
African-Americans alike---its Democratic ""white"" primary, grandfather
clause (hereditary white voting rights), and fraudulent educational
qualifications. ""So far as the Hardwick Bill proposes to restrict the
right of suffrage to all who, irrespective of race and color, are
intelligent enough to vote properly,"" Du Bois's petition read, ""we
heartily endorse it.""[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-44){#cha-44}
In the end, the bill was seven years premature for Georgia, and the Du
Bois--Washington collaboration had played some small part in its defeat.

Two weeks before coming up to Atlanta from Tuskegee to plot the Hardwick
Bill strategy, Washington had finally sent Du Bois the definitive offer
that Hart had been so long urging. It was generous: a salary of \$
1,400, a ""comfortable and convenient house,"" offices, and the
institute's printing office ""wholly at your service."" Explaining that he
""would have made \[him\] this offer several years ago"" had he not felt
that Du Bois's hands would have been ""tied with routine work,"" the head
of the nation's most famous institution for the training of
African-Americans was now ready to ""make any reasonable changes"" in his
offer to woo Du Bois. When Du Bois claimed much later that, although the
offer was ""attractiveÂ ... because at Atlanta \[he\] was only getting
\$1,200 a year,"" it bothered him that ""he never could find out what he
was to do"" at Tuskegee, he was not being entirely candid. ""What I would
wish you to do,"" Washington stated without ambiguity, ""is to make your
home here and to conduct sociological studies that will prove helpful to
our people, especially in the gulf states, including both the country
districts, small towns, and
cities.""[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-45){#cha-45} Du Bois took
the offer as a long-overdue confirmation of Washington's admiration and
confidence. After all, his wonderfully evocative essay about Josie and
the Fisk teaching days in rural Tennessee, ""A Negro Schoolmaster in the
New South,"" had appeared to raves in the January [Atlantic
Monthly.]{.epub-i} Three articles followed, one after the other, in the
influential northern [Independent,]{.epub-i} on African-American crime,
the Afro-American Council meeting, and the Hardwick debate, which were
all widely commented
upon.[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-46){#cha-46} The first reviews
of [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} were appearing. By the close of
1899, he was an academic celebrity.

Ironically, it was at the very moment of seeming rapprochement between
these two colossal egos that a mutual enmity insinuated itself. Du Bois
misunderstood the deepest motives behind Washington's Tuskegee
professorship offer, while the far more influential and famous
Washington underestimated Du Bois's ability and willingness to repay
deception. It seems reasonable to speculate that moving to Tuskegee
would have had no other appeal to Nina, if at all, than that it was not
Atlanta. Apologizing for his delay and indecision on February 17, Du
Bois wrote to ask Washington if, after all, ""would not \[his\]
department be regarded by the public as a sort of superfluous addition
not quite in consonance with the fundamental Tuskegee idea?"" To reassure
himself, he accepted Washington's invitation to spend a day or two in
mid-February 1900 on the Tuskegee campus. Washington showed him every
courtesy and Du Bois supposed that he had made a favorable
impression.[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-47){#cha-47}

The actual place must have impressed him. The campus rose, improbable
and isolated, by a bend in the unpaved road just beyond its namesake
village like a mirage MIT, which in architecture and scale it resembled
more each year. Recent and current construction was everywhere,
sustained by the skill and muscle power of students whose education came
in pouring cement, carrying hods on scaffolds, wielding planes in the
carpentry shop, or in brick kilns. Between 1895 and 1900, thirteen
buildings bearing the names mostly of illustrious northern
benefactors---Phelps, Parker, Slater-Armstrong, Huntington,
Emery---sprang up. Seniors assembled demonstration houses in a flash
onstage as part of their commencement valedictory exercises. President
McKinley had come to sit on a platform of cotton bales during the winter
of 1898 while the uniformed student body marched snappily in
review.[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-48){#cha-48} Principal
Washington was a worker of near miracles and all-black Tuskegee was an
extraordinary experiment, but Du Bois was finally all but certain he
should go elsewhere.

Elsewhere was Washington, D.C. Howard University, although a ""poorly-run
establishment,"" was a ""strong possibility."" But the truly exciting
prospect, Du Bois wrote the principal immediately upon his return on
February 17, 1900, was the assistant superintendency of colored schools
of the District of Columbia. The new white public school superintendent,
described by Du Bois as ""rather eccentric,"" had pressed him to become a
candidate for the post and would press the case in person when Du Bois
came to the capital for the meeting of the American Negro Academy on
March 5. If it appeared that he was willing to trade the profession of
social scientist for that of school administrator, Du Bois probably
thought---given his vast reserves of energy and Prussian
discipline---that he could run the public schools of the District of
Columbia and still crank out periodic monographs. The reality of the
Washington position, of course, was that he would be a
functionary---albeit a well-salaried, highly respected
functionary---whose tenure was contingent upon discreet public
pronouncements. In his excitement and Nina's state of mind, these are
considerations to which he must have given little or no thought. Half a
century later, he questioned his ""fitness for such a job."" Even though
it paid twice his Atlanta salary, Du Bois claimed that he had only begun
to ""wonder if \[he\] should not accept"" when ""forces started moving in
Washington"" to take matters out of his
hands.[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-49){#cha-49} But fifty years
earlier he not only decided he wanted the position, he went after it
aggressively.

Writing to Tuskegee, he broached his options in a manner calculated to
flatter the powerful principal. Wasn't Washington the ""most useful place
of the three and could I not serve [both your cause and the general
cause of the Negro]{.epub-i} at the national capital better than
elsewhere?"" Then, on February 26, before the principal had had time to
reply, Du Bois wrote again, appealing for his endorsement for the school
superintendency. Messages had arrived, Du Bois said, urging him to
become a candidate ""before it was too late."" No, he hadn't definitely
decided against coming to Tuskegee, but his ""present leaning, however,
is toward Washington"" and the chance to do ""a great work."" On March 1,
three days later, he sent Reverend Hollis Burke Frissell, the white
chaplain who had succeeded Armstrong as principal of Hampton, a similar
message saying, if Frissell thought him ""fitted for the place, may I ask
you to send me as soon as convenient your testimonial, that I may
forward it to
Washington?""[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-50){#cha-50}

Nina probably leaned toward Washington even more than Will. It was only
a matter of weeks before her newest pregnancy was confirmed, and the
prospect of rearing another child in Atlanta must have distressed them
both. Nina could imagine strolling with the new infant in Washington's
unsegregated public parks and the zoo. Theaters were segregated, but
public transportation and the restaurants at the train station were not.
The public library, unlike Atlanta's Carnegie Library (shortly under
construction), was open to the public, irrespective of color. From Du
Bois's point of view, the national capital had almost everything:
federal agencies and the Library of Congress with countless documents
and books; Howard University, not yet the ""capstone of Negro education""
but clearly on the road to periodic excellence; and the stimulation of
the American Negro Academy (of which he was now president). The sizable,
educated African-American upper classes with their mulatto overlay were
a visible, confident, and prosperous fact of civic life. An attractive
city, Washington was like Athens to Sparta when compared to Atlanta. The
D.C. assistant superintendency of schools was one of the most estimable
and quietly influential positions available anywhere to an
African-American, a plum. Anchored to the flagship M Street High School
(the future Dunbar) with its classical curriculum, the city's segregated
black public school system was said to provide one of the best
educations in America.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-51){#cha-51}

As of July 1, 1900, new congressional legislation called for a single
superintendent (white) and two assistant superintendents (one for
""colored"" and one for ""white"" schools). Factional competition for the
""colored"" assistant superintendency was already frenetic. M Street High
School principal Robert H. Terrell, Harvard magna cum laude and Howard
Law School graduate, was an aspirant, and his formidable wife, national
clubwoman Mary Church Terrell, Oberlin-educated and regal, meant her
husband to have it. The restored Wilberforce classics scholar
Scarborough was among the contenders, as were Winfield Scott Montgomery
and Hugh M. Browne, Dartmouth alumnus and Princeton seminary man,
respectively. The long-since-vanished letter of recommendation Booker
Washington sent to Du Bois the first week in March must have been a
strong one. Hollis Frissell's letter a few days later seemed equally
enthusiastic. The Hampton principal regretted that Du Bois was tempted
by school administration---Du Bois was the ""only man that the colored
race has thus far produced"" who could turn out ""excellent historical and
sociological work""---but Frissell was ready and glad to do anything to
""help \[him\] on.""[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-52){#cha-52}
Meanwhile, the information pipeline to Tuskegee was flowing full stream;
John Wesley Ross, the white Democratic commissioner of D.C. schools,
dutifully forwarded the names of all suggested candidates to Washington.
Blow-by-blow accounts arrived in Tuskegee almost daily. Terrell was the
""most popular."" Du Bois was the ""most acceptable from a scholarly
standpoint."" It was a fight ""between Terrell and Du Bois against a minor
field."" Washington's name was mentioned, ""and it is conceded that you
could have it by a nod of
assent.""[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-53){#cha-53} Terrell was in
the lead, causing those who disliked imperious Mrs. Terrell to flock to
Du Bois---""or any outsider.""

From Atlanta came disturbing information from the venerable William A.
Pledger about Du Bois. Pledger, the self-made natural son of a Georgia
planter, was Atlanta University--trained, a lawyer, and a newspaper
editor whose service to the Republican party had brought him the
distinction in his final years of titular state party chairman. Once a
feisty civil rights militant, he was now a straddler, his editorials in
the black Atlanta [Age]{.epub-i} sometimes echoing Frederick Douglass
but more often Booker Washington. ""I am so sorry that you endorsed Du
Bois,"" Pledger moaned. ""He is not of your people. Your friends almost to
a man are against him."" He, too, claimed the people wanted either
Terrell or Washington himself. Then, within a few days, from one of the
capital's most prominent African-American physicians came a ringing
endorsement of Du Bois.[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-54){#cha-54}
Consorting with princes of finance and industry in New York, Boston, and
Saratoga, able to make and break careers with a note or a nod, Booker
Washington was much too important now to become a Washington bureaucrat.
He did not need or want Washington, D.C., but it now seemed that his
backing of Du Bois could jeopardize his own influence in the capital. T.
Thomas Fortune and another of Washington's most trusted lieutenants,
D.C. insider, newspaperman, and government clerk Richard W. Thompson,
pleaded with Washington to throw his support to Principal Terrell in
order to keep the appointment from going to any District
nonresident---above all to a certain William Hooper Councill, principal
of the State Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes at
Huntsville, Alabama, whose fawning over powerful whites made Booker
Washington seem positively frosty by comparison. In Washington's eyes,
the whole business had become unpredictable and distastefully
amateurish. He really should ""have consulted you before making any
move,"" he admitted to Fortune, ""then we could have all been working in
the same direction.""[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-55){#cha-55} It
was a rare lapse in appearing to back Du Bois.

Washington corrected his course. Very likely, the advice from some of
his key white northern backers confirmed what he already knew had to be
done. On March 11, the Tuskegee principal sent Du Bois a curious letter
from New York's Grand Union Hotel, where one of his periodic caucuses
with rich white trustees had just concluded:

Dear Dr. Du Bois:

Please consider the contents of this letter strictly private. If you
have not done so, I think it not best for you to use the letter of
recommendation which I have sent you. I have just received a letter
direct from one of the Commissioners in the District asking me to
recommend someone for the vacancy there and I have recommended you as
strongly as I could. Under the circumstances it would make your case
stronger not to present the letter which I have given you for the reason
that it would tend to put you in the position of seeking the position.
It is pretty well settled, judging by the Commissioner's letter, that
some one outside the District is going to be appointed.

Yours truly,

Booker T. Washington[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-56){#cha-56}

Du Bois might have heard rumors that Washington himself was a candidate
for the assistant superintendency. He certainly knew that angry
coalitions were fighting no-holds-barred against each other. But nothing
had prepared him for the patent illogic of Washington's letter and the
bad faith to be inferred from it. Instead of the strong written
endorsement committing Washington to his candidacy, Du Bois was
instructed to rely on verbal assurances that he was Washington's choice
for the post. When he heard later that one of the African-American
members of the District school board had wrangled a conference with
President Theodore Roosevelt to warn of the ""'danger' of my
appointment,"" Du Bois was absolutely convinced that what he now began to
call the ""Tuskegee Machine"" had
struck.[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter9-57){#cha-57}

trouble.""[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-1){#cha-1} Some 700,000
African-Americans registered on July 5, 1917, the first day of
enrollment under the new Selective Service Act. As tens of thousands of
these recruits reported to camps for training in Georgia, Kansas, and
Texas, [The Crisis]{.epub-i} was vigilant. It needed to be. While the
work of assembling Camp Des Moines sputtered along, the War Department
decreed that no nonwhite officers above the rank of captain would be
commissioned. Nor did the generals intend to see many snappy, Talented
Tenth graduates of Fisk, Howard, and Atlanta taking the salutes of their
men. For good measure, they dismayed Du Bois and Spingarn by decreeing
that some 250 of the African-American officers would be selected from
the ranks of regular army privates and NCOs, men who were well trained
but often barely literate and accustomed to taking orders from white
superiors.[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-2){#cha-2}

Meanwhile, the War Department packed existing and planned units
comprised of African-Americans with white officers. Reports reached Du
Bois of disgraceful conditions, harrassment by white military policemen,
white NCOs who spat ""nigger"" and ""coon"" at every opportunity, camps
lacking USO facilities available to African-American enlisted men, and
the case of a major general at Fort Riley, Kansas, Charles C. Ballou,
who confined the men of his all-black 92nd Division to camp for
insisting on admission to a movie theater in the town. ""No matter how
legally correct"" they had been, barked the general, ""the greater wrong""
was to do ""[anything,]{.epub-i} no matter how [legally]{.epub-i}
correct, that will provoke race animosity."" General Ballou was generally
believed to have meant well. The same could not be said of those
overseeing the black soldiers stationed near Houston. Then came the
rapid, one-two punch of racism that enraged Du Bois almost to the point
of abandoning his tack of patient patriotism, and which badly jarred the
White House and the War Department. ""In the very hour of our
exaltation,"" as the editor put it with his customary flair for drama,
""the whirlwind struck us again""---first in East St. Louis, Illinois,
then in Houston, Texas.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-3){#cha-3}

Du Bois had sought to examine the commencing mass migration of southern
black people in ""The Migration of Negroes,"" a taut, analytical piece
ticking off what today would be called the ""push"" and ""pull"" of
economic, demographic, and social factors driving ""about 250,000""
northward in little more than a year. From his ""own travel and
observation,"" he sensed the epic consequences that would result from
this relocation. Some 2,400 African-Americans had been pushed and pulled
to East St. Louis, Illinois, the ""Pittsburgh of the West,"" since the
beginning of 1916. They arrived in the midst of a heated election and an
industrial war---ripe conditions for a cataclysm. The outcome of voting
in Illinois was critical to Woodrow Wilson's reelection, and, as Du Bois
had foreseen, the rising numbers of African-Americans in the state would
affect that outcome. If there was no hard proof of the Democrats'
charges that the state GOP had imported black voters from the South in
order to capture southern Illinois, there was little doubt as to their
validity in the minds of hard-pressed white workers in East St. Louis,
the great majority of them, like the black people, newly arrived from
other parts. These white workers hated to see the Republicans take the
state, and hated even more to see Republican William Rodenberg returned
to the U. S. House of Representatives. His Democratic opponent had
railed against Rodenberg's ""Black Belt,"" the African-American shantytown
abutting the railroad tracks and industrial plants, a group of dwellings
little different from the grim, unsanitary hovels of the white
immigrants. Dr. Leroy Bundy, prosperous dentist and flamboyant
organizer, personified black Republicanism to the city's white people
and its new, bumbling Democratic mayor, Fred
Mollman.[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-4){#cha-4}

But it was the threat to white jobs from black newcomers that finally
provoked two days of the worst urban violence yet experienced in the
peacetime history of America. East St. Louis was home to the Armour and
Swift meat-packing houses and to the Aluminum Ore Company and the
Missouri Malleable Iron Company. Organized labor was reeling from its
defeat by the Aluminum Ore Company. The company paid its nonunion
workers a better wage than the average for East St. Louis; but working
conditions were brutal, and the number of African-Americans hired to
replace white workers had risen from 280 in November to 410 in December.
By February 1917 there were 470 working at the plant---all but a handful
in jobs at the lowest rungs of production. Fighting back desperately
against the successful demolition of its union, the AFL tried to
reorganize with the support of unskilled white labor. The union
exaggerated trends that the Slavic and southern European workers already
feared were irreversibly under way. Armour, Swift, and Morris, the large
meat-packing companies, hardly bothered to hire black workers because
union organizing had gone nowhere in the packing houses. Should the need
arise, however, the precedent set by Aluminum Ore was certain to be
copied. White skilled labor told its unskilled brothers that it could
either strike with the union or step aside to make room for more black
newcomers arriving on the Illinois
Central.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-5){#cha-5}

On May 29 and 30, the tinder of politics and jobs ignited, then rapidly
flamed out with little damage done because of the presence of the
National Guard. One month later, on the night of July 1, however, the
conflagration came, after a car filled with plainclothes police was
fired upon by African-Americans who probably mistook it for returning
drive-by shooters. The city exploded the next morning. More than six
thousand men, women, and children were made homeless and many fled the
city in the first hours or would return under the protection of the
National Guard to root for their few belongings before departing
forever. Two policemen died and two square blocks of black shanties went
up in flames. All day long on the third, white people roamed the
downtown area, exchanging souvenirs from the rampage, ghoulishly touring
the morgues, and cheering whenever an increase in the black body count
was announced. Mangled black corpses (""horribly mutilated floaters"")
bobbed to the surface of the Mississippi. By July 5, almost \$400,000
worth of property had been destroyed and thirty-nine black and eight
white people were dead. The final tally was grim enough---Du Bois would
insist until the end on 125 fatalities---but the first reports he
received counted several hundred dead, with untold numbers of bodies yet
to be disgorged by Cahokia Creek and the
Mississippi.[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-6){#cha-6} And whether
it was \$373,605 or, as initial reports calculated, \$1.4 to \$3 million
in houses and businesses lost, the ghastly reality remained that this
northern city of 59,000 had been the site of the first American pogrom.

With the board's full backing, Du Bois left for East St. Louis on
Sunday, July 8, with Martha Gruening, the aggressive white social worker
who served as field agent and [Crisis]{.epub-i} staffer. From offices
provided by the Knights of Pythias, an African-American mutual-aid
society, he and Gruening issued orders to a staff of five hired workers
and twenty-five volunteers during their seven working days there. They
were a formidable duo, with Du Bois canvassing the African-American
community with something of the lightning speed and thoroughness of his
Philadelphia days, and Gruening doing skillful detective work in the
white community. Mayor Mollman squirmed through an exacting session with
Du Bois, and city and state officials found themselves interrogated with
a civil intensity distinctly not to their liking, as they sought to
assign blame for the riot on a conspiracy headed by Dr. Bundy, the
African-American dentist. The NAACP board members convening to hear the
editor's report were grimly impressed by what he and his assistant had
uncovered. Given the national implications of the terrible riot and the
intrepid fact-finding by its agents, only William Walling expressed
surprise when Du Bois relieved [The Crisis]{.epub-i} of sharing in the
East St. Louis expenses and presented the full \$350 bill to the NAACP
along with a motion (eventually approved) to deduct the sum from its
recently established Antilynching
Fund.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-7){#cha-7}

While he and Gruening amassed information (eighty-two white and
twenty-three black people were indicted on August 14) in order to draft
their public report, Du Bois prompted Jessie Fauset to send the letter
""A Negro on East St. Louis"" to the [Survey.]{.epub-i} She sounded like
the editor at his pontifical sternest: ""We are perfectly well aware that
the outlook for us is not encouraging.... We, the American Negroes are
the acid test for occidental civilization. If we perish, we perish. But
when we fall, we shall fall like Samson, dragging inevitably with us the
pillars of a nation's democracy."" Fauset's letter sought to put a bold
face upon the numb discouragement of a people. Although there was
widespread handwringing in northern newspapers, followed by crocodile
editorials throughout the South, black Americans began, as never before,
to fear that they were an endangered species. On the left, as Du Bois
would write in ""The Problem of Problems,"" organized labor found ""killing
Negroes a safe, lucrative
employment.""[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-8){#cha-8} At a
Carnegie Hall meeting organized to applaud the revolution in Russia,
Gompers excused the white workers of East St. Louis, although Du Bois
was pleased to note that Theodore Roosevelt had rebuked the AFL head
from the platform. On the right, the New Freedom implemented much of the
Progressive agenda, but consistently ignored African-Americans when it
was not proscribing them. A delegation of prominent citizens from
Baltimore was turned away from the White House without a hearing. James
Weldon Johnson managed to see Tumulty, who testified that reading
accounts of the riot had sickened him physically, but his lofty superior
remained silent.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-9){#cha-9}

It was Villard who suggested another means of getting through to Woodrow
Wilson---a silent parade of thousands in Manhattan. The preliminary
planning of the demonstration fell to Johnson (Nash was on leave) until
Du Bois arrived from East St. Louis on the eighteenth. Ten days later,
Saturday morning, July 28, between eight and ten thousand well-dressed
African-American men, women, and children marched down Fifth Avenue. It
seems inconceivable today that this was the first time a procession such
as this had ever been seen in New York City. The women and children were
dressed in white. The men wore dark suits. They marched silently, except
for the steady roll of muffled drums carried by several men at the head.
Du Bois strode in the second rank behind the drummers, walking stick in
his left hand and suit coat unbuttoned to the summer heat. Banners
demanded: [MR. PRESIDENT, WHY NOT MAKE AMERICA SAFE FOR
DEMOCRACY]{.epub-sc}?---A child's sign read [MOTHER, DO LYNCHERS GO TO
HEAVEN]{.epub-sc}? Behind the Stars and Stripes floated the giant
streamer, [YOUR HANDS ARE FULL OF
BLOOD]{.epub-sc}.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-10){#cha-10} The
Silent Parade, captured in a widely reprinted photograph, was the second
impressive sign (after the picketing of Griffith's film) that there
existed an aggressive national civil rights organization representing
black people.

Du Bois and Gruening's ""The Massacre of East St. Louis"" in the September
[Crisis]{.epub-i} pushed circulation almost to the long-coveted
fifty-thousand mark. The January 1916 issue had narrowly escaped
destruction from a fire at the printer's. This issue threatened a
conflagration. The feature essay was prefaced by the editorial ""Awake
America,"" with the prophet Jeremiah and the avenger John Brown lending
inspiration. ""The New Freedom cannot survive if it means Waco, Memphis
and East St. Louis,"" Du Bois warned. Lynching must stop. Race and gender
disfranchisement must stop. Jim Crow cars must go. Racism in trade
unions, civil service, public schools, and public accommodations must
end. Justice must be done in the courts and ability recognized in the
workplace---the litany lost nothing in power for being familiar. ""Awake!
Put on thy strength, America---put on thy beautiful robes,"" Du Bois
intoned in biblical accents intended to mask shaken confidence. ""Russia
has abolished the ghetto---shall we restore it? India is overthrowing
caste---shall we upbuild it? China is establishing democracy---shall we
strengthen our Southern oligarchy?"" His closing sentence would be
repeated in thousands of churches and homes, becoming both slogan and
catechism for African-Americans: ""No land that loves to lynch 'niggers'
can lead the hosts of Almighty
God.""[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-11){#cha-11}

When readers turned to ""The Massacre of East St. Louis"" they faced
twenty-four pages of investigative journalism that re-created the riot
through photographs and victim interviews. These verbatim testimonies
and black and white images of mayhem and arson combined to convey an
experience just short of actually being in the ravaged city, missing
only the stench of fire and death. Du Bois and Gruening applied
themselves to fleshing out the socioeconomics of the riot: the desperate
conditions driving African-Americans from the South; the widespread
disaffection among already brutalized white workers; manipulation by
capital of both races in order to break the unions; and the
understandable collusion of black workers with management in reaction to
organized labor's racism. It was clear that East St. Louis hardened Du
Bois's animus for organized labor in general and Gompers's AFL in
particular. Socialist though he continued to proclaim himself, he must
have hooted at [The Messenger]{.epub-i} when Randolph and Owen wrote
that it was the stifling of class solidarity by capital rather than the
force of racism that was behind East St.
Louis.[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-12){#cha-12} Seeing the riot
mainly in racial terms rather than as a brutal manifestation of the
capitalist divide-and-conquer maneuver, Du Bois would later succumb to
the temptation to romanticize the facts. When ""The Massacre of East St.
Louis"" was reprinted three years later, in a drastically revised form,
as ""Of Work and Wealth,"" it contained a famous paragraph describing a
confrontation that never occurred:

The Negroes fought. They grappled with the mob like beasts at bay. They
drove them back from the thickest cluster of their homes and piled the
white dead on the street, but the cunning mob caught the black men
between the factories and their homes, where they knew they were armed
only with their dinner pails. Firemen, policemen, and militiamen stood
with hanging hands or even joined eagerly with the
mob.[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-13){#cha-13}

The editor must have considered the propaganda value of this passage to
outweigh by far the sacrifice of historical accuracy. It captured the
kind of desperate, ennobling resistance to oppression he had admired in
the Irish conspirators behind the Easter Rebellion.

Houston struck as the month drew to a close. On the night of August 23,
more than one hundred soldiers from the 3rd Battalion of the decorated
24th Infantry marched from Camp Logan into Houston, Sergeant Vida Henry
and Corporal Charles W. Baltimore of the military police in the lead.
That morning, Corporal Baltimore had been beaten, shot at, and then
arrested by a city policeman for inquiring about another battalion
member, who had been clapped into jail for trying to stop the beating of
a black woman by a policeman. Both men had been released to their white
captain later in the day. After weeks of insults, assaults, Jim Crow
trolleys and cinemas, the African-American regulars of the 24th
Infantry, used to the kinder racial mores of Manila, California, and
Wyoming, cut through downtown Houston like a
scythe.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-14){#cha-14} Moving in
assault formation on the nearest police station, they shot dead sixteen
whites (including five policemen) and wounded eleven others in two
hours. Two black citizens were killed. Four members of the 3rd Battalion
died, one, Sergeant Henry, by his own hand. Here was fulfillment of
white America's deepest fear---bloody black retribution, the other
element besides sex at dead center of the historic psychosis about race.

Houston was awkward for Du Bois. As he wrote of it, the editor was
brokenhearted. It was hard, he said, ""for one of Negro blood to write of
Houston. Is not the ink within the very wells crimsoned with the blood
of black martyrs? Do they not cry unavenged, saying---Always WE pay;
always WE die; always whether right or
wrong.""[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-15){#cha-15} Whatever
feelings of elation he may have harbored about retribution for East St.
Louis, they were more than counterbalanced by fear of what white
backlash from Houston could do to the larger cause of civil rights. The
officers' camp and black troops in combat units were at stake, not to
mention the prospect of more East St. Louises exploding in reaction to
the reaction. ""This, at least, remember you who jump to judgment,"" Du
Bois implored, ""Houston was not an ordinary outburst."" That was
certainly evident, and what he meant to say was that only extraordinary
provocation could have caused this highly decorated unit to run berserk.
""Contrary to all military precedent the Negro provost guard had been
disarmed and was at the mercy of citizen police."" As Martha Gruening
(this time on her own) uncovered the facts that would go into a
compelling exposÃ©, as Sam Houston's son accepted the NAACP's retainer to
defend the soldiers, the army rushed the first sixty-three through
secret courts-martial, hanging the first batch without right of appeal
in December. Newton Baker persuaded Woodrow Wilson to reduce the total
number of soldiers hanged from twenty-four to nineteen, despite the
demands of southern senators for even more object lessons. Sixty-seven
others were given sentences ranging from a few years to life. Much
later, citing Pershing's earlier praise of the 24th Infantry, the editor
wrote bitterly of the summary punishment meted out to those who had
""volunteered to a man to clean up the yellow fever camps when others
hesitated"" in Cuba. Ultimately, there seemed no other recourse but to
fall back upon a biblical caution---""if those guiltless of their black
brothers' blood shot the punishing shot, there would be no dead men in
that regiment.""[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-16){#cha-16}

Emmett Scott, shadow figure behind the Wizard, was the African-American
chosen by the Wilson administration to advise the secretary of war on
""Negro affairs"" and to oversee the training and morale of troops. Scott
was the classic subordinate type---fastidious, resourceful, and
non-threatening. As Young went into excruciating retirement in Ohio,
Scott, disappointed and surprised at not being chosen to succeed
Washington, took up his consolation prize in an office in the Department
of Interior. Scott's note of December 1, letting Du Bois know that he
had ""personally presented to Secretary Baker the last issue of [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} with your editorial referring to him,"" was an
encouraging sign that the spirit of Amenia still lived. Baker's conduct
thus far had been fairer than one would have expected from a member of
Wilson's cabinet, the editor had written. But a few days later, Du Bois
sensed that skulduggery was afoot. Villard had learned of the chief of
staff's confidential plan to assign at least 70 percent of the
African-American draftees to labor service and stevedore units,
preventing the great majority from bearing arms and seeing action under
fire. Except for a limited number of corporals, all officers and
noncommissioned officers in the labor units (Pershing suggested renaming
them Service of Supply, ""SOS"") would be white. ""I can't think this is
true,"" Du Bois wrote Baker. The secretary's reply of December 13 was one
long exercise in obfuscation. When Scott followed up Baker's letter with
a tortured evasion of the army's racial policy for the labor units, Du
Bois replied that other sources had confirmed the army's plans. ""It is
shameful,"" he snapped. ""What can be done about it?"" The special
assistant for Negro Affairs fell silent, at least for the moment.
Meanwhile, there were equally dispiriting reports from Camp Des Moines
confirming what young career sergeant George Schuyler had found after
his assignment as an instructor there---that ""none of the prescribed
courses of study given at other (white) camps were given to the colored
candidates.""[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-17){#cha-17}

After all the controversy and suspicions about standards, Camp Des
Moines graduated its first class of officers on October 15, an extra
month having been tacked on to their ninety-day training period. Until
the end, the actual commissioning of any of the 1,250 men had remained
doubtful. His credibility on the line as never before, Du Bois insisted
on seeing Baker ""for his \[Baker's\] soul's good"" (as he jested to
Archibald GrimkÃ©) at the end of September. As he recalled the exchange
at the War Department, the secretary asserted stonily that the army was
not ""trying by this war to settle the Negro problems."" ""True,"" Du Bois
retorted, ""but you are trying to settle as much of it as interferes with
winning the war."" With 106 captains, 329 first lieutenants, and 204
second lieutenants having joined their units in October, the editor
unsuccessfully urged the War Department to create a second camp for
African-American officer
candidates.[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-18){#cha-18}

Now that the right had been won to die discriminated against in the war
for world democracy, Du Bois momentarily stood back from the fray to
write another synoptic piece akin to ""The African Roots of the War.""
Once again, he said what no other public figure, irrespective of race,
thought or wanted to say---that the future of Africa was one of the most
important questions ""to be answered after this war."" He presumed that
several centuries of exploitation had made it psychologically
implausible for Europeans to be other than indifferent or silent about
the fate of Africa---and ""of something between 150,000,000 and
200,000,000 human beings?"" Yet, Africa (""The Negro's Fatherland,"" as the
essay in the November [Survey]{.epub-i} was titled) was playing a role
exactly analogous to that of Africa in America. ""Negro troops have saved
France,"" he wrote, with the First Battle of the Marne in mind. ""They
have conquered German Africa. They and their American Negro brothers are
helping to save
Belgium.""[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-19){#cha-19} If the
franchise and the erosion of Jim Crow were dividends that
African-Americans would reasonably expect in return for their services,
then a ""great free central African state"" was a reasonable form of
compensation for what Du Bois called ""the terrible world history between
1441 and 1861,"" roughly the span of the Atlantic slave trade. ""Surely
after Belgium has suffered almost as much from Germany as Africa has
suffered from her,"" Du Bois proposed, going well beyond the resolutions
of the first Pan-African Congress of 1900, ""she ought be willing to give
up the Congo to this end; and it would be right that England should
refrain from taking German East Africa as well as refrain from handing
it back.""[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-20){#cha-20} Like the
League of Nations envisaged by the visionary racialist in the White
House, Du Bois's postwar Africa ignored nationalism and economics. That
the author of ""The African Roots of the War"" did so in this essay was
not only because Du Bois the Victorian idealist---for all his cogent
economics---still tended to dominate Du Bois the Socialist, but also
because Du Bois often believed that he must disregard the logic of his
own economic analyses for the sake of his racial and social aspirations.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

J[ANUARY AND]{.epub-sc} February 1918 brought Du Bois two memorable
rewards. The NAACP minutes for January 14 show that he was absent when
the board took formal notice of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} finally going over
the fifty thousand mark---53,750 sold in December. January was a very
good month indeed for the editor. Perennially strapped for cash and
forced to borrow regularly from affluent admirers, he was granted a
\$3,600 annual salary by the board. Field secretary Johnson, whose work
toward organizing various branches had been immensely successful, moved
up to \$3,000, and both he and Du Bois were gratified to have their
recommendation of young Atlanta University graduate Walter Francis White
accepted as NAACP assistant
secretary.[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-21){#cha-21} In fact
there was a host of major personnel changes in January, but Du Bois's
speaking engagements kept him from most of the board meetings well into
March. At the January 7 meeting, Joel Spingarn's leave of absence as
chairman had been accepted. Appealing to Theodore Roosevelt, sundry
congressmen, Emmett Scott, and contacts within the army, during the
previous year the forty-three-year-old Spingarn had spent fretful months
seeking a waiver of the age regulation for officers, until he was
finally admitted to officer training at the beginning of May. Obtaining
the rank of infantry major after a superb response to the rigors of
training, he had been about to embark for France with his battalion from
Hoboken, New Jersey, when he was struck by a crippling attack of ulcers.
Then, in December, Troutbeck had burnt to the ground just as he was
recovering from surgery. Undaunted, Major Spingarn was now on his way to
Military Intelligence in
Washington.[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-22){#cha-22}

But not before Du Bois prevailed upon him to nominate Ovington as his
replacement, in order, he wrote tactfully, to avoid ""the usual
unpleasant candidate""---Villard. At the same meeting, Lillian Wald and
Florence Kelley had suggested a permanent replacement for Nash. The
polished and effective Johnson would have seemed an ideal successor, but
Ovington continued to believe that he lacked sufficient fire, and Wald
and Kelley would have had reservations about putting an African-American
in such a position of authority. Villard's candidate, his old classmate
and fellow pacifist, Roger Baldwin, was opposed on account of his
friendship and his
pacifism.[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-23){#cha-23} And so,
again, another white social worker, John R. Shillady, took over the
daily running of the NAACP. Keeping Villard at bay was always paramount,
of course, and the editor took for granted that Ovington's accession to
the chair would mean an ever freer rein on [The Crisis.]{.epub-i} But
the January issue carrying Du Bois's brief editorial, ""Thirteen,"" had
been slipped past the magazine's editorial committee. In scorching
language, it condemned the Wilson administration for hanging thirteen of
the Houston soldiers without even the formality of appeal. We raise our
clenched fists, the editor cried, ""against the hundreds of thousands of
white murderers, rapists, and scoundrels who have oppressed, killed,
ruined, robbed, and debased their black fellow men and fellow women, and
yet, today, walk scot-free, unwhipped of justice, uncondemned by
millions of their white fellow citizens, and unrebuked by the President
of the United States.""[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-24){#cha-24}
Despite her strong support for Du Bois's independence, Ovington called
Du Bois to account as strenuously as Villard and Spingarn ever had.
Reprimanded by one friend, Du Bois was celebrated by another. Joel
Spingarn was well enough that he was able to take charge of what would
become an annual major celebratory occasion---a Du Bois birthday.
Spingarn's recuperation was mentioned with gladness in [The
Crisis,]{.epub-i} ""For who can replace the few white friends who are
willing to work WITH us and not merely FOR US,"" the editor challenged.
Du Bois would turn fifty that February, and his friend intended to
orchestrate a testimonial dinner in Manhattan that would surpass Amenia
in terms of the luster of its guest list. Jessie Fauset and Georgia
Douglas Johnson, the Washington poet, were unable to participate, but
the latter contributed ""Sonnet to Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois""---""Grandly isolate
as the God of day,/Blazing an orbit through the dark and gloom/Of misty
morning, fair and far you loom...."" Herbert Croly and research scientist
Simon Flexner also sent regrets, as did William Bulkley, Horace
Bumstead, Albert Hart, and Ray Stannard Baker. Hart's regrets included
lavish praise for his old student, and Du Bois expressed pleasure in the
tribute, but added that Hart's [American Year Book]{.epub-i} ""always
says surprisingly little about the Negro in America and elsewhere."" From
Great Barrington came warm salutations from Frank Hosmer, to whom he
owed, ""more than to any single person, the fact that I got started
toward the higher training in my youth."" Sophonisba Breckinridge wished
him well with a simple, ""You have of course known for many years of my
admiration and gratitude."" Detained in Atlanta, John Hope wrote praising
his friend as a man dedicated to serving ""other people rather than
yourself."" Bessie Taylor Page, a former Atlanta University student, was
not on Spingarn's list, but, after reading about the birthday banquet,
she sent her professor a remarkable chronicle of his tenure at the
university and the apt tribute: ""It is a wonderful opportunity to be Dr.
Du Bois.""[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-25){#cha-25}

Bessie Page's words were uncannily echoed in Du Bois's after-dinner
text, ""The Shadow of Years,"" an autobiographical survey of his life. The
tuxedo was perfectly cut and the brilliance of the chandeliers accented
his bronze complexion. The distinguished and the merely important
listened as the short, balding intellectual spoke of the golden river
and the shadow of two great hills. ""The most disquieting sign of my
mounting years,"" he said, was a certain garrulity about himself, ""quite
foreign to my young days."" It was his evening, and his garrulity was
splendidly self-indulgent. He acknowledged Nina, sitting somewhat
careworn and closed but deeply proud of her Will, as he led the full
room at a gallop from the Berkshires to [The Crisis.]{.epub-i} ""[The
Crisis]{.epub-i} succeeded, and here I am on my fiftieth birthday."" A
pause for dramatic effect, and he finished. ""Last year, I looked death
in the face and found its lineaments not unkind. But it was not my
time.""[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-26){#cha-26} In the admiring
fellowship of that Saturday night, February 23, 1918, Du Bois surveyed
the struggle of his life from its summit, a high peak from which he
alone peered down and hurled thunderbolts. If there were others scaling
those heights who would soon deploy competing banners aloft, for the
present they remained insignificant specks on the face of the mountain.
Bessie Page was exactly right, being Dr. Du Bois was a ""wonderful
opportunity.""

The wonderful opportunity of being Du Bois was fully impressed upon the
White House, the American Federation of Labor, and the General Education
Board that spring. They were virtually written off in [The
Crisis,]{.epub-i} His ""The Black Man and the Unions"" was the acrid fruit
of East St. Louis and would fix Du Bois's antiunion hostility for years
to come. He had reached this personal decision ""reluctantly and in the
past have written and spoken little of the closed door of opportunity,""
but it was now absolutely clear that, under the leadership of the AFL,
there was ""absolutely no hope of justice for an American of Negro
descent.""[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-27){#cha-27} The GEB, an
old [bÃªte noire,]{.epub-i} came in for a drubbing that would become the
primer of Talented Tenth educators as they retreated and regrouped
before the juggernaut benefactions financed by the Rockefellers. Their
worst fears had begun to materialize as the interlocked philanthropies
of the GEB mounted a concerted campaign to dismantle liberal arts
instruction in African-American colleges. Long and anxiously awaited,
the 724-page definitive report of the U. S. Bureau of Education and the
Phelps-Stokes Fund on African-American higher education appeared at the
close of 1917. The death of Hollis Frissell in October of that year had
already evoked one of Du Bois's most condign verdicts yet about the
vocational education that Armstrong, Baldwin, and Ogden had foisted on
Afro-America. Frissell's death coincided with the approaching fiftieth
anniversary of Hampton's founding. An imprudent white administrator had
invited Du Bois's considered views of the institute as part of a
commemorative edition. In his ""Dear Miss Davis"" letter in the November
Crisis, Du Bois had written that little that Hampton had done or
possibly would do commended itself to the Talented Tenth. ""We have
seldom voiced this opposition,"" he admitted in concluding his lengthy
indictment, ""and I voice it now only at your
invitation.""[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-28){#cha-28}

The author of the GEB-inspired report, Thomas Jesse Jones, was a
transplanted Welshman and former Hampton Institute professor who had
become one of the ""Negro experts"" consulted by the large foundations to
the almost total exclusion of Du Bois and his circle. Even if his
two-volume [Negro Education: A Study of the Private and Higher Schools
for Colored People in the United States]{.epub-i} was not as
irresponsible, inaccurate, or negative as Du Bois asserted in a
blistering review in the February [Crisis,]{.epub-i} there is little
doubt that the report's overall impact was to lower the peaks in
African-American college and professional training and intensify its
isolation from the academic mainstream for more than a
decade.[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-29){#cha-29} The men behind
Jones's report---the mandarins of the foundations---had been
increasingly dismayed and finally exasperated by the persistent
unwillingness of many black educators and students to embrace the system
of higher education that the GEB and its affiliates deemed appropriate
to the economic and social needs of the New South. Time after time, the
foundation mandarins had believed that the Hampton-Tuskegee model of
industrial education had been broadly and lastingly implanted, only to
discover that scores of so-called universities and even tiny academies
throughout the black South were still attempting to emulate the standard
curriculum of the better white colleges and universities.

Not only had such courses somehow survived the scrutiny of white
trustees, the adamant assurances of black presidents and principals, the
formal excision from catalogues, and even the systematic discrimination
by the great foundations against uncontrite miscreants such as Atlanta,
Fisk, Lincoln, and Talladega, but there was considerable evidence that
liberal arts and physical science (literature and languages, history and
philosophy, physics and biology) were on the rebound. The former
president of Tulane University, Dr. James Dillard, a kindly Virginian
elevated to the directorship of both the Anna T. Jeanes and the John F.
Slater funds, had been flabbergasted by what he had found in 1915 at the
Ben Hill County Training School deep in rural Georgia. The enterprising
African-American principal had divided his academy into four departments
offering Greek, German, psychology, ethics, moral philosophy, economics,
and evidences of Christianity. Nor was Ben Hill County Training School
an anomaly. The GEB's Jackson Davis (he would someday prove to be one of
Du Bois's most valuable supporters) blamed the problem of creeping
higher education on the failure of administrators and faculty to resist
""the popular demand of colored people for pretentious and high sounding
courses.""[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-30){#cha-30} Instead of
wanting instruction in cooking, carpentry, tailoring, laundering, and
animal care---skills mandated by the GEB---too many African-American
students and their instructors repeatedly betrayed an incorrigible
propensity for college subjects that could lead to careers in teaching,
law, medicine, preaching, and business.

Du Bois was even more aware than the Dillards and the Joneses of the
skimpy resources and inflated courses existing in scores of such
colleges. The mandarins at the GEB could pretend to ignore [The
College-Bred Negro]{.epub-i} and [The Negro Common School]{.epub-i}
(repeated in 1910 and 1911, respectively), but the inescapable fact
remained that Du Bois's monographs were the first, and, until the Jones
study, the most comprehensive on the subject. The curriculum at the Ben
Hill School or that in place at Fort Valley High and Industrial School
(another Georgia institution) would not have astonished the
well-traveled editor. The crucial difference between the GEB officials
and Du Bois, however, was that the former saw such schools as
educational follies fully justifying the foundation's policy of
wholesale elimination from African-American higher education of valid,
grown-up arts and science courses. For Du Bois, the proliferation of
bogus colleges and anemic academies provided evidence of a people's
edifying desire to escape the dead end of being hewers of wood and
drawers of water. But the real problem, he believed, was not that there
were too many bad African-American schools but that the emergence of a
few excellent ones had been systematically impeded by white
philanthropy. Du Bois saw the sabotaging of the strongest institutions
as the underlying purpose of Jones's report.

As Jones documented with abundant data, there were too many black
institutions whose collegiate and university standards were
inferior---""only 33 of the 653 private and State schools for colored
people are teaching any subjects of college grade."" In many of the
strongest schools, the curriculum, heavy with Greek, Latin, and
philosophy, remained essentially as the first wave of earnest Yankee
preceptors had left it at the end of the nineteenth century. Jones had
in mind situations such as the one at Fisk, where fierce resistance to
reform of the curriculum had come to Du Bois's attention through a
frantic letter from the daughter of his old professor of Greek. ""All
over the South pressure has been brought to bear in favor of industrial
and vocational training,"" Mary Spence wrote. She added, barely able to
credit what she had heard, that Talladega ""does not require either Latin
or Greek for the B.A.
degree.""[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-31){#cha-31} She and her
allies intended to ""lay down our lives for the cause."" Du Bois realized
that such antiquarianism (repeatedly illustrated in Jones's report) did
the cause of higher education a disservice. Greek and Latin alone were
not the measure of the modern educated man and woman. Moreover, as he
had repeatedly written during his jousting with the Wizard, it was a
tragic error to frame the issue as a choice between either the
Hampton-Tuskegee model or the Fisk-Atlanta model. Knowing that the
""ordinary reader unacquainted with the tremendous ramifications of the
Negro problem"" would welcome the report with ""unstinted praise,"" Du Bois
bluntly stated the charge: [Negro Education]{.epub-i} was intended ""to
make the higher training of Negroes practically difficult, if not
impossible."" It was not what the report stated, but the [tone]{.epub-i}
of its argument and its ulterior purpose. Jones's report invoked the
aphorisms of Booker T. Washington in the opening pages---""It has been
necessary to demonstrate to the white man in the South that education
does not 'spoil' the Negro, as it has been so often predicted that it
would.""[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-32){#cha-32}

Du Bois fumed that it was not ""merely a silly desire to study 'Greek,'""
as Jones had repeatedly intimated, that lay behind the preference for
liberal arts at Atlanta, Fisk, Howard, and Lincoln. Rather, it was the
Talented Tenth goal of developing ""a class of thoroughly educated men
according to modern standards."" To do so, he argued, ""these Negro
colleges must be planned as far as possible according to the standards
of white colleges."" There must be no misunderstanding of the ulterior
goals behind the Jones document. [Negro Education]{.epub-i} was a master
plan to bring about the restriction and replacement of ""academic and
higher education among NegroesÂ ... by a larger insistence on manual
training, industrial education, and agricultural training;
[secondly,]{.epub-i}"" he lectured, ""the private schools in the South
must 'cooperate' with the Southern whites; and [third,]{.epub-i} there
should be more thoroughgoing unity of purpose among education boards and
foundations working among
Negroes.""[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-33){#cha-33} Du Bois knew
what few other Americans, black or white, knew (in part, because John
Hope had been present at the critical moment): that the outline of
Jones's ""scientific"" document had been largely drafted in late November
1915 at a meeting in New York attended by foundation officials for the
purpose of gaining consensus and direction in the wake of Booker
Washington's death.

Chaired by Frissell, the conference began promptly at 10:00
[A.M.]{.epub-sc} at 61 Broadway. Among the eleven white men attending
were Abraham Flexner, author of the revolutionary report (1910) on
medical and scientific education in America (Flexner had recently
ascended to a GEB secretaryship); Eban Charles Sage, distinguished
Baptist preacher and one of the GEB's most influential secretaries;
James Dillard (arriving late); Jackson Davis, one of the GEB's most
indefatigable ""circuit riders""; Wycliffe Rose, soon to head the
Rockefeller Foundation's new International Education Board; and
Jones.[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-34){#cha-34} Moton, still at
Hampton, and Hope from Morehouse were also present. Four items comprised
the agenda, but the first and fourth were paramount: GEB cooperation
with public school authorities in the South ""in developing state school
systems for Negroes adequate in extent and adjusted in content to local
needs""; and the ascertaining of ""sound policy"" appropriate as to the
""number, scope, support and development of higher academic institutions
for Negroes."" But for its grave and enduring consequences, the session
that morning at the GEB was, as Du Bois would later learn, hilarious. On
the subject of adequate preparation of public school teachers, the
principled but diplomatic Hope observed that if African-American
salaries continued to slide, fewer qualified men and women would enter
the profession. The Morehouse president touched upon the bedrock issue
of the racially discriminatory allocation of public education funds in
the South. Frissell, however, wondered if that were really a problem: ""I
am always saying to our students at Hampton that any man that goes out,
if he has industrial training and goes into the country with the amount
of land that there is, and knows about farming, that he can combine
teaching and farming in such a way as to really make a living, even with
a small salary.""[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-35){#cha-35}

Jones, the future author of the two-volume report, was enthusiastic
about the concept of a teaching cadre that would be virtually
self-financing through farming. ""Our ideals as yet, in many of these
schools, are the literary ideals,"" he explained. Farming would be
pedagogically invaluable. ""Well, that is very questionable, Doctor,""
interposed the dogged Hope. ""If a man is really going to do the teaching
that you want him to do, he won't have much time for farming."" All heads
turned to Major Moton for an opinion. ""You are right and wrong, sir,""
Moton said firmly. ""That is my opinion."" Moton, a large man, smiled
disarmingly. He went on about a man named Johns (""I was thinking, since
you have been talking, of Johns"") who had a family and wanted to teach,
but whose salary with the Pittsburgh insurance company paid him
seventy-five dollars monthly, plus commissions. ""We could not move him
at all,"" Moton explained. ""His family is staring him in the face, and it
will take two thousand dollars to equip a farm to do any farming....
That is the difficulty, sir."" Frissell was annoyed by the turn things
were taking. Hope pushed the discussion toward an unwelcome conclusion
by voicing the growing suspicion among African-Americans that the GEB
intended to sanction ""actually a different kind of education for
Negroes."" Flexner broke in to say that a different kind of education was
exactly what was appropriate. ""They do not give the colored teachers the
same examinations they give the white teachers,"" Hope countered, ""and
the question is arising whether there is to be a public school education
for white children in the South, and another for education for colored
children in the South, and I was just wondering,"" he concluded, closing
in on the essence of the meeting, ""I was just wondering whether this
'adequate in extent and adequate in content' had any reference to that
at all.""[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-36){#cha-36}

It was time for the more philosophical observations of Rose and Flexner.
Indeed it had, Flexner replied emphatically. ""It seems to me, Dr.
Frissell,"" Flexner purred, ""it is very important to distinguish between
what it is worthwhile doing for no better reason than that the white
schools are and have been doing it, and what all schools, both white and
colored, had better be doing."" ""A costly mistake had been made,"" said
he, in granting women the same educational opportunities as men. What
society had to settle for now were ""secondary schools and colleges for
women organized precisely the way the colleges for men and secondary
schools for boys were organized, with the result that we have got a very
widespread and deep seated dissatisfaction for both."" It would have been
enormously better for women, Flexner explained, to have worked out ""an
education for white girls that really met their
needs.""[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-37){#cha-37} As the
educators adjourned for lunch, it was painfully apparent to Hope---just
as it would be to Du Bois when he reviewed Jones's [Negro
Education]{.epub-i} almost three years later---that African-Americans
were not to have the benefit of ""mistakes"" made in the case of white
women.

To assail the work of the GEB, the Phelps-Stokes Fund, and the U.S.
Bureau of Education was audacious. But to predict the undermining of
European dominion over darker races and the radical redrawing of the
color line in the United States invited a federal indictment. Refusing
to be intimidated at first, Du Bois wrote in [The Crisis]{.epub-i} for
June 1918 that ""soon or late"" would come an independent China,
self-government for Egypt and India, and ""an Africa for the Africans and
not merely for business exploitation. Out of this war will rise, too, an
American Negro, with a right to vote and a right to work and a right to
live without insult."" The circulation of the magazine was approaching
eighty thousand, and those elements in the federal government
preoccupied with sedition and subversion took particular notice. There
had already been a clumsy effort at intimidation in June 1917 when
federal agents called at [The Crisis]{.epub-i} to make inquiries about
""two German girls"" rumored to work for the
editor.[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-38){#cha-38} Military
Intelligence and the Justice Department had already assembled dossiers
on the ""questionable activities"" of NAACP personnel and the inflammatory
editorial line of its monthly organ. Even Spingarn found his military
career threatened because of his involvement in the segregated
officer-training camp. Given to dramatic oratorical gestures, the
chairman had sometimes indulged in reverse psychology, agreeing with
young Talented Tenth critics that America had given them little to fight
for, in order to gain their confidence. Literal-minded to the point of
absurdity, Military Intelligence and Bureau of Investigation officers
had begun to keep careful record of Spingarn's seditious statements.

Spingarn regarded suspicions about the depth of his patriotism as an
intolerable affront, and quite probably motivated in part by
anti-Semitism. He responded by going on the offensive at the end of
April, having himself placed in the Military Intelligence Branch (MIB)
of the army. Simultaneously, he complained of pacifist dawdling at the
NAACP; in a memorandum to legal advisor Studin he charged that the
government would tolerate ""no carping and bitter utterances likely to
foment disaffection and destroy the morale of our people for the winning
of the war.""[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-39){#cha-39} As Emmett
Scott pressed his case with Newton Baker, Major Spingarn proposed the
creation of an intelligence unit to encourage and monitor
African-American participation in the war---a subsection of MI-4
(counter-espionage) for special work on ""Negro subversion."" The colonel
in command of Military Intelligence (bearing the studio-cast name of
Marlborough Churchill) was favorably disposed at first. Fully informed
of the dossiers being compiled in the Justice Department, the post
office, and Military Intelligence that could lead to suppression of [The
Crisis,]{.epub-i} Spingarn urged Scott to suggest that the U.S.
Committee on Public Information (the ""Creel Committee,"" for its
chairman, George E. Creel) arrange a Washington conference of black
editors. Spingarn sent letters to the White House pleading for the
president to express concern for improved race relations. With Moorfield
Storey's guidance and Missouri representative L. C. Dyer's pledge to
introduce it, he worked furiously on the states' rights complexities of
a bill to make lynching a federal
crime.[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-40){#cha-40}

But as he prepared to take up his assignment with Military Intelligence,
Spingarn made a decision that would come deadly close to wrecking the
career of the friend whose fifty years of intellect and courage he had
recently caused to be celebrated. That decision had all the marks of
invincible rectitude. Any pausing to consider opposing views was deemed
misguided, if not indicative of a character flaw. For that very reason,
when Joel Spingarn brought Du Bois to the capital on June 4 to urge him
to consider a captaincy in Military Intelligence, his proposal derived
from a mentality that inflated self-justification into a science. As
Joel reconstructed the exchange between them for the benefit of Amy
(""don't breathe a word of this to a human soul""), he had given Du Bois
""the shock of his life by offering him a commission."" In the quarters he
had rented near 1330 F Street, NW, the office of Military Intelligence
(""my new work is to be Jim-Crowed""), where Spingarn had already begun
recruiting African-American agents, he described in glowing terms the
work they would do together to win the war for democracy in Europe and
for civil rights in America. Given the major's growing influence in
Washington and the captain's established influence upon African-American
opinion, theirs would be an effective operation designed to speak to the
people for the government and to the government on behalf of the people.
""It will mean a great deal, not only for him and his, but for the whole
country,"" Amy read. Spingarn's elation was contagious. He had given
Colonel Churchill ""a big vision of things to be accomplished"" and Du
Bois seemed to come round, remarking after the ""shock,"" Joel told Amy,
that Spingarn ought be in the State Department rather than the War
Department.[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-41){#cha-41}

But there was no time for delay; Spingarn needed a quick answer. It is
now clear that Du Bois gave an affirmative answer before leaving
Spingarn's office, although it must have been understood that
ratification by the NAACP board would be indispensable. Without waiting
for the formalities, Spingarn assured Colonel Churchill and others in
the Justice Department that he had the editor's promise to ""change the
tone"" of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} to make it ""an organ of patriotic
propaganda hereafter."" In fact, passage of the Sedition Act that May,
containing draconian penalties for speaking, writing, or publishing
""disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language,"" had already led
the editor and the board to agree that Studin should have formal
responsibility for reviewing the magazine's copy. A visit by an agent
from the American Protective League (a citizens' organization) to a
much-rattled Dill that June further confirmed the need for extreme
caution. Spingarn's assurance, then, to intelligence officials of Du
Bois's alleged agreement could be interpreted as a response to federal
law.[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-42){#cha-42} Not only did
going to jail hold no attraction, Du Bois was as much a patriot,
according to his own lights, as any citizen.

The commission option, like the camp, should have caused Du Bois at
least a few days of introspection. He would have anticipated serious
opposition from the board on the part of Villard and GrimkÃ©, not to
mention savage recriminations from Trotter and his allies. But his quick
response to Spingarn's offer was in many ways a replay of the D.C.
assistant superintendency, not fully thought through, a radical
departure from activities that had defined him for others, and an
exercise in personal conceit. To a parochial mind, or one more
organizationally attuned, the perils of service in Military Intelligence
would have been unmistakable, but to Du Bois, for whom parochial
concerns and institutional constraints were always poorly tolerated, the
captaincy was another challenge to be turned to magnificent personal and
group advantage in defiance of the odds. Spingarn's tug on him was not
one of intellectual affinity alone but also in the nature of a debt to a
friend, a friend whose purse was available for loans, whose personal
physician stood by in sickness, and whose influence enhanced a friend's
achievements. Du Bois reached his decision before conferring with the
NAACP board or inviting the counsel of solid friends like Ovington,
Hope, or Crawford. In two full pages of single-spaced type, he declared
himself conscious of ""no inconsistency with or change of attitude"" from
his long-held conduct and opinions. ""A remarkable opportunity for
far-reaching work"" in military service beckoned, he wrote Colonel
Churchill. By the end of June, he was as intoxicated as Spingarn, whose
letters to Amy boasted of success in effecting ""an almost epoch-making
alliance of all the factions---if the thing goes through. It means that
twelve millions are unanimously mobilized in support of the country, and
the sleeping volcano may not become dangerous after
all.""[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-43){#cha-43}

Spingarn's ""epoch-making alliance"" referred to the Washington conference
of forty-one prominent African-Americans, thirty-one of whom were
publishers and editors, arranged by Scott during June 19, 20, and 21,
1918. Trotter smelled a sellout and boycotted it (holding his own
Washington meeting with Wells-Barnett and others a week later). In
addition to most of the Amenia participants, the Scott conference was
attended by Moton, GrimkÃ©, Calvin Chase, Mary Terrell, and Robert S.
Abbott of the powerful Chicago [Defender.]{.epub-i} George Creel, as
near to a minister of propaganda as anything the nation had seen before,
failed to persuade the president to address the meeting. Speaking with
Trotter in mind, Wilson told Creel that in previous encounters with him,
prominent African-Americans had ""gone away dissatisfied. I have never
had the opportunity to do what I promised them I would seek an
opportunity to do,"" he added, just as he was dodging yet another such
opportunity. Newton Baker, navy assistant secretary Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, Creel, Scott, and Spingarn gave rousing speeches, and Du Bois
drafted the conferences carefully balanced resolutions affirming that
the African-American was ""not disposed to catalogue, in this tremendous
crisis, all his complaints and disabilities."" The African-American
asked, instead, for ""that minimum of consideration which will enable him
to be an efficient fighter for
victory.""[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-44){#cha-44} None of the
forty-one participants knew then that four days earlier, Du Bois had
reported for his army physical examination. Both his age and his failure
to pass the examination were overlooked on Baker's instructions, and Du
Bois had proceeded to Scott's meeting assured of a captain's commission
(Spingarn had even suggested the probability that it might be upped to
major). As he looked back on this extraordinary chapter of his life, Du
Bois claimed that he had been spellbound by Spingarn, that ""due to his
influence"" he had come ""nearer to feeling myself a real and full
American than ever before or
since.""[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-45){#cha-45}

Real Americans are frequently past masters at making deals, and evidence
points to the fact that Du Bois struck a deal, through Spingarn, with
the War Department to use the enormous influence of his magazine toward
rallying African-Americans behind the war in return for the heady
opportunities he and Spingarn persuaded themselves their military
commissions would yield. Personal vanity and civil rights aspirations
were inextricably enmeshed, and the strategy adopted by Du Bois to win
over the public was intended to preempt, disconcert, and even cow
critics of the captaincy offer before there could be any widespread,
reasoned discussion. The deal implied cold calculation and make-or-break
audacity, and it was unworthy of Du Bois not because what he proceeded
to write could not have been honorably defended on its own terms but
because what he wrote was in large part written in order to consummate
the bargain. ""Close Ranks,"" his editorial for July 1918, was the first
installment payment on that bargain. When he recapitulated the
chronology of writing ""Close Ranks"" for the head of the Cleveland branch
of the NAACP, the editor would claim that it was not ""until June 15th
that the tentative offer of the captaincy was made"" and that this
famously controversial editorial had been written on June 6 in time for
the printer's June 10 deadline. But as Du Bois knew, the offer of the
commission had actually been proffered by Spingarn on June 4. June 15
was the date of the physical examination, and, in any case, as with the
earlier neglect of Trotter, the [Crisis]{.epub-i} printing deadline
tended to be inflexible only when it suited the editor. Little wonder,
then, that he would claim more than twenty years later that he had
difficulty ""in thinking clearly"" when trying to ""reconstruct in memory
my thoughtÂ ... during the World
War.""[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-46){#cha-46} Nor is it
surprising that the [Autobiography]{.epub-i} omits any mention of the
Military Intelligence venture.

Whatever the conflictive origins of ""Close Ranks,"" readers were
transfixed by its prose. ""This is the crisis of the world,"" Du Bois
intoned. ""For all the long years to come men will point to the year 1918
as the great Day of Decision...""

We of the colored race have no ordinary interest in the outcome. That
which the German power represents today spells death to the aspirations
of Negroes and all the darker races for equality, freedom and democracy.
Let us not hesitate. Let us, while this war lasts, forget our special
grievances and close our ranks shoulder to shoulder with our white
fellow citizens and the allied nations that are fighting for democracy.
We make no ordinary sacrifice, but we make it gladly and willingly with
our eyes lifted to the
hills.[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-47){#cha-47}

If Trotter, stunned and disgusted, found nothing more to say than that
""Close Ranks"" was a mistake, it evoked bitter reproach from Harry Smith,
Archibald GrimkÃ©, and much of the African-American press. Du Bois wrote,
almost as if flinching from the reaction, that ""the words were hardly
out of my mouth when strong criticism was rained upon it."" Niagarite
Byron Gunner wrote Du Bois pleading that ""now, 'while the war lasts,' is
the most opportune time for us to push and keep our 'special grievances'
to the fore."" Crawford grasped both sides of the issue; he agreed that
Du Bois's work with Military Intelligence ""would be a magnificent thing
for the race,"" but he worried about the fate of [The Crisis.]{.epub-i}
""The learned Dr. Du Bois has seldom packed more error into a single
sentence,"" the New York correspondent for the Pittsburgh
[Courier]{.epub-i} wrote---words less harsh than those of the editor of
the New York [News,]{.epub-i} who declared that Du Bois's actions
amounted to ""crass moral cowardice."" Randolph and Owen at [The
Messenger]{.epub-i} (""The Only Radical Negro Magazine in America"")
alternated between ridicule and regret in their response to the Crisis
editorial line. Many of those who might have favored acceptance of the
commission were incensed at the racial insult of a mere
captaincy.[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-48){#cha-48}

As [The Crisis]{.epub-i} reached its subscribers, Du Bois's July 2
circular letter to the board announced that, with the blessings of
Spingarn and Ovington, he was disposed to accept a commission in
Military Intelligence but only if the NAACP agreed to two
conditions---to his retaining control of the magazine and to his
officer's pay being supplemented in order to maintain ""my present
income."" At the meeting that same day, board members Ovington, Spingarn,
Cook, Waller, and Young supported the editor's request, but they were
adamantly opposed by the majority (""the pacifists,"" as Du Bois called
them). GrimkÃ©, backed by the sharp-tongued Neval Thomas, informed the
board that he would lead the Washington branch out of the association
unless the editor severed his connection with the magazine upon assuming
military rank. As far as Thomas was concerned, Du Bois had ""reversed his
whole life, and is no more good to us."" Joseph Loud of the Boston branch
was equally opposed, while Villard, Kelley, and others against his
retention of the magazine looked upon Du Bois's behavior as
shameful.[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-49){#cha-49} There seemed
to be no reason why James Weldon Johnson could not run [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} except that the editor objected to it.

[The Crisis]{.epub-i} continued to defend the new tack in August and
September. ""This is Our Country: We have worked for it, we have suffered
for it, we have fought for it; we have made its music, we have tinged
its ideals, its poetry, its religion, its dreams,"" the editor lectured
in ""A Philosophy in Time of War,"" a rhetorical excess that read more
like the script for [The Star of Ethiopia]{.epub-i} than an editorial.
""We are the Ancient of Days, the First of the Races and the Oldest of
Men. Before Time was, we are,"" he huffed and puffed. ""Patience, then,
without compromise."" In ""Our Special Grievances,"" readers were assured
that his July editorial had been circulated and approved by ""prominent
members and officers of the Board,"" that nothing in it was ""in the
slightest degree inconsistent"" with the battle for the ""full manhood
rights of the American Negro,"" and that the editorial echoed the
resolution unanimously adopted by the editors ""of all the leading Negro
publications in America""---at the very moment when most of the editors
were condemning him. Much had already been accomplished, he insisted;
equal rights under the draft; nearly a thousand officers trained at Camp
Des Moines; Scott as special assistant in the War Department; higher
wages and better employment; the overthrow of segregation ordinances
(unspecified); and, at long last (and due to Spingarn's desperate plea
after more than eighty lynchings had occurred that year), a public
statement from Woodrow Wilson in late July denouncing mob
violence.[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-50){#cha-50}

But, in the week following the explosion within the board, Du Bois began
to take the full measure of his Washington alliance, writing to Spingarn
about the ""incredible stupidity"" of the opposition, the undreamed of
""upheaval,"" and the ""mistaken feeling among colored people that I should
not take this work""; but he did wonder now ""how far it is my duty to fly
in the face of this opinion."" Then, too, there was the serious financial
risk, if the board forced him to choose between his editorial salary and
a captain's pay. If he were younger, of course, it would never occur to
him to hesitate, he said. Furious with the association, threatening to
leave it altogether, and even going so far as to tell Studin that he
would broadcast that ""the organization is dangerously unpatriotic and
anti-American,"" the badly unnerved Spingarn practically begged Du Bois
not to cave in and leave him to run his department alone. Spingarn could
not believe that his friend would falter. ""The opportunity to do such
work as this will never come again,"" he argued, ""and it would be
madnessÂ ... to let the opportunity slip
by.""[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-51){#cha-51} As for the
monetary risk, Major Spingarn observed that there were ready ways of
handling that. But Captain, or perhaps Major Du Bois had already begun
to retreat.

On July 12, the same day he wrote to Spingarn, Du Bois had finally
sought Hope's advice in a letter that was also designed to suggest the
offer of a Morehouse professorship after military service. Hope's reply,
a masterpiece of good sense, granted the supreme value of patriotism but
argued that African-Americans must be ""patriots [efficiently.]{.epub-i}""
He wondered whether Du Bois's most useful service lay in becoming ""a
secret service man pure and
simple?""[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-52){#cha-52} Put that way,
of course, the answer was inescapable. Spingarn soon learned from both
Studin and Shillady that Du Bois's agonizing dilemma over salary was
largely concocted. Although the board was firm in its insistence that
either GrimkÃ© or Johnson (who soon asked to be taken out of
consideration) should take over [The Crisis,]{.epub-i} both the attorney
and the executive secretary insisted that there had never been any
reservation about maintaining Du Bois's gross income at its present
level while he served his country. Even more remarkable was Studin's and
Shillady's revelation that the editor had not made ""an effective
presentation of his case at the Board meeting"" and that he had gone away
on vacation with only a vague promise to return around the first of
August. Studin was inclined to doubt that Du Bois ""really wants the
commission now in view of the storm that has been raised."" Ovington had
thought so, too, for she wrote Du Bois that he was ""probably glad"" about
the board's decision.[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-53){#cha-53}

""Fortunately the matter never came to an issue,"" Du Bois claimed in the
section of [Dusk of Dawn]{.epub-i} dealing with the captaincy. He wrote
blandly of the denouement. ""Reaction and suspicion against Spingarn
arose in the War Department."" The editor was finally left ""to work in
[The Crisis]{.epub-i} which was probably by far the best
result.""[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-54){#cha-54} But the
reality was that Du Bois had found himself in the unusual and perturbing
position of having to play a passive role until events decided for him.
On the one hand, he now saw his alliance with Spingarn as potentially
disastrous. Yet, on the other, he felt bound both by his word and the
still-strong appeal of the great national work they might yet accomplish
in Military Intelligence---to the consternation of their black and white
critics. In the whipsaw of options, Du Bois decided to escape to the
Maine backcountry, leaving Spingarn to cobble together the bureau in
Washington and to forward the paperwork approving his epaulettes.

In Washington, however, resistance to Spingarn's plan had become
formidable. Southern white officers in the MIB not only considered
themselves experts on ""Negro Subversion"" by virtue of birth, but, as
captains James L. Bruff and Harry A. Taylor's confidential memoranda to
Colonel Churchill indicated, Du Bois's presence among them would be
tantamount to the fox guarding the chicken coop. They noted that [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} was ""extremely radical and antagonistic in tone,"" and
was a major force in creating African-American unrest. As adverse
information about Du Bois was being accumulated, a similar report about
Spingarn arrived at MIB from its New York office. Major Nicholas Biddle
cited a ""recent report"" that Spingarn had told the men of Harlem's 369th
Infantry Regiment they had ""no reason"" to fight, that they were
""discriminated against."" Biddle thought it wise to remind Churchill that
Spingarn ""of course, as you know, is of Jewish race, and has often
experienced the results of race
prejudice.""[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-55){#cha-55}

Under attack by Negrophobic southern officers and possibly anti-Semitic
northern officers, Du Bois and Spingarn received the coup de grace from
Major Walter H. Loving, one of a half dozen African-Americans working
for the MIB. Loving's title came from service in the Philippines
Constabulary, where he had directed the Manila Band until an early
retirement. His intelligence activities among his own race were
indefatigable. He seemed to be everywhere, comforting the mother of one
of the hanged Houston soldiers, persuading her to ""have a quiet funeral""
for her son, seldom missing a church-basement rally of Garveyites or a
Harlem street-corner oration by Asa Randolph or the black nationalist
Hubert Harrison, or paying quiet courtesy calls to Talented Tenth
leaders. On March 5, 1918, after an interview with GrimkÃ©, Loving
reported to the MIB that he had made a friend ""of one whom we have
thought was an enemy of the government."" Nine days later, Loving noted
with satisfaction the more moderate tone of Kelly Millers speeches and
writings ""since my first interview with
him.""[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-56){#cha-56} Chicago
[Defender]{.epub-i} publisher Robert Abbott was reported to have been
similarly impressed after a visit.

Even after making allowance for his tendency to take credit for good
weather, Loving's reports were remarkable for the subtlety of their
analysis and their ultimate racial integrity, qualities which go far to
explain his later friendship with Du Bois, a friendship that was to last
until Loving's execution by the Japanese a few days before the Allied
liberation of Manila in
1945.[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-57){#cha-57} On July 22,
1918, Loving delivered to Major Biddle a lengthy, engrossing report,
""Conditions among Negroes in the United States,"" which was forwarded to
Colonel Churchill immediately. ""Close Ranks"" was ""in reality a
boomerang,"" Loving explained. Du Bois was a man of ""high intellectual
attainments who has never been popular with his people because of his
exclusive tendencies."" The captaincy controversy convinced large numbers
of African-Americans that [The Crisis]{.epub-i} had ""abandoned its stand
on the race question."" Loving concluded that the best service Du Bois
could perform now was to continue at his magazine. The captaincy
controversy would gradually die out, ""whereas his appointment to a
commission in the Army would give the radicals a continued thread for
discussion and opportunity to implicate the government in the affair.""
Eight days later, Churchill informed Spingarn that, although his ""hard
work"" was appreciated, the MIB would leave African-Americans to Bruff
and Taylor of the Military Morale Section and would concentrate on the
""morale of negro troops."" In a private letter written on August 24,
Churchill regretted the rejection of the program and expressed the hope
that Spingarn could appreciate ""how difficult for me was the situation
which made it necessary for me to withdraw my unqualified
support.""[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-58){#cha-58} But by then,
new orders had terminated Major Joel Spingarn's assignment to the MIB
and sent him to the front. Churchill had informed Du Bois of rejection
of his application for a commission in the MIB at the end of July. The
War Department had had the benefit of their excellent services without
being saddled with either NAACP man.

[WOODROW WILSON]{.epub-sc} sailed for Europe aboard the [George
Washington]{.epub-i} on December 4, 1918. The European civil war had
ground to a close on November 11, after the deaths of 21 million
civilians and combatants, in an armistice presumptively based on the
American president's Fourteen Points. Four days later, Du Bois followed
aboard the [Orizaba,]{.epub-i} the official boat for the press. He,
Moton, the newspaperman Lester Walton, and Moton's secretary Nathan Hunt
were the only African-Americans, and they shared a cabin with bath.
Walton was credentialed as a correspondent for the [Age]{.epub-i} and
Moton was on a government fact-finding mission (with Thomas Jesse Jones
serving as chaperone) to investigate the treatment of African-American
troops. Scott had had a hand in getting Du Bois on board as a member of
the fifty-two-person press delegation, although the editor's own
dramatic account of having buttonholed George Creel at dockside is
certainly not to be discounted. Already aboard were Abraham Cahan of the
[Jewish Daily Forward;]{.epub-i} Ralph Pulitzer and Herbert B. Swope of
the [World;]{.epub-i} David Lawrence of the [Evening Post;]{.epub-i}
Arthur M. Evans of the [Chicago Tribune;]{.epub-i} and Samuel S. McClure
of the McClure Newspaper
Syndicate.[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-59){#cha-59} Du Bois was
on a mission for the NAACP to serve as special representative to the
Peace Conference. The ""primary"" objective, however, was stipulated to be
the ""securing of material for the Negro history"" of the war, for which
\$2,000 had been appropriated and \$1,500 already advanced by Ovington.
In Du Bois's account of the events leading up to this fateful voyage,
the charge had fallen ""out of a clear sky"" when the board unexpectedly
asked him to assumed these two
responsibilities.[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-60){#cha-60}

But Du Bois owed his presence aboard the [Orizaba]{.epub-i} mainly to Du
Bois. The board's ratification in October 1918 of his proposal to
convene a Pan-African Congress in Paris was certainly more than a
formality, even though there was every indication that the State
Department would deny passports to any Americans wishing to attend and
the French government would refuse to act as host. But the board's
interest in a Pan-African Congress was decidedly secondary, if not
minimal, over and against the possibility of representation at
Versailles and of a firsthand, comprehensive study of the treatment of
black soldiers. Du Bois's ambitious ""Memorandum on the Future of
Africa,"" portions of which he had read at the Armistice Day meeting of
the board, resulted in a resolution to send twenty-five ""representative
Negroes"" to discuss with President Wilson the future of Africa at the
peace conference. In a letter to Wilson concerning the peace, Du Bois
implied that his accredited presence as an observer at Versailles would
gratify peoples of African descent worldwide. By the time the State
Department deigned to respond to the memorandum, inviting him to meet
with the acting secretary in January, Du Bois was in Paris. ""Only quick
and adroit work on my part"" and that of friends avoided the charade of
official consideration awaiting him in Washington. But the Pan-African
Congress still existed largely in his fecund mind.

What the NAACP board did not know, however, was that the much-described
preparation for a collaborative project to research a three-volume
history of the war also existed largely in Du Bois's mind. He would
eventually give his planned book about the war the evocative title, ""The
Wounded World."" As originally conceived, it served the dual purpose of
satisfying his desire to write a sweeping historical narrative and the
association's objective of presenting an assessment of black troop
conditions in Europe. But the ""Wounded World"" project had been badly
wounded only days after its October vote of approval, when Du Bois,
Johnson, and Scott had dined together on Sunday, November 3, to discuss
a common peacetime African-American agenda. Plans to commemorate the
tercentenary of 1619 (the arrival of African-Americans in North America)
were entirely satisfactory to Scott, as was the promotion of consumers'
cooperatives through the National Negro Business League, but when they
turned to the history of the war, collaboration faltered. Scott revealed
that he was already considering publishers' proposals. The tone of Du
Bois's memorandum to Scott five days afterward scarcely seemed
appropriate to massaging a collaboration. The NAACP war history would be
the ""complete and definitive work, done with scientific accuracy and
literary skill, and based on an exhaustive collection of facts and
documents""---what was Scott's
decision?[[61]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-61){#cha-61} In light of
the definitive November 10 reply by the War Department's special
assistant, Du Bois's subsequent memorandum to the board that, in
accordance with its vote, he had ""arranged to cooperate with Emmett
Scott on a History of the Negro in the Great War"" was puzzling. Scott
had said no, adding that his plans ""need \[not\] interfere with your
program."" Collaboration with the always-cantankerous Carter Woodson at
the Washington-based Association for the Study of Negro Life and History
was equally doomed.[[62]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-62){#cha-62}

That the NAACP board would only learn of these difficulties officially
in April 1919, after the editor's return from abroad, raises the
intriguing possibility that the Paris mission held an ulterior
importance for Du Bois. Confessing that he had been ""disposed to report
to the board that any attempt to compile a history was inadvisable,"" he
had decided, instead, to sail for France (leaving disclosure of
difficulties with the historical collaboration until later). A sheet of
stationery from Washington's Willard Hotel, bearing no date but
obviously penned shortly before Joel Spingarn left for France in
September 1918, contained a startling speculation. ""Du Bois has never
recovered from the blow to his popularity among his own people,"" he told
Amy, but the board was ""hoping that the Pan-African Congress may help
somewhat to resuscitate
him.""[[63]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-63){#cha-63} Du Bois bore a
major responsibility for the fate of some 200,000 African-American
doughboys shipped overseas. Most of them had ended up in Pershing's
""SOS"" units where they fought the war with strong backs and shovels, and
where they had been generally treated like subhumans by southern white
officers and NCOs.[[64]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-64){#cha-64}
Forty-two thousand black men had marched to the guns, though. In the
last hours of the wasting Meuse-Argonne offensive, a regiment of the
all-black 92nd Division had been thrown into the inferno for five days,
and then withdrawn in disgrace. Du Bois saw its alleged shame as a
personal affront. The battlefield performance of the four infantry
regiments comprising the rump 93rd Division (devoid of artillery,
transportation, quartermaster, or engineers) had been spectacular, yet
reports reaching the NAACP of the army high command's determination to
put the men ""in their place"" after service in French uniforms with
French divisions was further cause for Du Bois to defend those who had
closed ranks.

Whether or not Spingarn's interpretation was overdrawn, Du Bois may well
have concluded that it was advisable, book or no book, to hurry to
France whatever the pretext. Otherwise, like his nemesis Washington, he,
too, risked discredit from a bargain that the other party had found it
convenient not to honor. Behind the thunderous prose of this period a
false note of commencing doubt is just audible. A riveting dithyramb,
his armistice editorial in the December [Crisis]{.epub-i} trembled with
archaic passion, yet it seemed a measure or two over the line separating
honest exhilaration from melodrama: ""The nightmare is over. The world
awakes. The long, horrible years of dreadful night are passed. Behold
the sun! We have dreamed. Frightfully have we dreamed unimagined,
unforgettable things---all lashed with blood and tears. Bound and damned
we writhed and could not stir.... And now suddenly we are awake! It is
done. We are sane. We are alive."" Yet the grim, urgent question was to
what extent those who were awake and alive now truly believed that their
sacrifice had made sense. And did Du Bois, romantic but also skeptical
and prescient, truly believe his own edifying words? The doubt festering
behind the game prose was not yet doubt that he had been wrong ethically
to call for the closing of ranks in the war but pragmatic doubt that he
should have commended it so unequivocally (or given the appearance of
doing so) in a situation in which no possibility of intrinsic right
could exist.

Somewhat shaken, then, his certitude remained intact at its core that,
in terms of the broad picture, there was no real distinction to be drawn
between what was important to him and what was of value to those he
claimed to speak for---both a strength and a besetting flaw In that
sense, Du Bois and Woodrow Wilson were kindred intellects, both bearers
of ecumenical schemes that were visionary for the times. Leaders of
hosts they believed they had created, both ex-college professors assumed
that the multitudes could be converted to an idea through cogent,
principled explanation. Aboard the [George Washington,]{.epub-i} the
president conducted a memorable seminar in the grand salon to explicate
his Fourteen Points and League of Nations idea to the attending
scholars, technocrats, and government
servants.[[65]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-65){#cha-65} Aboard the
[Orizaba,]{.epub-i} the editor, in interviews, didactically outlined his
thirteen points promoting a ""vast state in central Africa,"" in which
""the actual government should use both colored and white officials and
later natives should be worked in."" ""I went to Paris,"" he explained in
[The Crisis,]{.epub-i} ""because today the destinies of mankind center
there. Make no mistake as to this, my
readers.""[[66]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-66){#cha-66} Du Bois's
flight to Paris in the winter of 1918--19, whatever the tangle of
motives, would achieve historic and enduring symbolism. These were days
of almost delirious innocence and expectations, it must be remembered,
with the American President touring European capitals like a messiah.
Until the Council of Ten got down to business at the Hotel Crillon in
Paris (quickly reduced to the Big Three after Italy bolted in a huff
over Balkan real estate), millions of ordinary men and women joyously
awaited the affirmation of their national aspirations, the drafting of
just and open covenants, and the securing of world peace through
international treaties upheld by a world body. Point Five of Wilson's
Fourteen Points might have been drafted by Du Bois himself: ""An
absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based on the
principle that the interests of the population must have equal weight
with the equitable claims of the government.""

One hundred thousand readers followed his and the world's destinies in a
stream of superbly narrated, often confessional, letters filling [The
Crisis.]{.epub-i} Monday morning, December 9, he docked at the military
port of Brest, and marveled at the speed with which black SOS stevedores
unloaded the [Orizaba's]{.epub-i} cargo. A sixteen-hour train ride
brought him into the Gare Montparnasse, the scene of incredible
confusion (""the worst I ever conceived of in well-ordered France"")---""no
one to collect tickets, no porters, no cabs and a surging
crowd.""[[67]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-67){#cha-67} Leaving Moton
and Walton at the station, Du Bois forged into the city with Hunt to
find a hotel. Securing a hotel together in the Rue Richelieu near the
BibliothÃ¨que Nationale, Du Bois looked up Moton, with whom he had gotten
on well, to ask Washington's successor to use his influence to expedite
his application for a military pass to visit the African-American troop
units. Then he hurried off to make arrangements to see Walter Lippmann,
one of President Wilson's principal
confidants.[[68]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-68){#cha-68} Du Bois
was counting on the fifth of Wilson's Fourteen Points to serve as the
basis for his appeal on behalf of Africa to the world leaders assembled
at Versailles. Opposition in Europe and America to the application of
the Wilsonian charter to yellow, brown, and black peoples was, as the
editor fully understood, formidable. ""Reconstruction and Africa,""
another [Crisis]{.epub-i} letter, inveighed against the ""civilized"" who
claimed to fear regression and barbarism. ""The truth is,"" he wrote
plainly, ""white men are merely juggling with words---or worse---when
they declare that the withdrawal of Europeans from Africa will plunge
that continent into chaos. What Europe, and indeed only a small group in
Europe, wants in Africa is not a field forÂ ... civilization, butÂ ...
exploitation."" And here Du Bois posited a civilizing role in Africa for
American-Africans that was intended (presumptuously, patronizingly, in
the tradition of Crummellian Ethiopianism) both to counter European
naysayers and to invest twelve struggling millions with an empowering
cultural and political mystique. ""The African movement means to us what
the Zionist movement means to the Jews,"" Du Bois proclaimed, as Garvey
would, ""the centralization of the race effort and the recognition of a
racial fount. To help bear the burden of Africa does not mean any
lessening of effort in our own problem at home.... Amelioration of the
lot of Africa tends to ameliorate the condition of colored peoples
throughout the world.""[[69]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-69){#cha-69}

If there had ever been any doubt as to why he had come to Paris, if he
himself had departed with mixed motives, now that Du Bois breathed
French air, abused the language with verve (his French would never be
more than passable), and found himself recognized in significant
circles, the scab of racist America fell away. John Hope was there,
ensconced at 12 rue d'Aguesseau in the aristocratic Faubourg St. HonorÃ©,
on YMCA business. They shared in each other's
exhilaration.[[70]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-70){#cha-70} Not long
before sailing, he had dined in Cambridge with William James and been
deeply grateful for that pleasure. That November, he had finally met
Theodore Roosevelt in person for the first time, and, notwithstanding
the former president's deplorable racial politics, Du Bois had
introduced him to a Carnegie Hall meeting with pride and
[Schadenfreude.]{.epub-i} It was Roosevelt's last public address before
dying. Yet, as Du Bois said over and again, he was convinced that ""most
Americans did not wish my personal acquaintance or contact with me
except in purely business relations, and that many of them would repay
any approach on my part with deliberate insult, while most of them would
be at least
embarrassed.""[[71]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-71){#cha-71} Europe
restored his faith in humanity, whites included. ""My God! For what am I
thankful for this night?"" he exclaimed soon after arriving. ""For
nothing. For nothing but the most commonplace of commonplaces: a table
of gentlewomen and gentlemen---soft-spoken, sweet-tempered, full of
human sympathy, who made me, a stranger, one of them."" His
African-American readers would have finished the short account with
glistening eyes, as the editor recounted laughing and bantering without
""the [Thing]{.epub-i}---the hateful, murderous, dirty [Thing]{.epub-i}
which in America we call 'Nigger-hatred.'"" ""Paris, Paris by purple
facade of the Opera, the crowd on the Boulevard des Italiens and the
great swing of the
Champs-ElysÃ©es.""[[72]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-72){#cha-72} For a
few charged weeks he lived beyond the accursed veil.

""Vive la France!"" in the March issue was another dithyramb, inspired by
the ceremony in the Trocadero organized by the Colonial League to honor
black, brown, and yellow men who had fought for the republic. ""'Mine
eyes have seen' and they were filled with tears,"" Du Bois gushed. A
black man in dress uniform, Bekhane Diop, his chest already beribboned,
had been kissed by a general as the Legion of Honor was draped across
him. ""The great audience arose, roared and cried again when the crimson
badge was pinned on an Arab who stood next to the Negro's left and the
Annamite who stood to his
right.""[[73]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-73){#cha-73} The general
who kissed and knighted these nonwhite chevaliers that Sunday night,
December 29, was none other than Louis Archinard, the architect, after
Savorgnan de Brazza, of the French empire, an icon of the expansionists
and protector of the dashing young navy and infantry officers who had
won glory for [la patrie]{.epub-i} overseas after the disastrous
Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Had Marcus Garvey witnessed the spectacle
in the Trocadero, he would hardly have been elated to see black men
honored by their colonial masters for service that had prolonged their
own subordination and exploitation. That Du Bois, author of ""The African
Roots of the War"" and impresario of Pan-Africanism, saw no irony,
paradox, and certainly no pathos, in Bekhane Diop's elevation, was a
measure of the eccentric Eurocentrism and radicalism-from-above that
still resided in the marrow of the author of [The Souls of Black
Folk.]{.epub-i} Perhaps European imperialism was ultimately
reprehensible to Du Bois less for its inequities than because, at its
Anglo-Saxon worst, it was founded on skin color. Thus, one result of the
war, ""of seemingly secondary, but really of prime importance,"" he told
readers, was that ""the American Negro should speak French"" and Spanish,
the languages of nations that Du Bois chose to deceive himself into
believing discriminated on the basis of culture rather than
color.[[74]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-74){#cha-74}

The euphoria expressed in the [Crisis]{.epub-i} letters belied the
desperate predicament of the Pan-African Congress plans. The American
secret service expected nothing to come of Du Bois's almost manic visits
to politicians, journalists, distinguished academics, aides-de-camp to
statesmen, and, finally, one or two highly placed members of Woodrow
Wilson's court. In the three weeks of scurrying about (""with the
American Secret Service at my heels""), Du Bois had failed to obtain
approval for the congress. David Lloyd George, the British prime
minister, was inaccessible and uninterested, and the French government
informed American Secretary of State Robert Lansing of Du Bois's scheme
to discuss African self-determination and of its decision to prohibit
it.[[75]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-75){#cha-75} Suddenly, there
was a breakthrough. ""Had it not been for one circumstance,"" Du Bois
wrote dramatically, ""it would have utterly failed; and that circumstance
was that black Africa had the right to send from Senegal a member to the
French Parliament.""[[76]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-76){#cha-76}
Blaise Diagne was one of seven black members of the Chamber of Deputies
and high commissioner for the Republic with special authority for French
West Africa, a title so exalted that he outranked all of France's white
servants in the colonies. Diagne was Frances ideal African
[Ã©voluÃ©,]{.epub-i} another of those colonials for whom the opening words
in French elementary school primers---[""Nos peres, les
Gaulois""]{.epub-i} (""Our Fathers, the Gauls"")---defined for a lifetime a
conception of self.

In the hour of its greatest need, when German gunners had been close
enough to site their artillery on the Eiffel Tower, Diagne raised
680,000 African soldiers for France in one year, and another 240,000 for
labor duty. Like Du Bois, Diagne had wagered on greater rights for his
people in return for fighting and dying in war. If Diagne would profess
to be satisfied in the years ahead, however, it was not because France
would have kept its pledge to the Africans of Senegal, but because
Senegal's African deputy would be so well
rewarded.[[77]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-77){#cha-77} He was also
Georges Clemenceau's trusted factotum. Through Diagne came news that the
French government would permit Du Bois to hold his conference. Although
as a young deputy Clemenceau had scoffed when the so-called M'Koko
treaties, the building blocks of France's new empire, were ratified
(with X's for signatures) by the Senate, he was in no way inclined to
promote the independence of Africans or Asians in 1919. The cynical
""Tiger"" may have wanted to tweak the nose of the self-righteous Wilson
by enabling one of the president's black American critics to obtain
publicity in the United States by upholding Wilsonian principles in
Paris. Some slight propaganda advantage in final discussions about the
distribution of former German colonies might come, Clemenceau must have
supposed, from Diagne's guarantee that the Pan-African Congress would
extol France's [mission civilisatrice]{.epub-i} overseas. Finally, the
Pan-African Congress would afford France's favorite African statesman,
Diagne, along with his fellow black deputies, an impressive, anodyne
opportunity to posture for a few days just off center-stage.

Du Bois's memorandum to Diagne spelling out the composition and purpose
of the conclave was dated January 1, three days after the high
commissioner had presided over the Trocadero ceremony. Although it makes
no mention of a vast, autonomous state in Central Africa and concedes
the former German colonies to the ""oversight of the League of Nations,""
item 4(d) called for ""development of autonomous government along lines
of native custom, with the object of inaugurating gradually an Africa
for the Africans.""[[78]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-78){#cha-78}
Clemenceau had originally stipulated February 12, 13, and 14 as the
three days authorized for the congress, but the first planning session,
which met during the first or second week in January, must have found
that time frame unrealistic. The appearance on the scene of the
enthusiastic and well-connected suffragist, Madame Calman-LÃ©vy, widow of
the prominent publisher, greatly facilitated the efforts of Du Bois and
an American female companion whose devotion and efficiency in Paris
proved indispensable. Thanks to ""this quiet, charming woman,"" their
planning and lobbying took place in one of the capital's prominent
salons. Du Bois's American companion was Ida Alexander Gibbs Hunt,
Oberlin-educated daughter of an extremely successful, Philadelphia-born
businessman who had received an appointment as U. S. Consul to
Madagascar in 1897 from McKinley. Ida Gibbs was a talented student of
languages and literature, politically informed, handsome, and may have
served as a model for Carolyn Wynn in [Quest of the Silver
Fleece.]{.epub-i} In 1904, after years of teaching in Washington's
exclusive M Street High School, she had married William Henry Hunt,
whose career as an African-American foreign service officer had begun,
like her father's, in Madagascar but who would enjoy a twenty-year span
as U.S. consul general in St. Etienne, France. She and her husband were
Du Bois loyalists and she would serve as assistant secretary to the
Pan-African Congress.[[79]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-79){#cha-79}

Relatively assured about prospects for the congress, Du Bois now
concentrated on the other half of his NAACP mandate, the military
fact-finding mission. The exact date of his departure from Paris to
visit the 92nd Division in the Marbache sector is uncertain, but it must
have been shortly after Major General F. P. Schoonmaker's January 1
alert to the division's intelligence officers that ""a man by the name of
Du Bois"" would be touring the area. His presence was to be ""immediately
reported in secret enclosure to Assistant Chief of Staff,
G-2.""[[80]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-80){#cha-80} The Army High
Command had good reason to surveil the editor because the morale of the
all-black 92nd was pitifully low and physical conditions at the camp
bordered on the outrageous, even after round-the-clock improvements just
prior to Moton's December inspection visit. Hope, who had already spent
considerable time among the African-American fighting and SOS units
throughout France, was a veritable fount of analysis and anecdote. Moton
and his party, with Du Bois sitting in, had been given a full briefing
by Hope the night before leaving for the camps. He had described the
almost total lack of recreational facilities for the troops and the
dearth of African-American YMCA officers, which the quietly furious
college president had done his best to remedy.

The army command may have been somewhat anxious about Du Bois, but it
was not prepared to court him. After leaving the 368th Infantry Regiment
near Mayenne, he was sent a remarkably detailed letter by a sergeant
contrasting his and Moton's visits. ""You were watched as if you were a
German spy. It grieved us all when we learned about it."" Du Bois had met
with tight-lipped brusqueness by white army personnel at every point. At
Domfront, their uncivil behavior was so obviously hostile that the mayor
of the village was distressed. ""The mayor apologized gravely; if he had
known of my coming, he would have received me formally at the Hotel de
Ville---me whom most of my fellow-countrymen receive at naught but back
doors, save with apology."" Instead, they sang the
[Marseillaise]{.epub-i} together in the mayor's living room. Certainly
they needed reminding, readers of the Easter [Crisis,]{.epub-i} that
African-American soldiers had helped save the world---""a little less in
the United States than elsewhere, where the actual fighting took place
and others could see our valor."" Leaving Toul on the Moselle River in
the ""deepening dark of early afternoon,"" Du Bois heard the sound of
private Tim Brimm's bugle as he came to the garrison town of Maron.
Private Brimm stood by the town pump as the sun set, blowing tunes that
Du Bois recognized from the streets of Harlem. ""Wild and sweet and
wooing leapt the strains upon the air."" Stepping out of his chauffered
auto, Du Bois found a joyful welcome in the midst of troops from
Washington, Philadelphia, Alabama, and Mississippi. He had arrived in
the sector assigned to the 92nd, whose division headquarters at Marbache
was farther along the arc of the Moselle and below the fortress city of
Metz.[[81]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-81){#cha-81}

""The Ninety-second Division went through hell,"" Du Bois found. It had
been the single black division to receive its full complement of men and
support units, but the army had distributed its units among some seven
encampments until the division was united and shipped to France in
September 1918. Many of its officers and men had been total strangers
until then. Training in the use of artillery and machine guns had been
largely ignored at Fort Dix on grounds that mastery of such weapons was
beyond the mental faculties of the men. Within weeks after
disembarkation at Brest, the division's African-American officers were
battered by a hailstorm of arbitrary transfers and courts-martial. Their
number dropped from 82 to 58 percent, and new regulations that September
gave 50 percent of the captaincies (the ceiling rank for
African-Americans) to white
officers.[[82]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-82){#cha-82} Du Bois was
never able to determine whether General Ballou, the divisions commander,
was an inveterate racist or simply incompetent---or both. In the case of
Robert Bullard, commander of the American 2nd Army, and Ballou's
superior, Du Bois documented both that general's racism and his
competency.[[83]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-83){#cha-83} When the
guns fell silent on November 11, the men of the 92nd had been strictly
confined to the muck and mire of their encampments as an alleged
precaution against the rape of French women, and more than thirty of the
remaining African-American officers were court-martialed for the
Meuse-Argonne fiasco.

If Du Bois concluded that ""American white officers fought more valiantly
against Negroes than they did against the Germans,"" it was
understandable hyperbole. There was no question in his mind about the
high command's designs. The 92nd was to be vilified. ""Everywhere an
opportunity presented itself I talked with white officers,"" Du Bois
recalled. ""In almost every instance they \[African-American soldiers\]
were referred to as cowards, rapists, or other remarks made relative to
their work which were absolutely untrue, and which were intended to
cause a bad impression."" The civil, racial, and sexual symbolism of the
black officer flew in the face of hegemony and tradition. All the more
so as the American officer corps of the time was disproportionately
recruited from white southerners. Among the trove of documents Du Bois
uncovered during his sorties from Paris to the black units, one specimen
in particular from the headquarters of the 372nd Infantry Regiment
requesting ""Replacement of Colored Officers by White Officers"" best
summarized the prevailing mentality: ""The racial distinctions which are
recognized in civilian life naturally continue to be recognized in the
military life and present a formidable barrier to the existence of that
feeling of comradeship which is essential to mutual confidence and
[esprit de
corps.]{.epub-i}""[[84]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-84){#cha-84}

An endangered species, black officers were vanishing by the week, and by
the time Du Bois crisscrossed the silent war front from the Marne to the
Vosges, they were almost totally gone from the three National Guard New
York 15th, the ""Harlem Hellfighters"" (called up as the 369th Infantry
Regiment), one of the first fighting units to reach France, had been
stripped of all but one or two African-American officers after giving a
good account of itself in the Second Battle of the Marne---""except the
bandmaster and the chaplain,"" wrote Du Bois in the first draft of his
history.[[85]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-85){#cha-85} Du Bois took
no comfort in the fact that the 369th's bandmaster, Lieutenant James
Reese, was the musician who introduced jazz to Europe. The ""famous 8th
Illinois,"" as the editor saluted it (federalized as the 370th), had
sailed with only African-Americans leading it. The commander, cocky
Colonel Franklin A. Dennison, had marched his men back to Newport News,
Virginia, where they were given unsegregated quarters aboard ship.
Dennison, the last remaining officer of field rank, was eventually
mysteriously repatriated, but most of the other African-American
officers survived under the bitterly resented leadership of their new
white colonel.[[86]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-86){#cha-86}
Brigaded with the French 59th Division, the 370th had swept up Mont
Dessinges in September 1918 and then into the charnel house at Grand
Lup.

The materials Du Bois gathered would be published as ""Documents of the
War"" in [The Crisis]{.epub-i} for May 1919. Postmaster Burleson's shock
would result in a one-day delay before the government decided against
suppressing the issue. ""The following documents have come into the hands
of the editor. He had absolute proof of their authenticity,"" Du Bois
would crow. The secret communiquÃ© from the French Military Mission
stationed with the American army was a bombshell. Until its suppression
by the appropriate French ministries, the infamous ""Secret Information
Concerning Black American Troops,"" had been circulated, at the request
of the American high command, to French military units as well as to
prefects and sub-prefects of the [dÃ©partements.]{.epub-i} French
attitudes toward people of color were a menace to the American social
order, readers of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} learned along with much of the
rest of the country. ""As this danger does not exist for the French race,
the French public has become accustomed to treating the Negro with
familiarity and indulgence."" The document announced that this must end,
as such indulgence and familiarity were matters of ""grievous concern to
the Americans. They consider them an affront to their national policy.
They are afraid that contact with the French will inspire in black
Americans aspirations which to them \[the whites\] appear
intolerable.""[[87]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-87){#cha-87}

There would be much more. An inflammatory letter to a U. S. senator from
the white chief of staff of the 92nd denigrated the men and officers,
alleged ""about thirty cases of rape,"" and described the lamentable
engagement in the Meuse-Argonne after September 26 as one in which ""they
failed in all their missions, laid down and sneaked to the rear, until
they were withdrawn.""[[88]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-88){#cha-88}
Du Bois found, as Moton had, that there had been five convictions for
attempted rape and one execution for rape (photographed by the
division's white photographer, who two hours later skipped a Croix de
Guerre ceremony for two black officers). As for the controversial
disgrace of the 368th Infantry Regiment (for which the entire 92nd
division had been stigmatized), the complicated story that ultimately
emerged would largely confirm Du Bois's charge that a disaster had been
engineered to prove a calumny. Already demoralized by its white officers
(""dumping ground for white officers,"" an NCO informant told Du Bois),
the regiment was ordered over the top without maps, grenade launchers,
heavy-duty wirecutters, or signal flares. Its artillery had been loaned
to another division. One white battalion commander remained in the rear
during the entire five-day engagement. Another, a New York lawyer,
ordered his machine gunners to retreat. General Pershing's original
orders had been to use the 92nd as a reserve and to fill the space
between the French 37th Division on its left and the American 77th
Division. In the preliminary draft for ""The Wounded World,"" Du Bois
would sum up the perfidy of the army high command in four terse
sentences: ""First, was the effort to get rid of Negro officers; second,
the effort to discredit Negro soldiers; third, the effort to spread race
prejudice in France; and fourth, the effort to keep Negroes out of the
Regular Army.""[[89]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-89){#cha-89}

The wonder was that there were four African-American units that had
performed outstandingly---the 369th, 370th, 371st, and 372nd of the
never-completed 93rd Division. These were the infantry regiments that
Pershing had rushed to fight alongside the French. In addition to the
American high command's promise to lend a number of units to the French
while the American Expeditionary Army was being assembled, the racial
friction in towns near the camps of these units had led Scott to urge
their relocation. Two months after Houston, the men of the 369th had
come within minutes of shooting up Spartanburg, South Carolina, after
Private Noble Sissle's cap had been slapped off in a hotel lobby. The
former New York National Guard regiment, the sole unit permitted to fly
its state flag, arrived in Brest in December 1917, among the first
American fighting units in France. Desperate for manpower, the French
high command pounced on the unit. Its uniforms, weapons, and order of
march became French. The 369th had spent 191 days under continuous fire,
the longest stretch of any American unit. Sergeant Henry Johnson and
Private Needham Roberts had won the first Croix de Guerre awarded to
Americans, after capturing a German patrol. The regiment's combat
performance at ChÃ¢teau-Thierry, Belleau Wood, and Cantigny earned it the
singular honor of leading the advance of the French army into
German-occupied territory after the
Armistice.[[90]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-90){#cha-90} They would
be absent along with the other African-American units when the great
allied victory parade streamed down the Champs-ElysÃ©e in late summer.
The 372nd, composed of National Guard battalions from Ohio,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia, had
managed to hold on to many of its officers, while the 371st (a regiment
composed of South Carolina draftees) had never seen a black
officer.[[91]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-91){#cha-91}

Since Robert Moton had scrupulously avoided investigating the full depth
and extent of racial discrimination against African-American military
personnel, Du Bois concluded that his mission had been a fraud, a harsh
judgment he would share with his readers in the famous May issue. Moton
knew the appalling neglect and the intentional hardships visited on the
troops by government officials and a collusive YMCA. In Brest, 40,000
men awaited transportation home with only one African-American YMCA
officer to handle their needs. ""Sometimes, even when there were no
signs, services to colored soldiers would be refused,"" Addie Hunton and
Kathryn Johnson, two women serving overseas with the ""Y,"" revealed. They
reported incidents of soldiers wounded in the Argonne offensive who had
languished three days before they received ""attention of either a doctor
or a nurse."" The catalogue of insult and cruelty was a long one. ""What
did Dr. Moton do?"" Du Bois asked of the Tuskegee principal. ""He rushed
around as fast as possible. He took with him and had at his elbow every
moment that evil genius of the Negro race, Thomas Jesse Jones, a white
man. Dr. Moton took no time to investigate or inquire. He made a few
speeches, of which one is reported by a hearer as follows."" The text of
the Moton address before an assembly of African-American officers was
ceremonious and cagey in the best tradition of the
Wizard.[[92]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-92){#cha-92} Two months
later, in ""Our Success and Failure,"" Emmett Scott's turn would come.
""For four long months story after story and document after document
poured into the editor's hands substantiating the above charges"" about
the policies of the High Command, said Du Bois in announcing the results
of his trip to the front. How was it, he demanded to know, that the
single most informed black official, the person strategically placed in
the executive branch of government, had been able to accomplish so
little to protect the rights of 200,000 of the ""best blood of our young
manhood?"" They had been ""crucified, insulted, degraded and maltreated,
while their fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers had no adequate
knowledge of the real truth.""

The editor conceded that Scott alone could not have improved racial
policies that had behind them the full force of tradition, party
politics, and institutional prerogative. But it was not ""simply a
question of what Mr. Scott personally could or could not
accomplish---God knows we are all of us helpless enough in this bitter
fight."" Du Bois thundered that Scott's conduct raised ""the vaster
question of the right of concealing fatal knowledge.... If Mr. Scott did
not know, why did he not find out? If he did know, what did he do about
it?""[[93]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-93){#cha-93} The attack on
Scott would unleash a furious controversy in the black press, with
significant segments of the NAACP membership siding with Booker T.
Washington's former secretary against what was seen as the editor's
pitiless, unfair reproach. While the debate raged, Scott's well-written,
informative, cautious [Official History of the American Negro in the
World War]{.epub-i} appeared, with a preface by Newton Baker and
endorsements from Theodore Roosevelt and General
Pershing.[[94]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-94){#cha-94}

On Wednesday afternoon, February 19, Blaise Diagne delivered the opening
address to the three-day Pan-African Congress at the Grand Hotel in the
boulevard des Capucines. It was a paean to French colonialism and to the
privileges subject peoples slowly evolving under its tutelage were said
to enjoy. As president of the congress the distinguished Senegalese
Frenchman expressed the hope that the ideal of racial unity ""would
inspire all of African descent throughout the entire world."" The
Pan-African Congress was more ""pan"" than African, with only a handful of
the fifty-eight delegates from sixteen nations, protectorates, and
colonial entities able to claim any firsthand knowledge of the
continent. Like the secretary of the congress himself, Du Bois, none of
the sixteen delegates from the United States had yet visited sub-Saharan
Africa. The next-largest delegation consisted of thirteen persons from
the French West Indies. Seven were from Haiti, and an equal number, like
the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Chamber of
Deputies, were from France. Algeria, the Belgian-ruled Congo, the
Spanish and Portuguese colonies, Ethiopia, and Egypt provided one
delegate each. A single delegate was listed as representing the entirety
of British Africa, Lloyd George's government obviously having had no
interest in seeing its subjects participate in such a proceeding. The
""colored"" ex-mayor of Battersea, London, was the sole exception to a
British ban on passports issued to attend the congress. Even the
secretary of the venerable Aborigines Protection Society was
refused.[[95]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-95){#cha-95} That the
Pan-African Congress numbered almost sixty persons was largely due to
Madame Calman-LÃ©vy's salon and to the ingenious publicity campaign and
coordination efforts devised by Du Bois and the tireless Ida Hunt at the
Hotel de Malte in the rue Richelieu. The Hotel de Malte served as a
center of attraction for a surprisingly large number of
African-Americans in the French capital, most of whom were recruited to
serve as delegates. African-Americans who had applied to the State
Department for passports to attend the congress had been immediately
refused.[[96]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-96){#cha-96}

As he and Hunt pressed their cause, Du Bois was seized by the same
visionary enthusiasm that he had experienced in London nineteen years
before. He imagined the immediate creation of a far more effective
Pan-African Movement capable of maintaining ""a central headquarters with
experts, clerks and helpers"" (instead of a single room in a small hotel)
while the deliberations of the Versailles Peace ran their course. Paris
was the cockpit of Europe, the refuge of the ""little groups who want to
be nations,"" said Du Bois, ""like the Letts and Finns, the Armenians and
Jugo-Slavs, Irish and Ukrainians. Not only groups, but races have
come---Jews, Indians, Arabs and All-Asia."" His readers must realize that
""the destinies of mankind for a hundred years to come"" were being
settled in a small room of the Hotel Crillon by four ""unobtrusive
gentlemen who glance out speculatively now and then to Cleopatra's
Needle on the Place de la Concorde."" If ""unobtrusive"" and ""speculative""
were increasingly inappropriate descriptions of the Council of Four
(Woodrow Wilson, Lloyd George, Clemenceau, and, for the moment, Orlando
of Italy), Du Bois was entirely right regarding its impact on millions
of destinies. He had come to defend the destiny of a great number of
millions---""to help represent the Negro world in Africa and America and
the Islands of the Sea."" And he had done so for \$750, the cost of the
Pan-African Congress, he said. He had done what he had to do and done it
well, yet, in the immediate, heady aftermath of the Paris conclave, he
speculated grandly that if the Negroes of the world had provided the
money and personnel, ""they could have settled the future of Africa at a
cost of less than
\$10,000.""[[97]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-97){#cha-97}

Then, upon reflection, Du Bois decided that the results of the first
(really the second) Pan-African Congress ""were small. But it had some
influence.""[[98]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-98){#cha-98} The three
days of speeches at the Grand Hotel exude a time-bound quaintness now.
Monsieur Van Overgergh of the Belgian Peace Commission spoke of
promising reforms that were under way in the Congo, and the Portuguese
former minister of foreign affairs, Freire d'Andrade, cited progress in
Africa's oldest European empire. The Francophone Africans were
predictably rhapsodic about progress under the Third Republic. If the
Liberian delegate had less to point to, he too was confident of the
future advancement of his country and of Africans worldwide. The
Americans sounded the full keyboard---from Charles Russell's celebration
of the end of world racism and the historic significance of the congress
through William Walling's appeal to the U.S. Congress that its body
reflect the diversity of races in the manner of the French Chamber of
Deputies, to George Jackson's personal expression of shame for the
discrimination his people suffered in their own land. Addie W. Hunton
eloquently reminded the overwhelmingly male assembly of the global role
women would play to secure democracy. Hunton's words were amplified in
the final session when Madame Jules Siegried, president of the French
National Association for the Rights of Women, brought greetings from her
organization. Du Bois quoted her as saying that no one could appreciate
better than women ""the struggle for broader rights and
liberties.""[[99]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-99){#cha-99} John Hope
and Joel Spingarn in his officers' uniform were in the audience but did
not speak from the platform. Villard, who was also in Europe at the
time, ignored these Pan-African activities completely.

Diagne gaveled the meeting to a close on Friday evening, the
twenty-first. The resolutions of the Pan-African Congress were to be
presented to the Peace Conference for action. They called for direct
League of Nations supervision of the former German colonies. In the days
following the Pan-African Congress, Du Bois was finally able to meet
with members of the Wilson inner circle. Walter Lippmann, one of the
president's most valued advisors at Versailles, had written him just
before the proceedings adjourned to say that he was ""very much
interested"" in the congress. He invited Du Bois to send along ""whatever
reports you may have on the work""---which Du Bois promptly did. Joel
Spingarn used his influence in order to arrange for Du Bois to meet
George Louis Beer, the chief American advisor on colonial matters at the
Peace Conference. Du Bois would claim a few years afterward that the
idea for the Versailles administration of colonial territories---the
Mandates Commission---had sprung from this interview. If so, however,
the system of mandates was alien to the concept originally envisaged by
him and most of the congress delegates, for it really only amounted to a
fiction by which the United Kingdom and France were given the German
territories as de facto
colonies.[[100]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-100){#cha-100} The
resolution calling for the drafting of a code of law ""for the
international protection of the natives of Africa"" was another idea
implemented largely on paper. The fine pen of congress secretary Du Bois
was evident in this as in most of the other resolutions. Another
Pan-African Congress was proposed for 1920, as well as the creation of
an international quarterly to be called [Black Review]{.epub-i} and
published in several
languages.[[101]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-101){#cha-101}

Publicity for the congress delighted Du Bois, a payoff for the cordial
attention he had uncharacteristically paid to white journalists aboard
the [Orizaba.]{.epub-i} The New York [Evening Globe]{.epub-i} gave the
event considerable play on February 22, breathlessly describing the
opening session with black people ""seated at long green tablesÂ ... in
the trim uniform of American Army officers, other American colored men
in frock coats or business suits, polished French Negroes who hold
public office, Senegalese who sit in the French Chamber of Deputies...""
Two days later, a dispatch in the New York [Herald]{.epub-i} advised
readers that there was ""nothing unreasonable in the programme."" The
correspondent for the [Chicago Tribune]{.epub-i} realistically noted
that the memorandum Du Bois had drafted for Wilson's contemplation was
""quite Utopian, and has less than a Chinaman's chance of getting
anywhere at the Peace Conference, but it is nevertheless
interesting.""[[102]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-102){#cha-102} The
French press was considerably more solicitous, tracking Du Bois's
appearances before the League of the Rights of Man (the powerful civil
liberties organization that had defended Dreyfus) to his audience with
dignitaries having some connection to the peace conference.

The attention paid by the Paris press and the courtesies extended by
Clemenceau and distinguished organizations made it unavoidable for
Colonel Edward M. House, Wilson's unusually urbane alter ego from Texas,
to meet with Du Bois. The colonel was fascinated by the congress, proved
extremely helpful in arranging other appointments for Du Bois, but kept
his counsel about the fate of the Pan-African Congress resolutions.
Interestingly (and mischieveously), House confided to Du Bois that upon
seeing Moton he had urged the latter to stay in Paris in order to
""appear in person before the Peace Conference"" to represent the Negro
world. Moton, however, had chosen to return to Tuskegee, standing up
Lloyd George.[[103]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-103){#cha-103}
(House neglected to extend the same courtesy to Du Bois, though.) For
the first time since the Berlin Conference on West Africa and the
""scramble"" unleashed by it, the principles of self-determination and the
fundamental rights and liberties to which subject African peoples were
entitled had been articulated by accomplished men and women who
purported to speak for Du Bois's darker millions. While their immediate
and practical consequences would be negligible, a powerful idea to bind
up the wounds of the world had been launched in Paris.

Du Bois returned to the United States and his magazine (edited in his
absence by Fauset) on April 1, 1919, just in time to write his
second-most-famous editorial---one that would go a long way toward
redeeming the perceived imprudence of ""Close Ranks."" ""Returning
Soldiers"" appeared in the May issue, which Postmaster Burleson had
wanted to suppress and which would sell 106,000 copies:

We are returning from war! [The Crisis]{.epub-i} and tens of thousands
of blackmen were drafted into a great struggle. For bleeding France and
what she means and has meant and will mean to us and humanity and
against the threat of German race arrogance....

This is the country to which we Soldiers of Democracy return. This is
the fatherland for which we fought! But it is [our]{.epub-i} fatherland.
It was right for us to fight again. The faults of [our]{.epub-i} country
are [our]{.epub-i} faults. Under similar circumstances, we would fight
again. But by the God of heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if now
that the war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and
brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the
forces of hell in our own land.

We return.

We return from fighting.

We return fighting.

Make way for Democracy! We saved it in France, and by the Great Jehovah,
we will save it in the United States of America, or know the reason
why.[[104]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-104){#cha-104}

Yet ""the problem of the twentieth century,"" as Du Bois himself had
presciently told the delegates to the 1900 Pan-African Congress in
London, ""is the problem of the color line."" And race would remain the
basis for denying ""to over half of the world the right of sharing to
their utmost ability the opportunities and privileges of modern
civilization."" Moorfield Storey saw clearly that racial backlash was the
reason why democracy was in danger of being swept aside. Anticipating
the heightened sense of pride that tens of thousands of them would feel
when the war ended, he knew that ""Negroes will come back feeling like
men and not disposed to accept the treatment to which they have been
subjected.""[[105]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-105){#cha-105} The
tribal and institutional power of those ""forces of hell in our own
land,"" editorially challenged by Du Bois, were starkly manifested in the
lynching of seventy-eight African-Americans during 1918 and in the
boasts of white newspapers in the South about the bloody fate in store
for any black man daring to come back from the war expecting to be
treated like a white man. Less than six weeks after he returned to his
desk at [The Crisis,]{.epub-i} the Saturday-night murder of a black
civilian by a white sailor in Charleston, South Carolina, marked the
first incident in what became a tidal wave of homicides, arson, mayhem,
and organized racial combat sweeping up from the Deep South and
Longview, Texas, into Washington, D.C., across the country to Chicago,
and, dipping down to Knoxville, Tennessee, rolling on finally over
Omaha, Nebraska.

In the outburst of editorials during this ""Red Summer"" of 1919, the
[Whip,]{.epub-i} a militant black Chicago weekly, put the national
atrocity in best perspective: ""\[The rioters\] really fear that the
Negro is breaking his shell and beginning to bask in the sunlight of
real manhood."" Unmistakably, a new manhood---and, as Du Bois above all
underscored, a new womanhood---was asserting itself. The ""New Negro"" was
virtually an overnight discovery. ""We would be less than men, then,""
[The Crisis]{.epub-i} insisted, ""if our experience in the war had not
left us quickened and fired, rubbing our eyes and asking in clearer and
clearer accents 'Where do we come
in?'""[[106]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-106){#cha-106} Yet even Du
Bois found his editorial antennae twisting wildly from the extraordinary
national unrest and violence in the wake of the Great War. Race riots on
a national scale, the flight out of the South of hundreds of thousands
of African-Americans, the explosion of labor strikes from coast to coast
shutting down shipyards, coal mines, steel works, and even the Boston
police force, and the panic among the propertied classes inspired by the
Bolshevik revolution in Russia---each of these developments,
individually and in combination, made race relations far worse than they
already were. Sixteen years after the publication of [The Souls of Black
Folk,]{.epub-i} the virtual exclusion of his people from meaningful
citizenship in American society gave few signs, if any at all, of
diminishing. ""One ever feels his two-ness---an American, a Negro,"" Du
Bois had written there, proclaiming another great twentieth-century
truth.[[107]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-107){#cha-107} He was
stunned and deeply saddened by this upsurge of racial hostility, but it
was not in Du Bois's nature to be either intimidated or demoralized.
There could be no turning back now from the fight for full civil rights
he and some thirty others had begun on the Canadian side of Niagara
Falls in the summer of 1905. ""Brothers we are on the Great Deep,"" he
wrote in [The Crisis]{.epub-i} as the barbaric summer ended. ""We have
cast off on the vast voyage which will lead to Freedom or
Death.""[[108]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter19-108){#cha-108}

T[HE]{.epub-sc} P[ERPETUAL]{.epub-sc} D[ILEMMA]{.epub-sc}

B[OOKER]{.epub-sc} T. W[ASHINGTON'S]{.epub-sc} obituary in the December
1915 [Crisis]{.epub-i} was neither too long nor too short. Villard had
feared that Du Bois would make it disgracefully brief, something like
""'B. T. Washington, the well-known educator, died at Tuskegee last
week'---his usual style,"" he predicted to Spingarn. The Great
Accommodator's end had been an anticlimax, the final punctuation mark to
a career long in decline. Stricken in New York, he had overridden the
advice of the physicians at St. Luke's Hospital and boarded the Pullman
for Tuskegee. An incurable disease bearing the earmarks of syphilis had
reached its terminal phase. His body ruined by kidney failure and high
blood pressure, Washington was quoted by the press as saying ""I was born
in the South, I have lived and labored in the South, and I expect to die
and be buried in the South."" His wishes were fulfilled when, two days
after his death on November 4, a vast crowd of mourners accompanied his
remains to a small plot of ground next to the institute's chapel. Near
the grave would rise, eight years later, a bronze monument nearly ten
feet tall. It depicted a heroic Booker T. Washington lifting a veil
symbolizing ignorance from a crouching figure, an emancipated slave,
although detractors among the Talented Tenth would insist that the veil
was actually being
lowered.[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-1){#cha-1}

Du Bois's farewell to his nemesis was both stately and judgmental.
Washington's death marked ""an epoch in the history of America."" He was
the ""greatest Negro leader since Frederick Douglass, and the most
distinguished man, white or black,"" to emerge from the South since the
Civil War. There was much to thank him for, Du Bois noted---Tuskegee,
the ideal of interracial cooperation in the South, the encouragement of
thrift and business among African-Americans, the acquisition of land.
""Stern justice"" commanded, however, that ""we must lay on the soul of
this man a heavy responsibility for the consummation of Negro
disfranchisement, the decline of the Negro college and public school and
the firmer establishment of color caste in this land."" But what was done
was done. ""This is no fit time for recrimination or complaint. Gravely
and with bowed head let us receive what this great figure gave of good,
silently rejecting all
else.""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-2){#cha-2} Villard probably
thought it a good thing, after all, that the obituary was no longer than
it was. The personal combat with Washington was over, but the
competition by the two belief-systems for minds and hearts engendered by
that combat now entered another phase, one in which all points of
reference, every undertaking (economic, educational, political), and
even the most casual relationships, were to be subordinated to the
Manichean social and civil values of what succeeding generations of
African-Americans called the Du Bois--Washington controversy. And as
intensely personal and egocentrically articulated as it had been, the
controversy was really not about Du Bois and Washington in an ultimate
sense, and would have emerged inevitably in one form or another.
Essentially, the Talented Tenth and the Tuskegee Machine were responses
by two African-American leadership groups to white supremacy as it
existed in two regions of the United States. In that sense, Washington's
impoverished, agrarian South, with its monocrop economy and biracial
demographics, was no fit arena for the high-minded cultural and exigent
civil agenda of the people for whom Du Bois spoke. Conversely, the
lowest-common-denominator realities and patient abnegation embraced by
Washington was no program for racial advancement in the urban,
industrial, multiethnic North. Du Bois and Washington, in speaking for
two dissimilar socioeconomic orders, were really speaking past each
other rather than to the same set of racial problems and solutions; but
Du Bois, for all his Victorian sensibilities and elitism, had the
advantage of speaking to the future, while Washington, business-oriented
and folksy, spoke, nevertheless, for the early industrial past.

Washington's death, as Du Bois rightly gauged, coincided with the
beginning of a new epoch in African-American history and in American
race relations. Robert Russa Moton was about to assume the helm at
Tuskegee, and the editor promised him the ""sympathy and good will of his
many friends both black and white."" Sympathy and goodwill would still be
intact in July 1916 when [The Crisis]{.epub-i} published its editor's
""Open Letter to Robert Russa Moton."" Disturbing news reports that Moton
had begun to parrot the bromides of his predecessor about segregated
transportation were dismissed for the moment. Moton's well-wishers hoped
for and expected patent proof that Tuskegee believed ""in the right to
vote,"" Du Bois stressed, ""that it does not believe in Jim-Crow cars,
that it recognizes the work of the Negro colleges, and that it agrees
with Charles Sumner that 'Equality of rights is the first of
rights.'""[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-3){#cha-3} Reconciliation
between radical and conservative forces in Afro-America was overdue, and
even seemed feasible now that the affable, better-educated Moton was
leader of the Bookerites. The Amenia Conference, which was to bring the
several civil rights elements together that summer, would have been an
unrealistic project otherwise.

There was a new epoch in world history, as well. Most Americans believed
that the country could stay out of the war in Europe. President Wilson
promised to keep the United States neutral. Pacifism was a considerable
force in Congress and in the cabinet, with Secretary of State Bryan as
deeply opposed to involvement as Ovington and Villard were at NAACP
headquarters. Neither an isolationist nor a philosophical pacifist, Du
Bois was far less committed to the belief that the American fire wall
could withstand the conflagration in Europe. His student class at the
University of Berlin was fast approaching fifty, not too old to fight
but old enough not to have to. Many of them, he knew, were in field grey
officers' tunics on the eastern front or in the trenches in France. From
England, Nina wrote that the male teachers at Bedales were leaving for
the front. Du Bois experienced the civil war among Europeans, then, with
a trenchancy many Americans could not have shared. His admiration for
European nations---for the kaiser's Germany, Edward VII's empire,
Clemenceau's France---was both deeply held and yet conditional, an
ambivalence conveyed by ""Of the Children of Peace,"" a vivid reflection
in the children's number of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} for October 1914 on
his Berlin student days as spectator to martial pageantry: ""The King
bowed to the Emperor and the Emperor bowed to the King, and there rose a
great cry of pride and joy and battle from the people. With that cry I
seemed suddenly to awake. I somehow saw [through;]{.epub-i} (you know
sometimes how you seem to see, but are blind until something happens and
you really see?)."" He felt both sadness and satisfaction at the carnage.
""Civilization has met its Waterloo,"" he solemnly declared in [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} after the sinking of the [Lusitania.]{.epub-i}
""Brothers, the war has shown us the cruelty of the civilization of the
West. History has taught us the futility of the civilization of the
East.""[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-4){#cha-4}

""The African Roots of the War,"" appearing in the May issue of the
[Atlantic Monthly,]{.epub-i} was one of the analytical triumphs of the
early twentieth century. Du Bois poured into it his mature ideas about
capitalism, class, and race, anticipating by two years Lenin's
[Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capitalism.]{.epub-i} The essay
opened with a novel proposition---that, ""in a very real sense,"" Africa
was the prime cause of the World War. Using a quotation from Pliny as
his text---[""Semper novi quid ex Africa""]{.epub-i} (""Africa is always
producing something new"")---Du Bois passed in kaleidoscopic review the
ravages of African history from earliest times to the European
Renaissance, Stanley's two-year charge from the source of the Congo
River to its mouth in 1879, the partition five years later of the
continent at the Berlin Conference, and the miasma of Christianity and
commerce suffocating indigenous cultures and kingdoms. European hegemony
based on technological superiority had produced the ""color line,"" which
became ""in the world's thought synonymous with inferiority.... Africa
was another name for bestiality and barbarism."" The color line paid huge
dividends, and Du Bois described the ""lying treaties, rivers of rum,
murder, assassination, rape and torture"" excused in the name of racial
superiority with his staple power and imagery. The Scramble for Africa,
in which England was speediest, humiliated the French, encouraged the
Belgians, belatedly aroused the Germans, and irrationally involved the
Italians. ""The African Roots of the War"" enumerated the flashpoints that
might have ignited an earlier European firestorm: ""France and England at
Fashoda, Italy at Adua, Italy and Turkey in Tripoli, England and
Portugal at Delagoa Bay, England, Germany, and the Dutch in South
Africa, France and Spain in Morocco, Germany and France in Agadir, and
the world at Algeciras.""[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-5){#cha-5}

The creation by finance capital of mutually exclusive economic spheres
lay behind the accelerating crises. But what of the progressive forces
ostensibly opposing and retarding exploitation---parliamentary
democracy, socialist parties, trade unions? Borrowing insights from John
Hobson's 1902 book, [Imperialism,]{.epub-i} source text for much of the
twentieth century's neo-Marxism, Du Bois disclosed one of the great
paradoxes of triumphant democracy: ""The white workingman has been asked
to share the spoil of exploiting 'chinks and niggers.'"" It was no longer
merchants, bankers, and industrialists monopolizing the spoliation of
the planet, ""it is the nation, a new democratic nation composed of
united capital and labor."" Even though labor's percentage of the gross
was still minimal, its ""equity is recognized."" This was the real secret,
he contended, of that ""desperate struggle for Africa which began with
Stanley in 1877 and is now culminating."" The gravamen of his analysis
anticipated the thesis Lenin was soon to propound to explain the failure
of capitalism to succumb to the consequences of overproduction and class
conflict. The white working class had been appeased by state welfare
concessions, on the one hand, and, on the other, cowed by capital with
threats of ""competition by colored labor."" ""By threatening to send
English capital to China and Mexico, by threatening to hire Negro
laborers in America, as well as by old-age pensions and accident
insurance, we gain industrial peace at home at the mightier cost of war
abroad."" But the globalizing economic exploitation only delayed the
unavoidable holocaust of spreading European fratricide. In time, the
planet's majority colored population would be able to take advantage of
European disunity, ""and the War of the Color Line will outdo in savage
inhumanity any war this world has yet seen,"" Du Bois prophesied. That
racial GÃ¶tter-dÃ¤mmerung could be avoided only if ""European civilization""
extended the ""democratic ideal to the yellow, brown, and black
peoples.""[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-6){#cha-6}

When John Hope finished reading ""The African Roots of the War"" aloud to
his dinner guests on campus, one of them remarked that Du Bois was a
great man because of his exceptional advantages. Hope wrote his friend
that he had replied, ""You are able because you are honest."" That the
editor was the ablest public personality in black America would have
been contested only by diehard Bookerites. Babies were named after him,
social organizations founded in his honor, civil rights risks taken
because of his exhortations. From Kentucky came a request from the
Garrett Distributing Company to name a brand of cigar after him and
place his photograph ""on our box labels and cigar brands."" Du Bois
replied that he was agreeable, ""if the cigar is not too bad."" The
daughter of one avid [Crisis]{.epub-i} reader reported that her expiring
father's last wish had been to read the December 1915 issue, but that he
had died the day before it arrived. ""So we placed it in his coffin,""
wrote Dorothy Pohle of her parent's devotion to the
magazine.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-7){#cha-7} Du Bois paid
the Pohle family the high compliment of a year's free subscription. A
young Jamaican who had met Du Bois briefly during his visit to the
island the previous year could imagine no more auspicious circumstance,
immediately upon arriving in New York, than to seek out the editor at 70
Fifth Avenue in order to invite him to chair ""my first public lecture to
be delivered at St. Mark's Hall, 57 W. 38th Street."" A secretary's
polite note of regret, April 29, 1916, informed Marcus Garvey that the
editor would be ""out of town."" When, during Du Bois's serious illness at
the end of the year, a prominent African-American wrote that his loss
would have been ""a racial calamity,"" William Henry Crogman spoke for the
great majority of black
people.[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-8){#cha-8}

Du Bois's influence among northern whites outside the NAACP orbit was
solidifying, although it would never live up to his own expectations of
what it should be. But there was a growing number of tributes, as when,
one glacial November evening in 1915, nine hundred Manchester, New
Hampshire, townspeople turned out to hear ""The World Problem of the
Color Line,"" a stimulating lecture containing the nub of Du Bois's
[Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i} roots-of-war essay. There was a gratifying
letter from Walter Lippmann in January 1916, stating that, as a result
of their recent conversation, the [New Republic]{.epub-i} would
capitalize Negro from then
on.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-9){#cha-9} What little growing
influence he had among the mainstream public, Du Bois used to the
fullest during spring and summer of 1915 to fight against the screening
of [The Birth of a Nation.]{.epub-i} The film, then titled [The
Clansman,]{.epub-i} had premiered at Clune's Auditorium in Los Angeles
on February 8, 1915. The alert West Coast branch of the NAACP wired New
York that D. W. Griffith's adaptation of Thomas Dixon's popular novel
and melodrama had yielded a vicious, powerful work of racial propaganda
for the white South. The film's producers and the NAACP raced to corral
supporters, with Dixon garnering memorable endorsement by his old Johns
Hopkins classmate, Woodrow Wilson, after a screening in the East Room of
the White House on February 18. The president exclaimed that [The Birth
of a Nation]{.epub-i} (the new title) was ""like writing history with
lightning,"" adding that it was ""all so terribly
true.""[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-10){#cha-10} The chief
justice of the Supreme Court, Edward White (a former Klansman), and a
number of congressmen were similarly moved after viewing the film a few
days later. George F. Peabody found Griffith's portrayal of the
prostrate South---misruled by simian black legislators and the flower of
its womanhood menaced by rape---worthy of endorsement. Hailed by three
branches of the federal government, populated by ""68,000 People, 3,000
Horses,"" and ""8 Months in the Making,"" the film came to New York's
Liberty Theater on Forty-second Street in early
March.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-11){#cha-11}

The full membership of the National Board of Censorship of Motion
Pictures (then in New York) was aghast. ""The proprietors of the film
fought madly but the Censors met, viewed the film and immediately
withdrew their sanction,"" a breathless Du Bois told his readers. Then
came a few insignificant modifications submitted by the producers and
""this remarkable Board of Censors met a third time,"" the editor sneered,
""and passed the film over the protests of a minority of nine persons,""
including its
chairman.[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-12){#cha-12} Because [The
Birth of a Nation]{.epub-i} was such potent propaganda, its opponents
were ready to go to almost any lengths to stop it. The film's detractors
may have blundered in paying the film too much public attention, but the
medium was brand new in 1915 and its racist message, they feared, would
prove inexpungible. Du Bois readily conceded that there were ""a number
of marvelously good war pictures"" in the first half. But then came the
second part, ""with the Negro represented either as an ignorant fool, a
vicious rapist, a venal or unscrupulous politician or a faithful but
doddering idiot."" The ""main incident"" in [The Birth of a
Nation,]{.epub-i} Du Bois explained to his 35,000 readers, was the
charge that Thaddeus Stevens, ""the great abolition statesman, was
induced to give the Negroes the right to vote and secretly rejoice in
Lincoln's death because of his infatuation for a mulatto
mistress.""[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-13){#cha-13} This was
such dynamite at the time---when lynching was epidemic, segregated
residential ordinances proliferating, and hostility to migrating
African-Americans rampant in the North---that even Joel Spingarn
defended censorship. After seeing [The Birth of a Nation]{.epub-i} in
Lafayette, Indiana, a white patron would shoot a teenage
African-American boy to death. In Houston, audiences shrieked ""lynch
him!"" during a scene in which a white actor in blackface pursued Lillian
Gish. In St. Louis, real-estate interests would distribute leaflets in
front of the cinema calling for residential segregation ordinances. Du
Bois noted in [Dusk of Dawn]{.epub-i} that the ""number of mob murders so
increased that nearly one hundred Negroes were lynched during 1915 and a
score of whites, a larger number than had occurred for more than a
decade.""[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-14){#cha-14} ""We are aware
now and then that it is dangerous to limit expression,"" the editor
argued in the heat of battle, ""and yet without some limitations
civilization could not endure."" It was a ""miserable dilemma,"" and he
found his censorship views opposed by the Milhollands as well as Booker
Washington.

The paradox was that [The Birth of a Nation]{.epub-i} and the NAACP
helped make each other. Du Bois was quick to appreciate that the fight
against the film ""probably succeeded in advertising it even beyond its
admittedly notable
merits.""[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-15){#cha-15} But the fight
also mobilized thousands of black and white men and women in large
cities across the country (outside the Deep South) who had been unaware
of the existence of the association or indifferent to it. Singing
marchers, well-dressed picketers, drums of printers' ink, and court
injunctions accompanied the film in its circuit of openings. The
association succeeded in blocking its showing in Pasadena, California,
and Wilmington, Delaware. In Chicago, Republican Mayor ""Big Bill""
Thompson, anticipating a close primary race and attentive to Julius
Rosenwald, appointed Reverend Archibald Carey, AME bishop and NAACP
stalwart, to the board of censors. The city board promptly banned the
film---temporarily. In New York City, after the National Board of
Censorship defeat, the fight was carried on at the mimeograph machine
and on the picket line. The calumny at the heart of the film mobilized
the National Urban League, the [New Republic,]{.epub-i} Jewish and
Protestant religious leaders, and the flower of reform (Addams, Wald,
Wise, Villard) to march in lockstep with the NAACP to city hall. The
Tuskegee Machine also rallied, although Charley Anderson and Fred Moore
stole a march on the NAACP-led delegation to reach Mayor John Purroy
Mitchel first. The five hundred men and women who crammed into the
mayor's antechamber along with Du Bois, Ovington, Villard, and Spingarn
made a spirited appeal. Mayor Mitchel temporized, several deletions were
ordered, courts deliberated requests for injunctions, and by the end of
March New Yorkers waited in long lines to buy
tickets.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-16){#cha-16}

The NAACP's fight against [The Birth of a Nation]{.epub-i} would last
for years, recharging in the early 1930s when the film was rereleased
with a sound track. The initial contest closed with Du Bois, Ovington,
and Spingarn heading for Boston where Trotter's National Equal Rights
League and the Bookerites (working independently of each other) led by
William Lewis had generated a public furor. The failing Wizard had
earlier wired the Boston [Transcript]{.epub-i} that if the film couldn't
be stopped, ""it ought to be modified or changed materially."" (His
reaction to Hollis Frissell's decision to show the film to Hampton
students is unknown.)[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-17){#cha-17}
Mayor James M. Curley's compromise before the April 10 opening was to
order deletion of scenes depicting slavering South Carolina black
legislators, an interracial wedding, and an attempted rape. Griffith,
who had come to the public meeting with the mayor to make a game
defense, offered his hand to Storey, who icily refused it. Ovington and
Butler Wilson's wife were enraptured by the gesture---a distinguished
white gentleman publicly cutting another white gentleman over a black
controversy. Trotter and his followers charged the segregated movie
house on the tenth, clashing with the police, and throwing eggs at the
screen when a handful (minus the jailed Trotter) were finally admitted.
Thousands gathered at Faneuil Hall eight days later, joined by the
United Irish League (representing another maligned, subject people),
marching from there up Beacon Street to the statehouse singing ""Nearer
My God to Thee.""[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-18){#cha-18} A
mass rally on the Common was held that same Sunday afternoon, with Du
Bois placing the occasion in racial context.

With the governor ordering the film banned and the Massachusetts
legislature poised to enact the Sullivan Censorship Law, Woodrow Wilson
and George Peabody corrected their earlier enthusiasms. As Du Bois left
for a rest in Jamaica, [The Crisis]{.epub-i} milked the Chicago and
Boston successes for all they were worth, typically failing to detail
the crucial role played by Trotter and the NERL. He did not propose ""to
burden [The Crisis]{.epub-i} simply with names, and particularly names
of small organizations,"" the editor sniffed to an unhappy Boston
letter-writer.[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-19){#cha-19} While
Griffith's film went on to gross unprecedented millions (Louis B.
Mayer's ground-floor investment would transform fledgling
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer into the giant of the industry), Du Bois and
Ovington explored an offer from Carl Laemmle of Universal Pictures to
make a film called [Lincoln's Dream,]{.epub-i} provided that the NAACP
could contribute ten thousand dollars to the
cost.[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-20){#cha-20} Ovington thought
she could raise the money, and Albert Hart approved an outline scenario,
but Du Bois quickly lost interest. Others in the association toyed with
promoting [Rachel,]{.epub-i} a play by Angelina GrimkÃ©, Archibald's
gifted daughter, as a worthy (and infinitely cheaper) foil to [The Birth
of a Nation.]{.epub-i} There was no interest at 70 Fifth Avenue in Du
Bois's pageant. Part of the reason for disinterest in [The Star of
Ethiopia]{.epub-i} may have been the feeling that it would make a static
and prohibitively costly film. Villard and soon Joel Spingarn tended to
be highly critical at this time of Du Bois's outside interests,
including the pageant. Yet [The Star of Ethiopia,]{.epub-i} which played
to large crowds over several nights in Washington and Philadelphia, was
to be the most thoughtful, ambitious theatrical response to Dixon and
Griffith's racist epic. There was also irony in the eventual loss of
\$140,000 by Julius Rosenwald and the able business types affiliated
with the Tuskegee Machine who attempted to bring [The Birth of a
Race]{.epub-i} to the screen, a project conceived by Emmett Scott and
filmed atrociously by The Selig Polyscope
Company.[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-21){#cha-21}

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[FIVE WEEKS]{.epub-sc} before the Los Angeles premiere of [The Birth of
a Nation,]{.epub-i} the January [Crisis]{.epub-i} had carried belated
news of a White House debate that had astonished the country, and which
had everything to do with the national deterioration in race relations.
Accompanied by officers of his National Independent Political League
(another variation of the NERL), Trotter had returned to Washington in
November 1914 for a second interview with Woodrow Wilson. A year
earlier, press secretary Joseph P. Tumulty had arranged a
thirty-five-minute audience during which Trotter, Wells-Barnett, Murray,
Gunner, and Sinclair had presented the president with a petition signed
by twenty thousand persons in thirty-six states protesting racial
segregation.[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-22){#cha-22} This
November 1913 colloquium had gone extremely well for the White House,
with the usually remote Wilson charming the delegation with affable
assurances of concern. In the interim, however, as each month's
[Crisis]{.epub-i} revealed, the plight of black people had grown
steadily worse. Armed with an executive order, cabinet officers Albert
Burleson, William McAdoo, and Josephus Daniels, southerners all, had
proceeded to purify federal workspaces of African-American civil
servants shortly after Wilson's inauguration. In the well of the House
and Senate, southern lawmakers raged against the presence of nineteen
thousand African-Americans on the federal payroll, called for the
segregation of African-Americans in public parks, facilities, and
transportation in the District of Columbia, the elimination of
commissions for nonwhites in the armed services, and for the exclusion
from the United States of all immigrants of African descent. Cafeterias
in the post office, treasury, and navy departments were placed
off-limits at all times to nonwhites; lavatories to accommodate both
sexes twice sprang up like kudzu. Photographs were suddenly required by
the Civil Service Commission on all applications. Of thirty-one
honorific, federal patronage positions held by African-Americans in
1913, eight would remain three years
later.[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-23){#cha-23}

Shortly before the first Trotter delegation had headed for Washington,
Du Bois published ""Another Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson"" in the
September 1913 [Crisis.]{.epub-i} As it had turned out, the president
had not needed black votes to win the 1912 election; two million more
Americans had voted for him than for the second-place Roosevelt. But an
honorable man must keep his word, Du Bois protested. It was no
exaggeration to say, sir, that ""every enemy of the Negro race is greatly
encouraged; that every man who dreams of making the Negro race a group
of menials and pariahs is alert and hopeful.... Vardaman, Tillman, Hoke
Smith, Cole Blease and Burleson are evidently assuming that their theory
of the place and destiny of the Negro race is the theory of your
administration.... [The Crisis]{.epub-i} still clings to the conviction
that a vote for Woodrow Wilson was NOT a vote for Cole Blease or Hoke
Smith.""[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-24){#cha-24} Villard, as
credulous as Du Bois, had had his civil rights illusions shattered when
his plans for a National Race Commission, a fifteen-person, ""scientific,
nonpartisan"" fact-finding body, were scuttled. ""I see no way out,"" his
friend the president had confessed over lunch morosely in early October
1913. ""It will take a very big man to solve this
thing.""[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-25){#cha-25} From Abenia,
his Saratoga Springs estate, the usually sanguine Peabody, observing the
abandonment of the African-American by his friend Wilson, solemnly
warned his fellow paternalists, ""If the friends of the Negro do not now
stand up for him it will be most difficult to make opportunities in the
future to do it effectively."" The radicals were gaining, and Peabody
startled Hampton's Dr. Pangloss by writing Hollis Frissell that ""if I
were a Negro I should have no use for Hampton or any other place that
did not in a quiet, dignified way express its opinion"" of the
president's attitude.[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-26){#cha-26}

When an out-of-patience Monroe Trotter and the NIPL delegates entered
the White House a second time, on November 12, 1914, Woodrow Wilson was
in the worst possible mental state over the death of his wife. Just
three days earlier he had written a friend that he wanted ""to run away,
to escape something.""[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-27){#cha-27}
There was no escape from Trotter. The founder of the NIPL bluntly stated
that he and his associates had returned to protest the continuing
segregation in the federal bureaucracy. Wilson gravely explained that
""segregation was caused by friction between the colored and white
clerks, and not done to injure or humiliate the colored clerks, but to
avoid friction."" Trotter interrupted to say that African-Americans were
not wards of the government. The problem of federal segregation had been
drastically accelerated ""soon after your inauguration."" The president
snapped, ""Your manner offends me."" ""How?"" Trotter wanted to know. ""You
are the only American citizen that has ever come into this office who
has talked to me with a background of passion that was evident."" Trotter
respectfully assured Wilson that he ""misinterpreted earnestness for
passion."" Voices were raised; they began to interrupt each other. When
Trotter broke in to tell Wilson, ""Two years ago you were regarded as a
second Abraham Lincoln,"" the agitated Virginia Democrat ordered that
there be no further personal references. But the Bostonian barreled on
to say that those leaders who had supported Wilson's election were being
denounced in the churches ""as traitors to our race."" (The Bookerite
[Age]{.epub-i} reminded readers that Du Bois, Trotter, and Waldron had
helped make possible the Democratic administration.) A furious exchange
and the verbal expulsion of the NIPL delegation followed, with the
president telling his press secretary afterward that he had lost his
temper ""and played the fool."" Whether or not, as Trotter believed,
Wilson had recovered his composure and smiled as the group left his
office, Tumulty was struck dumb when Trotter held a press conference in
the White House, reenacting the debate through verbatim
quotes.[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-28){#cha-28}

In an era when it was deemed a prodigious favor for a distinguished
black leader to be granted an audience with the president of the United
States, Trotter's impertinence was almost beyond belief. Julius
Rosenwald and Albert Pillsbury deplored his ""rude"" behavior, as did
Moton, who sent Wilson a letter from Hampton regretting the ""very
unfortunate incident of Mr. Trotter."" It was hardly necessary to observe
that Booker Washington (sinking fast at St. Luke's) would never have
been guilty of such conduct, even though he had publicly pronounced
himself deeply troubled by the administration's policies. Much of the
white press shared the sense of consternation that prevailed in the
White House and in the South. Leading national newspapers and journals
of opinion, however, repeated the judgments of the New York
[World]{.epub-i} and the [New Republic,]{.epub-i} which found Wilson's
""complaint of the 'intolerable burden' of his own office"" inappropriate
to people ""who come to the President with real grievances due to the
Presidents own inaction in a moral
crisis.""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-29){#cha-29}
Notwithstanding the NAACP's public meetings, letter-writing campaign,
lobbying on Capitol Hill, [Crisis]{.epub-i} editorials, the
well-publicized official [Letter to President Wilson]{.epub-i} in August
1913, and Nerney's carefully documented pamphlet, [Segregation in
Government Departments,]{.epub-i} in December, Trotter's White House
debate exposed the president's hypocrisy as nothing before had succeeded
in doing.[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-30){#cha-30}

Du Bois was unequivocally supportive of Trotter's position in this
instance. It made amends, to some extent, for his bad-faith response to
Trotters November 1913 White House audience, which he had failed to
notice until the February issue of [The Crisis.]{.epub-i} Now he awarded
his difficult friend a full editorial in the December 1914 issue,
followed by the complete text of the November exchange in January, along
with a full survey of press reactions. Du Bois generously praised
Trotter for voicing ""the feelings of nine-tenths of the thinking Negroes
of this country."" As for Woodrow Wilson, Du Bois indicted him as being
""by birth and education unfitted for largeness of view or depth of
feeling"" on the race
question.[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-31){#cha-31} The
magazines generosity toward Trotter was temporary, however. Later that
year, when covering the NIPL's vanguard role in opposing [The Birth of a
Nation,]{.epub-i} Du Bois reverted to muted or elliptical response. To
critics like Storey and Villard, GrimkÃ© and Wells-Barnett, this was the
sort of egocentric, stubborn behavior they had learned to expect
periodically from the nation's most distinguished African-American
intellectual and civil libertarian. That memorable line from Joel
Spingarn's letter of October 24, 1914---""your mind will find or even
invent reasons or quibbles of any kind to prove that you were never
mistaken""---expressed their feelings
precisely.[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-32){#cha-32} Ego and
obduracy were integral to Du Bois's makeup, certainly---he was touched
with a sense of infallibility. But when these characteristics worked to
the advantage of collective effort, another name for them was vision.

Seeing his people's predicament as that of an undermanned fire brigade
facing an inferno, the editor came to regard uncoordinated and freelance
undertakings within the race as nothing less than reprehensible.
""Organization is sacrifice,"" he catechized readers in the April 1915
[Crisis.]{.epub-i} ""It is sacrifice of opinions, of time, of work and of
money, but it is, after all, the cheapest way of buying the most
priceless of gifts---freedom and
efficiency.""[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-33){#cha-33} It was
not a question of power hunger, and only moderate impatience with
dissent, but passion in pursuit of a common objective. As his renown and
influence grew among the educated, surpassing that of Booker Washington,
as the membership of the NAACP climbed above ten thousand, as the
readership of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} passed the thirty thousand mark, and
as the Tuskegee Machine crumbled and the well-funded Urban League began
to confine itself to business networking and research, Du Bois saw a
unique opportunity to expand and consolidate civil rights
forces.[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-34){#cha-34} When he
deplored the dismissal of Charley Anderson from his Internal Revenue
Service post in the spring of 1914, the editor's gesture was both a
genuine tribute to Anderson's superior professionalism and a sign of
welcome to Bookerites scurrying from Wilson's scythe. Some, like Roscoe
Bruce, who had landed the D.C. school superintendency once coveted by Du
Bois, signed on. In Trotter's case, Du Bois could not help feeling that
the common objective was handicapped by an eccentric independence backed
by little more than a newspaper and a few hundred people in Boston,
Chicago, and Washington. Several of the NAACP officers privately
reproached the NIPL for refusing to share access to the White House.
Still, whatever the momentary notoriety of others, Du Bois's own
leadership position now towered above all. Ferris's celebration of Du
Bois's ascendancy may have been somewhat premature in 1913; by 1916 that
ascendancy was a fact.

He still had detractors, and they were numerous. Editors Fred Moore and
Calvin Chase could always amuse their readers by poking fun at Du Bois's
alleged hauteur. Crisis editorials remained anathema in faculty lounges
at Hampton and Tuskegee. His friend Major Charles Young alerted him in
January 1916 to a rumor that the Justice Department's new Bureau of
Investigation was looking into gossip about Du Bois's personal life. The
editor realized that Ninas absence in England had ""led to endless table
talk and conjecture as to things that people have not seen,"" but, in
thanking Young for his vigilance, he told Young that he was quite
unconcerned.[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-35){#cha-35} Trotter
and GrimkÃ© continued to attack Du Bois's public character, and were soon
joined by Neval H. Thomas, a District of Columbia adversary who by
comparison would make Trotter seem positively meek. For Villard,
dyspepsia and Du Bois were usually inseparable. The editor's readiness
to take on the General Education Board and the Southern Education Board
in 1915, just as the Rockefeller interests were fixing the parameters of
privately funded higher education in black America for the next fifteen
years, was deemed to be an infuriating impertinence by the
""philanthropoids."" Peabody's advice to his philanthropic friends---that
they try placing themselves in Du Bois's shoes as a gifted, scorned
black intellectual---failed utterly to persuade
them.[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-36){#cha-36} Unsympathetic
white students of race relations attempting to explain Du Bois began to
characterize him as a ""marginal man,"" a typology that had a propensity
to degenerate into a modern version of the tragic
mulatto.[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-37){#cha-37} But in Du
Bois's case, marginality, for all its deracination, tension, and
reinvention, meant the very opposite of impotence and tragedy. His
offended ego and rage at personal and collective injustice swept
increasing numbers of African-Americans as well as whites into its force
field. Du Bois's marginality was of the conquering variety that
ultimately compelled the prevailing hierarchies of values and power to
take it into account and even to seek an accommodation with it.

[The Crisis]{.epub-i} spoke to a widening range of issues with
impassioned authority, reaching a circulation of 45,000 by April 1916.
Sometimes readers needed strong stomachs. ""The Lynching Industry,"" a
tabulation by year of the 2,732 African-Americans lynched between 1885
and 1914, supplemented by names, dates, and states of those murdered
during the twelve months of 1914, was a statistical horror story. ""All
this goes to show how peculiarly fitted the United States is for moral
leadership of the world,"" Du Bois
scoffed.[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-38){#cha-38} The group
lynching of six black men in Lee County, Georgia, the following year,
was depicted in full-page ghoulishness in the April 1916
[Crisis.]{.epub-i} ""The Waco Horror,"" reported in June and July, broke
new ground in lynch journalism. Walling and several others were shocked
by the choice of cover for the June issue---the ghastly, burnt-cork husk
of Jesse Washington suspended by chain from a tree. Du Bois poured into
the special July supplement the bloodstained detail of an undercover
investigation. Studin and Arthur Spingarn warned the board that the
magazine still contained libelous statements, even after the several
deletions that Du Bois had consented to
make.[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-39){#cha-39} [The
Crisis]{.epub-i} carried lengthy, verbatim statements by lynching-party
participants, and Du Bois editorialized with his usual withering irony.
The young victim was a mentally impaired field hand who, after raping
and killing his white employer's wife in the kitchen, returned to hoe
cotton placidly beside the husband, son, and daughter. Jailed for
safekeeping in Dallas and then tried in Waco, he was set upon and
dragged from the courthouse by most of the white men, women, and
children of the town. Hitched to a car and dragged till the chain broke,
Jesse Washington's ears were severed, his body doused with kerosene,
pieces carved from it, and, in final Gothic glee, the shouting,
cavorting townspeople hoisted him to a tree on the courthouse lawn and
finished incinerating him. Woodrow Wilson was still to redeem his
promise to denounce lynching.

When [The Crisis]{.epub-i} looked beyond Lee County and Waco, prospects
were somewhat more encouraging. The issue for June 1916 related the
discrimination suffered by Dr. Anna M. Comfort, the nation's oldest
living female physician, when she had been a student at New York's
Bellevue Medical School in the 1860s. Du Bois rarely missed an
opportunity to illustrate the connection between the battle for the
liberation of women and the civil rights of his own people and others.
Returning to the theme in the September issue, he presaged after the war
""the advent of many things---notably the greater emancipation of
European women, the downfall of monarchies, the gradual but certain
dissolution of caste and the advance of true Socialism."" Another outcome
of the war, he thought, would be the national liberation of Poland. He
had decided by 1916 that Germany would lose the war---that it should
lose the war. For all its faults, Great Britain stood for the right
principles of parliamentarianism, liberalism, and colonial
responsibility---""as the best administrator of colored
peoples""---although by the war's end he would write of a ""great dull
doubt in my mind---a feeling of world apprehension."" In the global
mayhem of the present, it was the German empire that deserved condign
censure. ""Compared with Germany,"" England was an ""Angel of light."" The
record of the Second Reich was the ""most barbarous of any civilized
people."" Like many other Americans educated in Germany, Du Bois's
reaction to Germany's war conduct sprang from emotions deeper than
patriotism. Thorstein Veblen blamed the war on the romantic,
unscientific character of that nation's schools of philosophy. In
[German Philosophy and Politics,]{.epub-i} John Dewey arraigned [The
Critique of Pure Reason]{.epub-i} as the root of German militarism. It
was as if they and Du Bois were driven to abjure and recant the
intellectual affections of their youth out of bitter, heartfelt
disenchantment. He had ""deep cause to love the German people,"" Du Bois
reminded readers. Twenty years ago, they had made it possible for him to
""believe in the essential humanity of white folk when he was near to
denying it."" All the more reason, then, to denounce them for trampling
world morality and order under the heel of Hindenburg and the Prussian
general staff. The beloved Germany of Beethoven and Goethe had been
betrayed by that of Nietzsche and von
Treitschke.[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-40){#cha-40}

On the other hand, Du Bois carefully checked any creeping Anglo-philia.
He championed Irish liberation, writing of the old enmity in America
between African-Americans and the Irish, ""All this is past.""
Editorializing about the 1916 Easter Rebellion, he mused that it may
have been foolish, ""but would to God some of us had sense enough to be
fools!"" A month later, apotheosizing Sir Roger Casement, the Irish
patriot hanged by the British, Du Bois cited Casement's exposÃ©s of
atrocities in the Congo, South America, and Turkey. Of British justice
in this case, Du Bois wrote, ""Someone has
blundered.""[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-41){#cha-41} In
defending the Irish, did the editor intend to forsake ""culture,
refinement, service and love""? a distressed young woman asked. Du Bois
gave a debater's answer that fell short of actually embracing
assassination, sedition, and war. ""Terrible as it may be,"" he lectured,
""the awful fact faces the colored races in this world. That no human
group has ever achieved freedom without being compelled to murder
thousands of members of other groups who were determined that they
should be slaves."" He hoped for the young woman's sake it would not be
necessary. ""War is Hell,"" he ended, ""but there are things worse than
Hell, as every Negro
knows.""[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-42){#cha-42}

One thing worse than hell was the grinding down year after year of black
people in the Deep South. The conservative leadership represented by
Moton called on the race to stay put, while police in Georgia were being
armed with rifles to stop folk from leaving the towns. The October 1916
[Crisis]{.epub-i} cheered the outmigration, predicted its geometric
increase, and placed it in the broad context of global industrialization
enabling Jews from Russia and peasants from Austria to escape oppression
and find economic
opportunity.[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-43){#cha-43} In a
witheringly frank letter to Professor Paul Hanus, the current president
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the
ostensible topic was Hampton (""deliberately educating a servile class""),
but Du Bois's larger concern was social and economic adaptability. The
fact of the matter was, he wrote Hanus, ""if the Negro race survives in
America and in modern civilization it will be because it assimilates
that civilization and develops leaders of large intelligent
calibre.""[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-44){#cha-44} Du Bois saw
early on that the great migration would be a powerful agency in that
assimilation.

On to and out of the pages of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} walked persons of
great significance and many whose prominence was fleeting. Beautiful
babies, debutantes, families on the steps of spacious homes, successful
businesspersons, high school valedictorians, a white northern university
or college's first African-American graduate (but not from Princeton or
Vassar, Du Bois regularly reminded readers), annual conventions of
professional organizations and Greek letter societies, and
more.[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-45){#cha-45} The issue for
May 1916 contained a brief announcement utterly belying the capital
significance of its subject. It reported that Marcus Garvey had arrived
in New York from the West Indies and would be giving a series of
lectures ""in an effort to raise funds for the establishment of an
industrial and educational institution for Negroes in Jamaica."" Garvey's
prospects went unappreciated, but the deaths of William Ward and Josiah
Royce were noted with poignancy in November 1916, as were those of Inez
Milholland Boissevain and the African-American YMCA official William A.
Hunton, whose able son Alphaeus would join Du Bois in devoted West
African exile forty-three years
later.[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-46){#cha-46}

The stellar career of Charles Young was tracked almost monthly: his
return from attachÃ© duty in Liberia, in January 1916, to assume a
command in occupied Haiti; a striking photo of the major in dress
uniform and sword in March as the second Spingarn Medalist and current
squadron commander in the 10th U.S. Cavalry. In May, Major Young was
with U.S. expeditionary forces in Mexico (""foolish venture""); in October
(one of the ""Men of the Month""), the new lieutenant colonel's children
were reported to have left Belgium safely to continue schooling in the
United States. The editor's good friend, as an outstanding West Point
graduate and the most combat-experienced officer of his rank, would be
eligible in the near future for command of a brigade. Young had served
as a captain in the Philippines, seeing action in such hot spots as
Samar and Blanca Aurora. A stint in military intelligence in Washington
had followed, then exemplary duty in the chaotic Liberian backcountry
where he was ambushed and wounded while organizing the country's
frontier forces. ""His service in the Army has been highly creditable to
his race from any standpoint,"" General Leonard Wood, former chief of
staff of the army, wrote his Troutbeck neighbor Spingarn upon Young's
return from Liberia, a letter Spingarn passed along to his
friend.[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-47){#cha-47} In the
increasingly likely event that the United States entered the European
war, Du Bois counted on General Young to lead the Talented Tenth into
battle.

[Dusk of Dawn]{.epub-i} credited Joel Spingarn with the idea for the
Amenia Conference, but it would not have been possible without Du Bois's
enthusiasm. With a sense of history shifting gears, he would write that
Amenia ""marked the end of an era and the
beginning.""[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-48){#cha-48} The NAACP
had intended to hold its 1916 annual meeting on February 12, Lincoln's
birthday. When Emmett Scott and the Bookerites announced that their
memorial service for Booker Washington would be held on that day,
however, Du Bois and Spingarn, seeing a unique opportunity to bring the
factions together later that year, persuaded the association to postpone
its affair. Du Bois joined the chairman in a plan for a conference of
all factions ""in the peace and quiet of
Amenia.""[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-49){#cha-49} Although
""under the auspices of the NAACP,"" the assembly was carefully
characterized as an independent affair. The two hundred or so
invitations for August 24 through 26 were issued in Spin-garn's name as
master of Troutbeck in Dutchess County, New York. The invitees, both
white and black, came from across the civil rights spectrum---from
Monroe Trotter through Kelly Miller to Emmett Scott. Du Bois was pleased
to make a show of objectivity and to assume a secondary role in the
actual proceedings. When his opinion was sought about one guest in
particular---""the editor of a certain paper"" who had had ""an exceedingly
good time at any expense""---Du Bois noted that ""Mr. Spingarn was pleased
to see that I agreed with him in this."" The nuts and bolts of organizing
the Amenia Conference largely fell to Roy Nash, an affable young man
about whose competence there were mounting concerns as he was inclined
to sit in his office writing memos inviting suggestions for something to
do; but Nash did an excellent job procuring and shipping the array of
tents, cots, mattress covers, blankets, and towels needed for the
conference. The lot went off from New York on August 15, with a note to
Spingarn about providing straw ""for filling the mattresses up
there.""[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-50){#cha-50}

Despite appearances, Du Bois was the moving force behind Amenia, and
Nash had dutifully traveled and returned earlier that same day to confer
with him at Sea Isle City, New Jersey, about the final details of the
conference program. Leaving the running of [The Crisis]{.epub-i} to
Fauset and Dill, the editor was recovering from an attack of kidney
stones that would necessitate surgery at the end of the year, but his
powers of concentration were unimpaired. Nina and Yolande may have been
with him, although there is no mention of them in correspondence from
this period. The editor received Nash with a range of ""suggestions"" that
was actually a schematic design for the conference. He had already
divided Spingarn's invitation list into Niagarites, Washingtonians, and
others. John Hope might preside over a session on higher education.
Chesnutt, the novelist and insurance executive, could conduct the
education and industry discussions. Bookerite James Napier, dismissed by
Wilson as register of the treasury, and now president of the National
Negro Business League, could lead a roundtable on industrial
opportunity. Lucy Laney, founder of an influential elementary school in
Augusta, Georgia, and Judge Robert Terrell, a rare survivor of the
federal purge, were suggested as moderators of what Du Bois called
""practical path"" roundtables. Nash reported to Spingarn that Du Bois had
insisted that James Weldon Johnson's address ought come on the final
afternoon, rather than the first day, ""for fear that the line Johnson
wants to follow will simply crystallize the Conference into two hard
groups.""[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-51){#cha-51} Johnson was
suspected of being too pro-Tuskegee. Nash was also carefully lectured on
the significance of seventy-year-old John R. Lynch's attendance. ""Du
Bois says that by all odds he is the most distinguished colored man
there, barring none."" A fine relic of Reconstruction, the tall,
sharp-featured former speaker of the Mississippi House of
Representatives had gaveled the 1884 Republican National Convention to
order and been a U. S. army major in the Cuban occupation. Lynch should
speak on the last afternoon, Du Bois suggested, and the ""so diffident""
Moton (""Major"" Moton, as his peers called him) ""might perhaps feel that
we were making him bear more than his fair share"" if asked to chair the
first afternoon.[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-52){#cha-52}

The cast had continued to shift until the last days before the
conference, with the white invitees eventually deciding that the
proceedings would be better served by their absence. Milholland went to
California, Ovington to Seal Harbor, Maine. George Peabody, Florence
Kelley, and Ray Baker sent regrets, and Samuel Gompers's unavailability
was anticipated.[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-53){#cha-53} Among
the African-Americans who did not attend were Trotter and Moton. The
founder of the NIPL had decided to stay away just three days before the
conference was to begin. The new Tuskegee principal's final decision may
have been influenced by ""An Open Letter to Robert Russa Moton"" that
July, an exceptionally restrained editorial for Du Bois, but a stern,
somewhat patronizing warning to Moton, nevertheless, to watch his
accommodationist inclinations. Du Bois's personal letter to Moton in
mid-July, intended to smooth their differences, may only have made
matters worse.[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-54){#cha-54} But in
the absence of the Wizard's successor, Emmett Scott, Fred Moore, and
William Lewis came to represent their cause. The independent-minded
Kelly Miller shared a tent with AME bishop Levi J. Coppin. Ill health
kept Charley Anderson, Roscoe Bruce, and Francis Cardozo from
attending.[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-55){#cha-55} Carter
Godwin Woodson, a recent African-American history Ph.D. from Harvard,
sent regrets. Woodson had just begun editing his [Journal of Negro
History]{.epub-i} that January, publicized in [The Crisis]{.epub-i} with
Du Bois's reproach that thus far it ""has [only 1000
subscribers.]{.epub-i}"" Archibald GrimkÃ© stayed away, but Francis shared
tent number four with Charles Chesnutt and J. Rosamond Johnson, the
brother of James. Tent number one housed Mary Terrell, Lucy Laney,
Nannie Burroughs, the founder of National Training School for Women and
Girls in the District of Columbia, and Mary Burnett Talbert, the current
president of the National Association of Colored
Women.[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-56){#cha-56}

No sooner did Du Bois set eyes on Troutbeck for the first time than he
rhapsodized that he ""knew it was mine. It was just a long southerly
extension of my own Berkshire
Hills.""[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-57){#cha-57} Joel and Amy
Spingarn's manor house with its Tudor facing and steeply inclined roof
was about two miles from the town. A stream pierced the rolling, wooded
grounds, widening as it flowed through a broad clearing where eleven
tents to shelter about fifty men and women conferees were set up. The
immensely pleased Du Bois doubted ""if ever before so small a conference
of American Negroes had so many colored men of distinction"" who
represented practically ""all phases of Negro thought."" The opening
morning of the conference, Thursday, he described as ""misty with a
northern chill in the air and a dampness all
about.""[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-58){#cha-58} There were
pockets of tension and some posturing; old grievances lurked just below
the surface civilities. But by Saturday afternoon, the impeccable
hospitality of the Spingarns, the arrival of messages from Theodore
Roosevelt, William Taft, Charles Evans Hughes, and Woodrow Wilson,
flattering visits from Governor Charles A. Whitman, Congressman William
S. Bennett, ""a university president, an army officer,"" and other
prominent white people, and the perfect weather and catered meals all
conspired to camaraderie and confidence. Attorney Inez Boissevain's
visit delighted the connoisseur in Du Bois. John Milholland's tall,
brunette daughter (who had given him a dressing down for not speaking)
was ""in the glory of her young womanhood,"" he sighed, but she would die
within the year, tumbling exhausted from a suffragist platform in
California.[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-59){#cha-59} There was
tennis, which Du Bois played well, and croquet, which the women played
without bonnets. A delighted Chesnutt attributed the success of the
three days to Spingarn and the collegial Nash. With a ""few more men like
you in the United States, the solution of race problems would be a
matter of a very short time,"" he graciously exaggerated in his note to
the master of
Troutbeck.[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-60){#cha-60}

Instead of keeping to their original plan of secrecy, the conferees
voted to make public what Du Bois characterized as ""a virtual unanimity
of opinion in regard to certain principles."" ""All forms of education""
were desirable; the races ""highest development"" was impossible without
""complete political freedom""; antiquated subjects of controversy and
""ancient suspicions and factional alignments"" must be banished. They had
now ""learned to understand and respect"" the ""peculiar difficulties"" that
southern race leaders faced in promoting racial advancement; and all
endorsed the view that the leaders ought to hold annual meetings ""for
private and informal discussions under conditions similar to those"" at
Amenia. ""Probably on account of our meeting, the Negro race was more
united and more ready to meet the problems of the world,"" Du Bois would
proclaim later.[[61]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-61){#cha-61} In
reality, the Amenia Conference would prove to have been remarkable
mainly because it had taken place. It marked a definite shift in the
balance of power within black America, a reflection of the increasingly
industrial, northern, and national character of the American Dilemma. It
affirmed the NAACP's primacy as advocate of the rights and protections
under the Constitution of Americans of African descent, but it
accomplished much less in the way of converting veteran Bookerites to
the activist goals of the NAACP. If the conservatives hoped for more
understanding and respect from Du Bois, they were sharply disabused by
the [Crisis]{.epub-i} editorial, ""Hampton,"" in November 1917, in which
education at the institute was dismissed as ""a wellnigh fatal loss of
time.""[[62]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-62){#cha-62} Trotterites
remained as suspicious as ever of Du Bois and the association's
monopolizing tendencies. The legacy from Troutbeck was far less one of
genuine understanding and real unity than of cosmetic harmony and
pragmatic tolerance among the various factions now more than ever
pressed by forces of implacable racism abroad in the land. There would
not be another Amenia Conference until 1933.

At some point, Du Bois, in tent number eight, revealed to the conference
his long-term prognosis about the struggle for rights ""in the face of so
deep-seated and unreasonable human force as American race prejudice."" Du
Bois's remarks were as grim as they were far-sighted. No direct frontal
attack, ""however courageous and high of principle, can be of the
slightest avail,"" he foresaw. Several more generations would suffer
under disfranchisement and separate and unequal schools. ""Only through
this valley of human nature"" could the goal of true equality be reached.
But if the goal was distant, the team was now being assembled in order
to pursue it. His estimate of what had been accomplished recalled his
euphoria at the 1911 Races Congress. Like those London ballrooms, Du
Bois found Troutbeck a fitting place from which to launch a new era in
race relations. How appropriate, then, ""that so fateful a thing should
have taken place in the midst of so much quiet and beauty, in a place of
poets and fishermen, of dreamers and
farmers.""[[63]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-63){#cha-63} In addition
to fixing a truce among African-American leaders, Amenia repaired and
deepened the bond between the editor and the chairman. It would lead to
a surprising willingness to undertake a course of action that would seem
to others at odds with Du Bois's convictions. The easy grace of squire
Spingarn in his well-endowed demesne, his notable neighbors and
establishment entrÃ©e, the family library with sunlight streaming through
leaded glass panes on to oak bookcases, the well-stocked wine
cellar---all this affected Alexander Du Bois's grandson, a racial
radical but far from a social leveler.

Woodrow Wilson and Charles Hughes had sent their greetings to Amenia,
but Du Bois called down a plague on both presidential candidates that
year. ""Between these two great parties,"" the October [Crisis]{.epub-i}
announced, ""as parties there is little to choose."" Hughes and the GOP
(now supported by Roosevelt) were the ""natural enemy of the humble
working people who compose the mass of Negroes."" Wilson's record in the
White House fairly taxed the editor's civility. The signal exception, Du
Bois wrote, was the nomination of Louis Brandeis (""a modern man"") to the
Supreme Court, able, principled, sympathetic to labor, and knowing the
meaning of ""'despised and rejected of men,'"" An October 17 ""personal""
letter from Tumulty, the president's secretary, informing the editor
that Woodrow Wilson wished him to know that he had ""tried to live up to
them \[pledges to African-Americans\], though in some cases his
endeavors have been defeated,"" must have seemed a pathetic
rationalization.[[64]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-64){#cha-64} Not
only was Wilson's New Freedom a disaster for Americans of African
descent, Du Bois had repeatedly inveighed against its policies in Latin
America and the Caribbean. A U.S. expeditionary force had toppled
Mexican President Victoriano Huerta from power in 1914 and General
""Black Jack"" Pershing had invaded the country in March 1916 after Pancho
Villa, provoked by the American government's preference for his rival,
murderously struck Columbus, a border town in New Mexico. A war with
Mexico only awaited Wilson's reelection, but if America blundered ""into
murder and shame,"" Du Bois warned, ""it will not be war. It will be a
crime."" U.S. Marines, already busy policing Dominican Republicans and
Nicaraguans, had occupied Haiti in summer 1915, provoking howls from
[The Crisis]{.epub-i}---""SHAME ON AMERICA!"" Ten million
African-Americans were told to write the White House to demand an
interracial presidential commission to bring a quick, honorable end to
American violation of the republic's sovereignty. ""Hayti can, and will,
work out her destiny,"" Du Bois asserted, ""and is more civilized today
than Texas.""[[65]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-65){#cha-65}

Because four more years of Wilson's New Freedom would mean ""ascendancy
only by the help of the Solid South,"" [The Crisis]{.epub-i} proposed an
electoral strategy suggested by Inez Boissevain---""a Negro Party on the
lines of the recently formed Woman's Party."" The White House was a
Hobson's choice (indecisive, Du Bois momentarily favored Hughes), but
African-Americans could find leverage in congressional elections,
crossing party lines to vote Republican, Democrat, or Socialist, or even
fielding their own candidates. He knew, of course, that the inveterate
Republicanism of the great majority of African-Americans and the absence
of choice in the white-primary South made his desperate electoral scheme
a distant hypothetical in a rainbow coalition of the future. The
November 1916 editorial betrayed its editor's deepening
frustration---black people should vote for the Socialist presidential
candidate, Allan Benson, or stay
home.[[66]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-66){#cha-66} The irony that
Woodrow Wilson had gone to bed unsure whether he would still be
president the next day bitterly mocked Du Bois's political advice. In
1912, Wilson had become president without needing the hundred thousand
black votes he had thought it essential to bargain for. Four years
later, when his victory in California by four thousand votes decided the
election, his racial policies had made another pledge to Bishop Walters
out of the question. The solid South held a lock on a Democratic White
House. Big business made the Republicans equally unresponsive, and there
was no way out through the labor movement and socialism for the
African-American. That fall, a seeming anomaly, deplored by Marcus
Garvey during his brief visit to 70 Fifth Avenue, was addressed. Not
only were the officers of the association white, except for Du Bois, but
Garvey was surprised to find that, to his color-sensitive eyes, the
African-American staff was as white as the officers, except for Dill and
one or two others.[[67]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-67){#cha-67}
Nerney's recommendation that an African-American be retained to organize
branches had been much too long deferred. After Amenia, a consensus had
emerged that James Weldon Johnson would make the best candidate for
field organizer. Songwriter, diplomat, novelist, poet, Johnson was a
suave, self-created success on an heroic scale. ""Fifty Years,"" his
stately poem commemorating the Emancipation Proclamation, had been
exuberantly praised in [The New York Times]{.epub-i} and by Roosevelt,
Washington, Chesnutt, and Du Bois when it appeared at the beginning of
1913. The dealings between Booker Washington and the trim, cosmopolitan
Johnson were well known, however. Johnson had been treasurer of Charley
Anderson's Colored Republican Club and, with his brother, Rosamond, had
written Roosevelt's 1904 campaign song, ""You're All Right, Teddy,"" for
which James was rewarded with postings as U. S. consul general to
Venezuela and
Nicaragua.[[68]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-68){#cha-68} In 1912,
Consul Johnson had strapped a forty-five to his belt and superintended
the defense of Nicaragua's main port city, Corinto, against attack until
the arrival of U. S. Marines ended a rebellion against a pro-American
president. The Wilson State Department had declined to approve his
promised assignment to France, and the sputtering Tuskegee Machine could
do no better than make him editor of the [Age]{.epub-i} in late 1914. He
and Du Bois had been tentmates at Amenia, where the editor's
apprehensions about Johnson's Tuskegee connections had been so well
assuaged that the two of them speculated about forming a ""secret
organization"" to energize the civil rights elements represented at the
conference.[[69]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-69){#cha-69} Johnson's
gracious informality and infinite tact had impressed both Du Bois and
Spingarn.

The ex--foreign service officer was impressed by the association's
growing power and augmenting treasury. With John Hope's final decision
in late October not to seek the position offered by Spingarn, the board
approached Johnson immediately. Ovington seems to have remained
suspicious about his Bookerite background, but Du Bois and Spingarn may
have felt that this made Johnson's recruitment all the more valuable.
""Your letter appeals to me very strongly,"" Johnson replied as soon as
the chair-man's offer reached
him.[[70]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-70){#cha-70} The editor
followed Spingarn's letter with his own pitch that, after initial
misgivings, he was convinced that ""contact with human beings will be an
incentive rather than a drawback to your literary work"" (which Johnson
would have known). Du Bois reminded him of the secret organization ""that
you and I talked of sometime ago.... We might be able to tie a durable
knot to insure the permanency of the main organization"" with Johnson as
field organizer.""[[71]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-71){#cha-71}
Johnson accepted the offer in November 1916, and over the next two years
he spearheaded a phenomenally successful membership drive.

As though his people's misery were a misfortune to be borne personally,
Du Bois became seriously ill in early December 1916. ""I went down into
the valley of the shadow of death,"" he later
wrote.[[72]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-72){#cha-72} An anxious
Nina, awaiting news in their Bronx home, received word from Will's
secretary that her husband would undergo surgery on Friday the
fifteenth, 10:30 [A.M.]{.epub-sc} at St. Luke's Hospital. It was his
first major illness since those Fisk days when the college community had
hung on every bulletin. Joel Spingarn had full confidence in St. Luke's
medical staff, but he still insisted on having his personal physician
present in the operating room, ""as much for my own peace of mind as for
yours,"" he told Du Bois. Because of the long-term damage to the left
kidney, the patient's doctors determined that the organ would have to be
removed in a second operation. Du Bois sent Dr. Frances Hoggan a
clinical account of the ordeal under the knife and his six-week
recovery, as well as an apology for failure to remit his overdue debt.
Spingarn received a similar letter and a similar request for the
deferral of another loan. His painful incapacitation was such that Dill,
Ovington, and Spingarn were asked to write the editorials for December
and January.[[73]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-73){#cha-73}

The illness hushed detractors and heightened the fervency of his
admirers. The editor played to his public with all the flair of an
accomplished publicist. Job of Fisk, Harvard, and Berlin bore his
affliction in Old Testament accents. ""Above the Hill where St. John's
Divine Cathedral raises its bald and mighty arch, hang the Curtains of
Pain,"" the February editorial intoned. ""There is moaning here and
writhing and now and then a cry, and yet less, infinitely less, than one
expects."" There was ""no Race; there is no Age; there is but one
language""---that of sympathy. ""I am glad I am
here.""[[74]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-74){#cha-74} Mary Terrell's
sympathy note was unusual for its jocular tone. She wrote that, although
she had long known that Du Bois modeled himself on her, she had not
expected him to imitate her own kidney troubles of two years past. From
his Park Avenue parsonage, John Holmes trembled to think ""what it would
have meant to the members of your race, to say nothing of the cause of
liberty in general,"" had Du Bois succumbed. Mrs. Sadie Conyers, a
Brunswick, Georgia, acquaintance wrote to say how thankful she was ""that
there has been and is a Du Bois."" William Crogman of Atlanta rejoiced
that St. Luke's had spared them ""a racial calamity."" Wendell Dabney's
Cincinatti social club sent a bottle of sherry to be consumed once the
curtains of pain were raised. Spingarn received an encouraging note on
January 20: ""I am up and walking around and feeling quite well."" The
patient was discharged on January 22. A week later, he wrote Carrie
Clifford that he was ""glad to learn how important I
am.""[[75]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-75){#cha-75} His recovery was
rapid and complete.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

W[HEN]{.epub-sc} W[OODROW]{.epub-sc} W[ILSON]{.epub-sc} took America
into the Great War on April 2, 1917, Du Bois welcomed the decision. ""The
Battle of Europe,"" the mystical, apocalyptic editorial the previous
September, revealed the Du Boisian vision of a radically transformed
world order after the guns fell silent. ""Well, civilization has met its
Waterloo,"" he wrote in the aftermath of the [Lusitania.]{.epub-i} ""The
civilization by which America insists on measuring us and to which we
must conform our natural tastes and inclinations is the daughter of that
European civilization which is now rushing furiously to its doom."" ""What
good can come out of it all?"" A return to ancient ideals, was Du Bois's
answer. ""Old standards of beauty beckon us again, not the blue-eyed,
white-skinned types which are set before us in school and literature but
rich, brown and black men and women with glowing dark eyes and crinkling
hair."" The sooner the rotten edifice of racism and class exploitation
crumbled, the sooner the world would be bathed in a ""golden hue that
harks back to the heritage of Africa and the
tropics.""[[76]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-76){#cha-76} But it was
the red hue from the Urals rather than a golden glow from the sub-Sahara
that occasioned general, if temporary, rejoicing among
progressives---the news that March of Aleksandr Kerensky's overthrow of
the czar and proclamation of a republic. Du Bois believed that the
moment was more propitious than ever before for American Socialists to
embrace the principles of interracialism.

It was as one of the fifteen members of the executive committee of the
Intercollegiate Socialist Society that Du Bois made another eloquent,
carefully honed appeal to the American left soon after the November
election. He told the conference that the greatest crime of socialism
""was the conspiracy of silence"" that surrounded the Negro problem in the
United States. ""Revolution is discussed,"" he lectured, ""but it is the
successful revolution of white folk."" Black people in America had
suffered as much as Russian and Polish peasants and had struggled for
generations, sometimes violently. He went on to skewer those pacifists
among them for whom war was a horrible thing; ""but yesterday, when war
was confined to the Belgian Congo, to the headwaters of the Amazon, to
South Africa and parts of India and the South Seas it was not war, it
was simplyÂ ... carrying civilization on to the
natives.""[[77]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-77){#cha-77} Warming to
his theme, he indicted the response of white labor to the steady
northward migration of black workers. Five years earlier, in a forceful
[New Review]{.epub-i} essay, he had warned organized labor that its
exclusionary charters had convinced the American Negro that his greatest
enemy was not the employer who robs him ""but his white fellow
workingmen.... White Northern laborers find killing Negroes a safe,
lucrative employment which commends them to the American Federation of
Labor."" The emancipation of black labor, he pleaded, was fundamental to
the success of ""forward-looking and radical""
forces.[[78]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-78){#cha-78}

He was so far recovered from surgery in March that he traveled south to
speaking engagements in Atlanta, Augusta, Chattanooga, and Charleston,
South Carolina---six states in all. One purpose of the trip was to
gather information on the rising outmigration of black people. It was
evident to keen African-American observers like Carter Woodson, editor
of the [Journal of Negro History,]{.epub-i} and George Edmund Haynes,
special assistant in the U.S. Department of Labor, as well as to many of
the white progressives, that the South, the Nation, and the Negro would
be changed by this exodus, but whether it was a good thing or, as
Woodson concluded, a phenomenon in which ""the maltreatment of Negroes
will be nationalized,"" was a matter of intense discussion. While Du Bois
had been recuperating there had been two major conferences on the
controversial subject in January. At Tuskegee, Moton had presided over a
conclave of conservatives whose Bookerite resolutions deplored the
migration as unjustified and extremely unwise. In New York, the white
estate lawyer and Quaker activist L. Hollingsworth Wood had presided
over a meeting of National Urban League and NAACP officials that became
so tempestuous that Spingarn despaired for the spirit of Amenia. Butler
Wilson insisted on a motion urging African-Americans to evacuate the
South until it ""shall accord them their political
rights.""[[79]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-79){#cha-79} Du Bois's
trip would yield some of the earliest firsthand information available
concerning the migration's causation and numbers.

Atlanta---the affluent white part of it---was setting the regional pace
for suburban development. Du Bois was offended by Druid Hill, the new,
forested enclave of the Coca-Cola rich expanding along ""mile on mile of
nine-inch water mains and sewersÂ ... wrung \[by\] city taxes out of poor
blacks and whites."" In the heart of Atlanta, there were neighborhoods
where children grew sick and died ""because there is no city water"" (he
must have been thinking of Burghardt) and five thousand black children
""sit in the streets, for there are no seats in the schools."" But there
was praise for Atlanta University and John Hope's Morehouse College,
then in its fiftieth year, which boasted ""carefully selected male
students"" and ""the best athletic record of the colored
country.""[[80]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-80){#cha-80} In Augusta,
he visited Lucy Laney's remarkable, struggling academy, where Mary
McLeod Bethune had taught at the beginning of her remarkable career. It
did not offer its students much of an academic experience, with
""dishwashing substituted for English,"" but it had
heart.[[81]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-81){#cha-81}

Charleston captivated, evoking images combining deliquescence and
vitality---""subtle flavor of Old World things, a little hush in the
whirl of American doing."" It was Africa and Anglo-Saxon decay, where
""white aristocratsÂ ... perched like solemn owls about the Dead Sea of
the 'Baattery.'"" ""Colored Charleston"" generally delighted Du Bois. He
paid diplomatic calls to all the churches, ""in rhythm on a great blue
day."" A ""slim black woman whirled and screamed"" in one church. In
another, the preacher ""beat upon his audience with skillful repetitions,
which alone meant little, but his hearers surged and bowed."" In St.
Mark's Episcopal, the fifty-two-year-old godbox of the city's endogamous
mulatto upper crust, Du Bois sensed the presence of the famous slave
insurgents, Cato of the Stono rebellion and Denmark Vesey. In [The
Crisis,]{.epub-i} he railed against Charleston's peculiar violation of
separate equality---the monopoly held by white teachers in the black
public school system. Charleston's African-Americans should put a stop
to it, Du Bois commanded. Tell the white people that such an arrangement
was as incongruous as having ""Turks teaching
Armenians.""[[82]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-82){#cha-82}

He returned from the South with impressions and notes for a major essay
on migration, but before he drafted the piece, he came to terms with a
lengthy February 26 letter from Joel Spingarn about the creation of a
training camp for African-American officers. It was the dilemma of the
moment, Spingarn's officer-training camp, a project the chairman had
originated three months before the declaration of war and virtually
without consulting the board. General Wood, his Dutchess County
neighbor, had mentioned that the War Department might approve an
officers' camp if Spingarn could recruit a respectable number of
eligible African-American
candidates.[[83]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-83){#cha-83} Dismissing
the pacifist and integrationist qualms of fellow board members, Spingarn
had written pamphlets and taken to the lecture circuit to rally support
for a segregated military facility to be located in Des Moines,
Iowa---about as remote from the centers of African-American life as
could have been conceived. For the chairman, patriotism ranked with
civil rights as an unmitigated good. Villard's unwavering support of
neutrality struck Spingarn as irresponsible. He had even less patience
with Ovington's pacifism. The Socialist party's vote to oppose the war
in a special convention in St. Louis only days after Congress had
approved the president's request struck him as a folly verging on
treason. The Socialists Russell and Walling fully shared Spingarn's
consternation and would quit the party, as would the theorist John
Spargo, a Du Bois favorite, Upton Sinclair, and J. G. Phelps Stokes, an
extremely wealthy parlor Socialist and Tuskegee supporter. Once again,
the editor would decide to break with Debs, Ovington, and the party that
he continued to claim represented his political and social ideals.

When Spingarn began turning up on college campuses, the African-American
newspapers became increasingly hostile to his mission. Villard and
Ovington had contended that his personal crusade would inevitably drag
the NAACP into a controversy neither the board nor the membership had
formally debated, but their objections were grandly, disdainfully waved
aside. ""There is only one thing you can do at this juncture,"" the
chairman of the NAACP wrote in ""Educated Colored Men of the United
States,"" his widely circulated open letter, ""and that is to get the
training that will fit you to be officers, however and wherever this
training may be obtained."" At Howard University, George E. Brice, an
articulate, energetic student, stirred by the appeal, wrote Spingarn
that a speech to his fellow students would greatly advance the cause.
After an exchange of telegrams, and word of the Howard president's
approval, the chairman came to the campus on March 20. Dashing to other
colleges, Spingarn spoke to impressionable young men about the unique
opportunities available for service to country and race. Nash, the
uncertain executive secretary, was in Washington lobbying for the camp
on Capitol Hill and reporting regularly by letter and telegram to the
chairman on his
progress.[[84]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-84){#cha-84}

""I shall not feel hurt at any position you may take,"" Spingarn had
written Du Bois on February 20, just as the black press began to hiss.
His friend must appreciate that there was ""no other motive than to help
black men no less than white men."" Speaking not only for the Talented
Tenth but for perhaps a majority of African-Americans, the Chicago
[Defender]{.epub-i} and Baltimore [Afro-American]{.epub-i} made it clear
that this campaign was not the best means of helping black men. Even
though it was beyond contemplation that black officers could ever
command white troops, they argued that training alongside them, whether
or not the races ate and slept apart, was the [sine qua non]{.epub-i} of
a genuinely minted commission. The ""colored"" camp in the hinterlands
risked being a substandard undertaking, if not an outright fraud
corroborating the claims of Major Robert Shufeldt and other white
""authorities"" that military command was beyond the psychological and
intellectual capacities of the
race.[[85]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-85){#cha-85} Du Bois must
have wrestled with himself, for his writings had long ago indicated that
Du Bois the racial integrationist could coexist with Du Bois the racial
separatist. There was the chauvinist ""Conservation of the Races"" versus
the uncompromising integrationism of the Niagara ""Address to the
Country."" There was the skeptic who inveighed against those who ""speak
of human brotherhood as though it were the possibility of an already
dawning tomorrow."" There was the integrationist who demanded to know why
""cannot the nation that has absorbed ten million foreignersÂ ... absorb
ten million Negro
Americans...?""[[86]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-86){#cha-86}

By late March, he had allowed Spingarn to convince him that the
segregated camp in Iowa would advance the race. Harry Smith, militant
publisher of the Cleveland [Gazette,]{.epub-i} member of the NAACP's
Committee of One Hundred, and a friend, told Du Bois that the camp was a
major miscalculation. He argued by letter with Charles Young, now
commanding cavalry at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, who agonized over the
matter with him. ""Dr. Spingarn is right in practice, you see,"" Young
wrote, ""as you are right in theory. We are going to need leaders for the
Colored regiments."" Du Bois's protÃ©gÃ©, George Crawford, strongly
dissented, writing Spingarn that it was not, after all, ""foolishly
theoretical, but it is sometimes better to endure temporary
disadvantages than to yield a principle."" Richard R. Wright and the
affluent, aristocratic public servant George Cook were typical members
of the minority advocating the
camp.[[87]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-87){#cha-87} They believed
themselves not to be abjuring the principle of integration, but to be
laying firm ground for its future achievement by accepting a demeaning
expediency. Hope may have been similarly inclined, although
correspondence is silent on the matter.

In supporting Camp Des Moines, Du Bois tried to accommodate both his
chauvinism and his integrationism. By fighting for a democracy in which
too few Europeans and white Americans truly believed, the Africans of
the diaspora would quicken the collapse of European global hegemony and
the emergence of peoples of color. In a less romantic spirit, and more
in keeping with the class instincts of his Talented Tenth, Du Bois
envisaged black soldiers fighting and dying across Flanders fields, led
by Des Moines officers, as the high price of full citizenship in
America---civil rights through carnage. Yet it remained uncertain until
the last minute whether African-Americans would be excluded from the
military conscription legislation emerging from Congress. Conceivably,
white America, controlled by Wilson's Democrats, might go to war without
allowing black Americans the privilege of dying alongside it---as they
had in every war since the founding of the republic. In the racial and
political climate of the moment, then, Du Bois, whose own father had
worn the uniform, convinced himself that, given the opposition even to
black enlisted men, the commissioning of black officers in whatever
circumstances was imperative. He might well have eventually supported
the segregated-camp proposal anyway, but Spin-garn's influence
accelerated the decision. Gritting his teeth, he accepted the absurd
logic of having to fight ""even to be
segregated.""[[88]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-88){#cha-88}

Once decided, he plunged into the debate with typically fiery
conviction. ""We continually submit to segregated schools, 'Jim Crow'
cars, and isolation because it would be suicide to go uneducated, stay
at home, and live in the 'tenderloin,'"" he wrote in his April 1917
editorial berating the ""many hasty editors"" attacking Spingarn and the
camp. It was a ""perpetual dilemma,"" he conceded. But he had made the
sole possible choice, as his readers must, ""between the insult of a
separate camp and the irreparable injury of strengthening the present
custom of putting no black men in positions of authority."" Then, like
officers in training, the editor's argument advanced in quickstep:

[Our choice is as clear as noonday.]{.epub-i}

[Give us the camp.]{.epub-i}

[Let not 200, but 2,000, volunteer.]{.epub-i}

[We did not make the damnable dilemma.]{.epub-i}

[Our enemies made that.]{.epub-i}

[We must make the choice else we play into their very claws.]{.epub-i}

[It is a case of camp or no officers.]{.epub-i}

[Give us the officers.]{.epub-i}

[Give us the
camp.]{.epub-i}[[89]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-89){#cha-89}

Two months later, in ""Officers,"" Du Bois flayed Smith's
[Gazette]{.epub-i} for suggesting that he had been pressured into his
defense of the camp. But most readers knew that the editor really had
Trotter in mind. Incredulous at Du Bois's support of Spingarn, the
mugwump of civil rights had bluntly stated that Du Bois was ""a rank
quitter of the fight for our rights."" Now was the moment when
African-American leaders should dig in and demand, not conciliate
without even asking for concessions, he pleaded. Trotter pronounced a
searing verdict on Du Bois. He had ""at last finally weakened,
compromised, deserted the fight, betrayed the cause of his race.""
Dismissing such charges as muddle-headed, Du Bois was able to report a
last-minute development in the June editorial: ""We have won! The camp is
granted; we shall have 1,000 Negro officers in the United States Army!
Write us for
information.""[[90]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-90){#cha-90} What had
begun as a repugnant expediency became a shining triumph.

Opposition to Camp Des Moines continued among many of the old
Niagarites, and Archibald GrimkÃ© remained skeptical of Du Bois's
increasing enthusiasm for the war. Another node of opposition was [The
Messenger]{.epub-i} magazine, a politically robust and culturally
iconoclastic monthly just founded by Asa Randolph and Chandler Owen, two
young African-Americans who had recently joined the Socialist party,
from which Du Bois was now again distancing himself. ""Our aim,"" Randolph
and Owen boomed in the first [Messenger,]{.epub-i} ""is to appeal to
reason, to lift our pens above the cringing demagogy of the times and
above the cheap, peanut politics of the old, reactionary Negro
leadership""---by which they meant, among others, Du
Bois.[[91]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-91){#cha-91} But few
African-Americans yet paid attention to [The Messenger,]{.epub-i} and Du
Bois's [Crisis]{.epub-i} helped most of them to change their minds about
Camp Des Moines---at least to give the argument the benefit of their
doubts. His critics had expected him, understandably, to choose for
himself the role of magisterial flagellant, to inveigh against racist
policies imposed in a war for democracy, to heap imprecation on the
powers of bigotry, even if it led to [The Crisis]{.epub-i} being
suppressed under the new Espionage Act of June 1917. Yet, strangely, his
very powers as propagandist appear to have pushed him in the other
direction, as if to preclude the possibility that his renown might be
exploited in order to stigmatize African-Americans as whining, divisive,
unpatriotic. With German-Americans about to vanish as a visible and
vocal ethnic group and with pacifists prime candidates for lynching, the
radical Du Bois pivoted about to agree with Frederick Douglass's officer
son and Lieutenant Colonel Young---""When the storm is past, we can take
up the idealism of the
cause.""[[92]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-92){#cha-92}

Worrisome developments rapidly ensued, however. Charles Young's command
of a squadron of 10th Cavalry troops in Mexico had been the stuff of
legend. In sharp encounters costing the regiment the lives of twenty-two
men, Young, still a major, was ordered to lead his men in an advance,
pressing Pancho Villa's forces hard, and in two notable firefights, at
Aguascalientes (where American troops attacked for the first time under
protective machine gun fire) and at Santa Cruz de Villegas (where his
bugle charge dispersed six hundred [federates]{.epub-i} about to
obliterate an American squadron), Young earned from his white superior,
Colonel William C. Brown, the commendation ""excellent in all
categories."" That July, Black Jack Pershing himself presided over
Young's examination in the field, leading to his promotion to lieutenant
colonel. ""He was strong, fit, and only 49 years of age,"" Du Bois
cheered, ""and in the accelerated promotion of war-time would have been a
general in the army by
1918.""[[93]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-93){#cha-93}

The first clouds over Young's career gathered on March 31, the week
before the declaration of war. To the crucial question number 20 on his
efficiency report about general fitness to command, two of the examining
officers at Fort Huachuca remarked that Young was ""a very intelligent
colored officer, hampered with characteristic racial trait of losing his
head in sudden emergencies."" Simultaneously, a white Mississippian,
Lieutenant Albert B. Dockery, wrote his senator that his aversion to
service under Lieutenant Colonel Young had reached a possibly homicidal
point. Senator John Sharp Williams promptly communicated the
lieutenant's misery to the president of the United States. At that
moment, the army general staff was pressing the secretary of war for the
creation of a small, rudimentarily equipped, single black division.
Charles Young would have been the obvious choice to command such a
division, an eventuality that powerful elements within Congress and the
army intended to
prevent.[[94]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-94){#cha-94}

In the same month in which his editorial exulted, ""We have won! The camp
is granted,"" Du Bois received a long, anguished letter from Letter-man
General Hospital, San Francisco, where Young had been ordered to undergo
extensive medical tests by General Tasker H. Bliss, the chief of staff.
Was the lieutenant colonel's health so impaired by Bright's disease
(""chronic nephritis"") that continued active duty would be ""a menace to
the Army and to his own life,"" as the final medical hearing on July 7,
1917, determined? His medical records (which include an examination by
Young's personal civilian physician) indicate that elevated blood
pressure and albuminuria had been detected in 1910. It seems clear that
Young did have high blood pressure and that he managed to conceal the
fact from several examining boards. On the other hand, except for a
single recurrence in 1913 of blackwater fever contracted in Liberia, he
was never absent from duty and his overall performance was considered to
be ""excellent."" Medical officers had surprised their cavalry and
infantry colleagues by opposing their examining board's May 7
recommendation of Young as ""entirely fit for promotion"" to full colonel.
Woodrow Wilson was so well informed about the matter that he was able to
assure Senator Williams, who wanted action on Lieutenant Dockery's case,
that Young ""is not in perfectly good health"" and that a final
disposition of his case would occur within ""the next two or three
weeks.""[[95]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-95){#cha-95}

""No one in the regiment, either officer or man, believes me sick and no
one save the doctors here at this hospital,"" Young wrote Du Bois from
San Francisco on June 20. One of his nurses had said his case seemed a
joke, he continued. It was a joke---at the expense of the country.
""Without an ache or pain, here I sit twirling my thumbsÂ ... when I
should this minute be at Des Moines helping to beat those colored
officers into shape,"" he told Du Bois. ""It was a miserable ruse,"" Du
Bois protested.[[96]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-96){#cha-96} As a
member of the [New Republic]{.epub-i}'s editorial board, he alerted
Lippmann, hoping to enlist the magazine's support. The move to eliminate
Young generated a cyclone in the African-American press and a monsoon of
letters and telegrams to the White House. Despite the detailed report to
the army surgeon general on July 24, that Young suffered from advanced
nephritis and ""marked hypertrophy of the heart,"" Secretary Baker appears
to have decided initially on a waiver of the regulations. In the
interim, he instructed the general staff to hold Young's case ""in
suspense.""[[97]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-97){#cha-97} Villard,
still under the illusion that Wilson was willing to redeem something of
his pledge to African-Americans, had interceded with Baker and his young
assistant, Francis P. Keppel, extracting from Keppel a promise to alert
him before any final adverse actions were taken.

Baker was inclined to protect this unique symbol of minority excellence
for the good of the race's wartime morale. But the former reform mayor
of Cleveland reckoned without the obduracy of the military bureaucracy.
On July 27, army chief of staff Bliss informed him that, in the opinion
of the adjutant general, it would be impossible ""to promote any officers
junior to Colonel Young as long as the proceedings of the examining
board are not acted upon."" Three days later, the White House ordered
Young promoted to full colonel and retired from the active list. William
Garrison's grandson was annoyed with his Washington contacts. ""You gave
me your word,"" he upbraided Keppel. He was certain that there had been
""a miscarriage of justice; at least Young is the huskiest retired
officer I have ever
seen.""[[98]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-98){#cha-98} Young refused
to go quietly as expected, however. To prove his stamina, he rode
horseback from his National Guard command in Chillicothe, Ohio, to
Washington, cheered on by the black press. The White House managed to
avoid noticing the feat. At Du Bois's urging, Young was offered the
position of executive secretary of the NAACP, after Nash resigned to
assume an army commission and command of a black unit. Young expressed
interest, but typically imposed the condition that he could serve only
if unity and loyalty to the government took precedence over civil
rights.[[99]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter18-99){#cha-99} He soon took a
seat on the board.

B[ARRINGTON]{.epub-sc}

W[ILLIE DU BOIS]{.epub-sc}, as his family and the townspeople knew him,
was born on Church Street in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, on
February 23, 1868, a Sunday. On Saturday, the town had celebrated George
Washington's birthday. The birth certificate reads William E. Duboise,
""colored,"" issue of Alfred Duboise and Mary (no maiden name given),
whose February 5 nuptials in the nearby village of Housatonic the
previous year had been duly noted in the [Berkshire Courier.]{.epub-i}
The town clerk very likely spelled the father's name as he heard it
pronounced---[Dewboys]{.epub-i} rather than the Gallic
[Dew-Bwah.]{.epub-i} There is no way of knowing if Alfred Du Bois, whose
birthplace is given as San Domingo, Hayti, was the clerk's informant.
[Dewboys]{.epub-i} may have been what Alfred's people had found it
handiest to be called, as generations of them roved back and forth from
the Caribbean and through New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Like
Franklin Roosevelt, Leonard Bernstein, and other problematically named
Americans, Alfred's son would unfailingly insist upon the ""correct""
pronunciation of his surname. ""The pronunciation of my name is [Due
Boyss,]{.epub-i} with the accent on the last syllable,"" he would
patiently explain to the
uninformed.[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-1){#cha-1}

Most of what is known about these years comes from Du Bois himself,
whose compelling prose re-creations of the town, the times, the races,
and of his own family and himself are landmarks in American letters. He
was to leave his hometown at age seventeen, returning during the
following four-score years only infrequently, and always for brief
stays. Fifteen years after leaving, the village prodigy had transformed
himself, almost beyond recognition, into a cosmopolitan traveler and
distinguished scholar. But the importance of the Great Barrington
period, its imprint upon all that Willie Du Bois grew to be, was deep,
and certainly singular. His sense of identity or belonging was spun out
between the poles of two distinct racial groups---black and white---and
two dissimilar social classes---lower and upper---to form that double
consciousness of being he would famously describe at age thirty-five in
[The Souls of Black Folk.]{.epub-i} Because he sedulously invented,
molded, and masked this village world to suit his egocentric, if
inspired, purposes of personal and racial affirmation, a sojourn there
needs to be leisurely and probing enough to recover the Great Barrington
that its most famous citizen knew and yet did not wish to know or have
known. There were family matters of which he was deeply ashamed, others
that made him angrier than he could admit to himself. For Willie Du
Bois, the Berkshire period was variously Edenic fable, racial
definition, and psychic trapdoor.

Great Barrington is the last town of any size in the wedge of western
Massachusetts just before reaching the New York state line and the
Hudson River, twenty-four miles beyond. Albany is northwest, about
forty-five miles away. The town lies high and clear-aired in the dip of
two mountain ranges, the Berkshires to the east (one of them resembling
Mount Greylock, thirty miles to the north, the hump-backed inspiration
for Melville's [Moby-Dick]{.epub-i}), and the Taconic chain to the west
with nearby vaulting Mount Everett. For a few blocks, Great Barrington
nestles along the west bank of the Housatonic as it winds south out of
the Berkshire Valley across Connecticut, finally emptying into Long
Island Sound at Bridgeport. Berkshire historian Charles Taylor, one of
Willie's earliest mentors, discovered the first European mention of the
Housatonic when Major John Talcott's Connecticut troops ""pursued a party
of fugitive Indians into this region"" in August 1676, at the close of
King Philip's War, ""overtaking them on the banks of the Housatonic,
inflicting severe chastisement on them."" The site of that chastisement
was not far from the house where Willie was born. The Housatonic turns
up again in a 1694 entry in Reverend Benjamin Wadsworth's journal.
Accompanying the Massachusetts and Connecticut commissioners to a
pow-wow with the chiefs of the Iroquois Confederacy at Albany,
Wadsworth, a Bostonian and future president of Harvard College, records
his progress through a ""howling wilderness"" in which they took
""lodgings, about sundown, in ye woods, at a place called Ousetonuck,
formerly inhabited by Indians."" Two wars against the French, King
William's and Queen Anne's, more or less secured English claims below
Lake Ontario, including the Berkshire region, by the early eighteenth
century. On April 24, 1724, twenty Muhhekunnucks (as the European
chronicler called the local tribe) affixed X's at Westfield to a deed
conveying their lands along the Housatonic to one Colonel John Stoddard
and captains John Ashley, Henry Dwight, and Luke Hitchcock for 460
pounds of powder, 3 barrels of cider, and 30 quarts of
rum.[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-2){#cha-2}

But as Anglo-American Deweys, Ingersolls, Kelloggs, and Phelpses came to
claim and clear western Massachusetts, they found that the Hudson Valley
Dutch---Burghardts, Hollenbecks, and Van Deusens---were also arriving or
often already in place. Among the welter of documents generated by these
longstanding colonial disputes was the 1741 petition to the
Massachusetts General Court of one Coenraet Borghghardt for restitution
of the very same property Colonel Stoddard and his friends had acquired
from the Muhhekunnucks. The disputed acreage encompassed much of the
western part of the township that would be incorporated in 1761, without
a name, but soon to become known as Great
Barrington.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-3){#cha-3} By then, the
Dutchman and his family were among the undisputed proprietors on the
plain stretching west from Great Barrington across gentle Green River to
Egremont Village. This same Coenraet Borghghardt, Coonrad Borghardt, or
Conraed/Conrad Burghardt (the first of the Berkshire Burghardts) soon
came into possession of a slave boy named Tom, born in West Africa,
probably in the early 1730s, and sold by Dutch slavers in New York.
During four days in October 1780, Tom served as a private in Captain
John Spoor's company, whose regimental commander was a Colonel John
Ashley. The regiment mustered and hurried (too late) to lift the British
siege of forts Ann and George, for which service Tom probably won his
freedom. Tom Burghardt died in Great Barrington, about six years after
the cause for which he had apparently been willing, however briefly, to
give his life triumphed at the Battle of Yorktown. Nothing more is known
about him except that he had a wife (who may have also been born in West
Africa) and that there were begats aplenty from his
line.[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-4){#cha-4}

One son, Jacob or Jack, born about 1760, fathered at least six children,
one of whom, Othello, was Willie Du Bois's maternal grandfather. When
Captain Daniel Shays's indebted farmers and veterans, driven by hard
money and harsh courts to sedition, marched through the Housatonic
Valley on their way to seize the arsenal at Springfield in February
1787, Jack Burghardt may have played a small part in Great Barrington's
biggest drama of the century. Either he joined Shays's men or stood
solidly with the forces of order under Colonel John Ashley at Sheffield
(both of which incompatible distinctions his great-grandson claimed at
different times). Willie Du Bois also found a sketchy place for his
maternal great-grandfather in the War of
1812.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-5){#cha-5}

Handsome, free, and heir to a fair amount of good farmland near South
Egremont Village, Jack, after the death of his first wife, Violet,
became the young husband of Elizabeth Freeman sometime in early 1790. A
Berkshire woman of such exceptional achievements that she was to live
on, inspirationally, in Harriet Martineau's [Retrospect of Western
Travel,]{.epub-i} ""Mum Bett"" (as she was affectionately known to black
and white throughout the state) helped to deliver a mortal blow to
slavery in the Bay State, in 1783, by suing her abusive Sheffield
mistress, Colonel John Ashley's wife, and winning her freedom and thirty
shillings' damages before the county court in Great Barrington. Later,
when Shays and his rebels appeared at Stockbridge, Mum Bett hid her
employers' family silver and bluffed the men from the door. Her
watercolor portrait at the State Historical Society confirms Elizabeth
Freeman's legendary grit and intelligence, inviting conjecture about
what her life can have meant to the great-grandson by marriage who
mentions her proudly (""a rather celebrated figure"") in two
autobiographical works.[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-6){#cha-6}

As with much else to do with early Burghardt history, Du Bois has left
several confusing and contradictory accounts of the ""little black Bantu""
ancestor who sang a sad West African tune, still heard at the fireside
of his childhood:

Do bana coba, gene me, gene me!

Do bana coba, gene me, gene me!

Ben d'nuli, ben d'le.

Willie never learned the meaning of her song, the exact origin and
translation of which have continued to defy linguists. Perhaps the best
hypothesis suggests that it was a Wolof song from Senegambia about
confinement or captivity: ""[gene me, gene me]{.epub-i} \[gene ma, gene
ma\]!""---""get me out, get me out!"" In two remembrances of his Burghardt
kin---[Darkwater]{.epub-i} (1920) and the [Autobiography]{.epub-i}
(1968)---it is great-great-grandfather Tom's unnamed mate who ""clasped
her knees and rocked and crooned"" the African song. In [Dusk of
Dawn]{.epub-i} (1940), it is Jack's Violet, mother of the six surviving
Burghardts, who pines for
Africa.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-7){#cha-7} Violet seems a
more likely candidate, but it was the influence of the song, rather than
the singer, that finally mattered to Willie. It was his one truly
palpable tie to that African homeland he would spend an academic and
political lifetime trying to interpret and shape. ""Africa is, of course,
my fatherland,"" he would write sixteen years after spending a few months
during 1923 in Monrovia, Liberia. ""What is it between us that
constitutes a tie which I can feel better than I can
explain?""[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-8){#cha-8} Violet's song
had been the earliest prompting of a very New England and supremely
intellectual great-grandson to try to discern a few true notes of a
remote, vestigial, and mysterious heritage.

There were 3,920 people living in Great Barrington at the end of the
Civil War, three years before Du Bois was born. At least one of them, a
lanky lawyer named Joyner, admitted to being a Democrat. Two years
before Willie's birth, Congress had overridden Andrew Johnson's vetoes
in order to pass the first civil rights act and to establish the
Freedmen's Bureau, the first federal poverty program. In March 1867,
alarmed by the return to Congress of the very colonels who had so
recently stacked arms at Appomattox and who now protested paying off the
war debt at its face value in gold, and further outraged by Ku Klux Klan
violence and flagrant Black Codes reimposing slavery in the South in all
but name, the Republicans rushed through the first Reconstruction Act.
Ten southern states were placed under military rule until new state
constitutions, drafted with full participation by the former slaves,
were ratified along with the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, which
southern white legislators had just unwisely rejected. Five months after
Mary Silvina Burghardt Du Bois brought Willie into the world, the
lengthy Fourteenth Amendment was ratified by state constitutional
conventions throughout the South, with some 260 African-American
convention delegates voting, and incorporated into the Constitution of
the United States. Less than two years elapsed before ratification of
the Fifteenth Amendment, definitively guaranteeing the franchise to
black Americans. Until the experiment crafted by the ""radical""
Republicans expired as a result of racial hostility, scandal, economic
exploitation, and sectional rapprochement, the ""reconstructed"" South
would survive biracial state legislatures and even send two
African-American senators and twenty representatives to
Congress.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-9){#cha-9}

Western Massachusetts applauded what then seemed patent evidence of
Christian progress, racial uplift, and partisan political wisdom. Remote
as the citizens of Great Barrington were from the commencing potlatch of
the Gilded Age, the clangor of titanic industrial growth and raucous
political corruption nevertheless reached upward into the Berkshires as
muted, if distinct, echoes. Coming hard on the heels of the ""Whiskey
Ring"" scandal (bogus liquor-tax certificates) and the Credit Mobilier
(dummy railroad-construction companies) vacuuming of federal treasury
millions during Ulysses S. Grant's inattentive administration, the
disastrous Panic of 1873 seems to have rattled the business confidence
of more than a few of Great Barrington's citizens, and even Willie's
relatives felt the economic effects briefly. By and large, though, the
towns of western Massachusetts missed most of the turbulence of the
century's closing decades, and were content to have it so. But the
region was host to several cultural energies of singular power and
significance. Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote [The House of the Seven
Gables]{.epub-i} in nearby Lenox, and his friend Herman Melville created
[Moby-Dick]{.epub-i} outside the town of Pittsfield, where Oliver
Wendell Holmes spent summers with his
family.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-10){#cha-10} Great
Barrington would eventually come to boast about the years an
undistinguished young lawyer named William Cullen Bryant spent there.

Approaching the town from Stockbridge to the northeast, old U.S. 7
pretzels to the iron Great Bridge at the Housatonic, then straightens
and broadens past a cemetery into Main Street, unpaved until the end of
the century, and runs arrow-straight past yet another cemetery,
southwestward to Green River, and onto Egremont Plain. Great
Barrington's few thousands lived in summer under a canopy of elms over
Main Street and on streets that sloped east to the Housatonic River or
rose west and petered out in mountain trails. In the short daylight of
frozen winters, people found their way home by the glow of Main Street's
revolutionary naphtha lamps, installed in 1871 and among the first in
America. But until a special town meeting addressed the peril in the
mid-'80s, Jared Lewis grumbled in the [Berkshire Courier]{.epub-i} that
horses cantering to and from Main Street across the two iron bridges
often shied and plunged ""through the large openings at the sides."" Most
visitors were familiar with the town's outstanding feature, David
Leavitt's barn at Brookside---the largest barn in America when it was
completed in 1854. Horace Greeley had come to see it and its large
water-powered wheel for a story in the New York
[Tribune.]{.epub-i}[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-11){#cha-11}

The town was made of wood in the 1860s, except for St. James Episcopal
Church, haughty in its Romanesque blue limestone. The brick town hall
went up in 1876, along with the brownstone shaft monument to Great
Barrington's Civil War dead, the 251 officers and men of the 57th
Regiment, many of whom fell in the Battle of the Wilderness. Main
Street's First Congregational Church, where Willie Du Bois and his
relatives often worshipped, the [Berkshire Courier]{.epub-i} building,
Madame L'Hommedieu's millinery shop, Hollister's grocery store, the
bakery, and even the new National Mahaiwe Bank were wooden. In 1882, the
Congregational Church rose in blue limestone from its ashes, as did a
number of structures destroyed by fire that year. The fire of October
1892, a six-hour conflagration leaving nothing standing on either side
of Railroad Street, completed the transition from wood to brick and
stone. The place would still have been recognizable to William Cullen
Bryant, who combined the town clerkship with poetry until 1825, not
quite immortalizing Green River ""as it glides along/ Through its
beautiful banks in a trance of
song.""[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-12){#cha-12}

Great Barrington's sense of itself became somewhat self-consciously
Anglo-Saxon Protestant and Republican in the 1860s---Dutch families like
the Burghardts became Burgetts and joined the Episcopal faith---due to
the growing numbers of Irish Catholics and Czechoslovaks arriving to
work in the textile and paper mills in Housatonic Village, about four
miles north of the town. The Russell brothers, John and Asa, had
incorporated Monument Mills there in 1850, taking advantage of the
Housatonic's waterpower, as well as the eight-year-old Berkshire
Railroad line. In 1875, they added on a soaring bell tower and a
four-story brick building. When Willie Du Bois graduated from high
school ten years later, Monument Mills was the town's largest employer,
its 350 workers turning out 330,000 Marseilles quilts and 2,700,000
pounds of ""plain and fancy double twist cotton warps"" annually. A
history of the mill ranked it as ""by far the largest mill in South
Berkshire,"" although diminutive when compared to the textile juggernauts
of Lowell in the northeast and Adams in the northwest corner of the
state. Housatonic Village was also the home of Owen Paper Mill, the
second-largest employer. Van Deusenville, several miles away, turned out
pig iron.[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-13){#cha-13}

From Du Bois's recollections and a culling of town-hall records, a
reasonable estimate would fix the number of African-American families in
the region at less than thirty. Most were Burghardts, with a smattering
of Crawfords, Freemans, and Pipers, although a small influx of freed
slaves from the South was just beginning. A few of them, like the Thomas
Burghardt who worked for the Kellogg family, were substantial property
owners. With rare exception if any, Great Barrington's African-Americans
stayed away from the mills. Not only did industry-wide policy keep them
out, most of them did their best to affect the same superior attitude of
their white Protestant neighbors toward the Catholic newcomers who had
no choice but to work in the mills. Mill work was long, hard,
low-paying, and regimented. The old African-American families that
ventured out of farming preferred personal service, and, at least until
the 1870s, tended to have the pick of gentler jobs as domestics,
barbers, stewards, and coachmen. Dr. C. T. Collins had opened his hotel
in 1854, heralding the prosperous summer resort trade that was making
Great Barrington, along with Lee and Stockbridge, favored retreats of
New York and Connecticut's new leisure
classes.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-14){#cha-14}

Willie recalled ""several hotel cooks and waiters"" in the family who were
in charge of dining rooms, ""did well and were held in high esteem""---in
high esteem, perhaps, but not as equals. ""The color line was manifest,""
Willie has written, ""and yet not absolutely drawn."" Black and white
Great Barrington coexisted civilly, even affectionately, but the two
seldom commingled except on Sundays and in town meetings. And even when
African-American citizens were present, town meetings were, with rare
exception, the business of white men. The white churches, probably with
some shame and much haggling, were even beginning to encourage their
black parishioners to go elsewhere. By the late 1870s, although Willie
and some of his immediate family continued to worship in the
Congregational Church (previous generations had been Episcopalian), the
religious and social life of the black community found its pulse in the
little African Methodist Episcopal Zion (AME Zion) Church founded by
freedmen and women from the
South.[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-15){#cha-15}

There were actually three Great Barringtons, and the white newcomers
were pressing against the door of domestic service, a challenge coming
just as the Burghardt farms on Egremont Plain were less able to compete
with produce shipped by river and rail from great distances. Economic
historian Christopher Clark notes that Berkshire Valley ""dependence on
imported foodstuffs as well as other goods"" was well advanced by the
1870s. Three of Jack Burghardt's sons, Othello, Ira, and Harlow,
struggled along on the plain beyond Green River in neat houses set back
from the main road within easy walking distance of each other. Harlow
seems to have held on best. His property transactions in the town hall
Registry of Deeds show a fair amount of profit from land sales during
the period, including a December 19, 1868, transaction for eighty
dollars.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-16){#cha-16} Othello had
the least gumption, or so thought his demanding grandson. ""Uncle Tello,""
as Willie called his mother's father, was said to be too fond of the
medicine prescribed for a hip injury, and left much of the running of
things to his capable wife, Sarah or Sally, a handsome, tan woman from
Hillsdale, New York. The federal census tracks Othello Burghardt's
occupational vagaries decade by decade: 1850, whitewasher; and 1860,
laborer; until that for 1870 finds him with ""no occupation"" at eighty,
in a nimbus of pipe tobacco by the
fireside.[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-17){#cha-17}

But whether energetic or indolent, this black yeomanry was grappling
with large, impersonal forces, and as Great Barrington's established
white families began to prosper, its black ones, Willie Du Bois's among
them, were sliding into subsistence. The black families clung fiercely
to basic moral values---churchgoing, work, wedlock, and legitimate
births. ""The speech was an idiomatic New England tongue, with no African
dialect,"" Willie says. ""The family customs were New England, and the sex
mores."" None of them had gone much beyond learning the alphabet, and few
of them saw the need for more formal
education.[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-18){#cha-18} Hemmed in by
a racially exclusive industrialism, the whitening of domestic work, and
their own deep conservatism, they were like Uncle Tello, stuporous by
his fireside, atrophying, or, like cousin John Burghardt, determined not
to be licked and moving on. But if the rising tide of development
threatened some with drowning, in the crucial area of public education
it promised a lift for all those with enough motivation. Before Willie
Du Bois's first birthday, Great Barringtonians voted two thousand
dollars to create a public high school. Until then, only private
institutions like the Bostwick, Kellogg, Simmons, and Sedgwick schools
for the affluent offered training beyond the early
grades.[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-19){#cha-19} A plain,
rectangular building went up next to the old wooden elementary
schoolhouse in 1869, the town's second brick structure after the
Episcopal Church. It would be Willie Du Bois's salvation.

The real world Tom Burghardt's faltering descendants made for themselves
appears much transformed in the mythopoeic prose of Tom's illustrious
great-great-grandson. In those lyrical memoirs, whether [Darkwater, A
Pageant of Seven Decades, Dusk of Dawn,]{.epub-i} or the
[Autobiography,]{.epub-i} we are drawn to participate in a chronicle of
epic sweep, at once familial, racial, national, global, and prophetic.
Enchantingly, heroically, they employ the language of the saga. Each
alludes to the author's portentous birth ""by a golden river in the
shadow of two great hills, five years after the Emancipation
Proclamation."" The place of birth is idyllic and the circumstances
neither rich nor poor but suited in their modesty to the author's large
destiny. In local-color accents redolent of Washington Irving, Great
Barrington is fairly faithfully pictured as ""a little New England town
nestled shyly in its valley with something of Dutch cleanliness and
English reticence."" The house of his birth is ""quaint, with clapboards
running up and down, neatly trimmed."" There is a ""rosy front yard"" to
frolic in and ""unbelievably delicious strawberries in the rear.""
Elsewhere, we read of ""a rather nice little cottageÂ ... furnished with
some comfort.""[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-20){#cha-20}

Whereupon the chords of destiny begin to sound ever fuller. His ""own
people were part of a great clan."" ""These Burghardts lived on South
Egremont Plain for near 200 years."" The founding ancestor's relationship
to his master, Coenraet Borghghardt, is subtly altered. ""Sullen in his
slavery,"" Tom Burghardt had come through the western pass from the
Hudson ""[with]{.epub-i} his Dutch captor,"" rather than brought there
[by]{.epub-i} him. Tom's four days of service in Captain Spoor's company
becomes an enlistment ""to serve for three years"" in the War of
Independence.[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-21){#cha-21} By the
time of the [Autobiography,]{.epub-i} Tom's son Jack definitely decides
his place is with Daniel Shays against the forces of monopoly capital.
From Jack and Violet are born ""a mighty family, splendidly named: Harlow
and Ira, Chloe, Lucinda, Maria, and Othello!"" Du Bois's exclamation
point is like an arpeggio notation for successive chords about the
""ancestral home on Egremont Plain,"" that ""sturdy, small and
old-fashioned"" dwelling, ""the house of my grandfather Othello."" Here,
ten more shoots of the mighty family burst forth from broken-hipped
Othello and the once-attractive Sally, now ""thin, yellow, and
hawk-faced""---one of them, Mary Silvina, Willie Du Bois's mother,
sometime in 1831. Hers is a dulcet movement: ""Mother was dark shining
bronze, with smooth skin and lovely eyes; there was a tiny ripple in her
black hair; and she had a heavy, kind
face.""[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-22){#cha-22} In the surviving
photograph, she is an erect, dark-skinned woman with sad eyes, a strong
chin, and rather voluptuous lips.

Where and how Mary Silvina met Alfred Du Bois elude the historian and
genealogist, at least for the present. Alfred may have made his way to
Great Barrington in 1867, ""small and beautiful of face and feature, just
tinted with the sun, his wavy hair chiefly revealing his kinship to
Africa."" His people were free people of color, descended from Dr. James
Du Bois of Poughkeepsie, New York, a wealthy physician of French
Huguenot origins. James Du Bois's family had chosen the cause of George
III over that of George Washington, receiving as reward from the British
crown extensive lands in the Bahamas. A few years later, the Du Boises
and their cousins, the Gilberts, had spread their plantation holdings to
Haiti. On the island of Long Cay in the Bahamas, James sired at least
three sons and a daughter of his slave mistresses. He took two of the
children, probably the lightest in complexion, Alexander and John, with
him when he returned to New York about 1812, enrolling them in
Connecticut's exclusive Cheshire School for Boys. James Du Bois died,
unexpectedly, not long afterward, and his Creole sons found themselves
disowned by their white relatives and forced to give up boarding school
for skilled labor. John resigned himself to his marginal lot, dying in
December 1830 in his late twenties in Fair Haven, Connecticut. Alexander
was apprenticed to a shoemaker but bolted to become a small merchant in
New Haven. Marrying there in 1823, he and Sarah Marsh Lewis had several
children by 1830, only one of whom, Augusta, survived into
adulthood.[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-23){#cha-23}

The enigmatic Alfred Du Bois was born in Haiti, where Alexander had gone
alone to try to salvage what he could of a once considerable patrimony,
no later than 1833. When Alexander returned to the United States soon
after Alfred's birth, he left the boy and his mother behind. Whether
estranged or not, he and Sarah in New Haven were still legally married;
Alexander understandably elected to come back to the city and his
tobacco shop without Haitian dependents. When and how Alfred left Haiti
remains conjectural, but by the time he appears in the 1860 census he
may have been plying the trades of barber and cook or waiter in upstate
New York for several years. Perhaps, as Willie speculates, his father
came through the western pass from New York to try his luck in the
valley of the Housatonic. An adoring son deploys Homeric imagery for the
roving young god's advent, announcing that, ""Alfred, my father, must
have seemed a splendid vision in that little valley under the shelter of
those mighty hills.""[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-24){#cha-24}
Yet Willie almost surely came to suspect years later that his father was
something more than a well-meaning, romantic rakehell, ""indolent, kind,
unreliable,"" who came and soon departed from the valley and his family,
only to die shortly
thereafter.[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-25){#cha-25}

The suspicion is unavoidable that he knew more, if only subconsciously,
considering the number of factual inconsistencies, surprising in a
historian, as well as the nervousness apparent in some of the writing.
Had Alfred been married before he took Mary Silvina to live ""by the
golden river""? In [Dusk of Dawn,]{.epub-i} Du Bois ""imagined not,"" and
in the [Autobiography]{.epub-i} denies even the ""hint"" of it,
speculations absent from the earlier [Darkwater.]{.epub-i} Although
Alfred certainly never marched with the splendid black Massachusetts
54th Infantry Regiment during the Civil War, as some have supposed, he
wears a private's uniform in his sole extant, undated photograph. The
five-feet-six sloe-eyed soldier looks from under a dented kepi somewhat
vacantly into the camera, his elbow-length cape mushrooming around
narrow shoulders. Had he truly enlisted somewhere (possibly as a white
man), the son wondered, and, if so, what had he done? Willie abandons
the puzzle with an uncharacteristic shrug, deciding that the dazzling
""Alfred never actually did much of anything."" But what happened to
Alfred after 1869 or early 1870? Although Willie was not then even two
years old, somehow he writes later of ""last remember\[ing\] urgent
letters for us to come to New Milford,"" Connecticut. Yet if Alfred died
as a barber or a preacher somewhere in Connecticut soon thereafter, as
his son says in several places, then the final words about Alfred in the
[Autobiography]{.epub-i} are surprisingly inconsistent: ""I never saw
him, and know not where or when he
died.""[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-26){#cha-26}

In fact, as probate court documents in Bristol County, Massachusetts,
disclose, Alfred Du Bois was almost certainly alive in Meriden,
Connecticut, as late as 1887, which is hardly surprising, considering
the eighty-four years enjoyed by his own father, Alexander, and the
ninety-five allotted to his son, Willie. Whether or not Alfred married
again and had offspring in New Milford or Meriden is unknown, but it is
virtually certain that he committed bigamy when he and Mary Silvina
Burghardt presented themselves to be married by Reverend Amos E.
Lawrence in February 1867. At various times from 1858 through 1862, he
was a baker, barber, and waiter in Albany, New York, giving the federal
census taker his age as twenty-eight in 1860, and that of his presumed
wife, Hannah, as twenty-one. Their household also contained a white
woman named Catherina Dillman, ""servant,"" age twenty, probably a paying
boarder or possibly even part of a mÃ©nage Ã  trois. Two years later,
before disappearing permanently from the city directory, Alfred Du Bois
was a waiter at the exclusive Delavan House, site of the titanic Erie
Railroad battle five years later among Commodore Vanderbilt, Daniel
Drew, and Jay Gould.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-27){#cha-27}

""Gay and carefree,"" in the son's debonair description, ""refusing to
settle long at any one place or job,"" Alfred eventually left Hannah, who
is last seen struggling on alone as a washerwoman in the 1866 Albany
directory.[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-28){#cha-28} By then, he
had also deserted from his Civil War unit, Company D, 20th Regiment,
United States Colored Troops (New York). Having signed up at Amenia, New
York, for a three-year term, he mustered in at Poughkeepsie on January
23, 1864. Private Alfred Du Bois gave his age as thirty and Connecticut,
rather than Haiti, as his birthplace. Although his son would have been
surprised to learn of actual service with Union forces at Port Hudson,
Louisiana, Alfred's record was predictably feckless. The Records of the
Adjutant General of the United States reveal the unimpressive truth.
Laid up in Port Hudson General Hospital with bouts of diarrhea and
dysentery in early April, then assigned there as a medical attendant
after recovering, he was listed as absent without leave in August after
being ordered to rejoin his regiment. On February 7, 1865, Alfred was
""dropped as a deserter,"" eight weeks before
Appomattox.[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-29){#cha-29} For some
reason, Willie gave his father's age as forty-two when he appeared in
Great Barrington, although the town-hall registry makes him, as well as
his bride, only thirty-four. Mary Silvina would actually have been
nearer thirty-six, if her son and her death certificate are correct.
Alfred would have been no more than thirty-seven, and probably a year or
so younger, having been born after 1831. The son's mistake could explain
his readiness to believe that Alfred had died in the early
1870s.[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-30){#cha-30}

With his indeterminate color and Franco-Haitian background, a moral
chameleon like Alfred would have found the hothouse atmosphere of
occupied New Orleans full of potential. Maybe a stint as a physician
(only a step up from barbering then), perhaps the bagging of a rich
widow (the war had made many), or, possibly, scheming to make himself
useful to the city's rising mulatto politicians detained him for a time.
Equally likely, he may have returned to wander over the familiar terrain
of upstate New York on the lookout for a grubstake. No evidence having
been found to substantiate any of these plausible speculations, this is
an opportune point to return, amid these speculations, to the where and
how of Alfred and Mary's meeting. As crucial as she is to Willie Du
Bois's life, Mary Silvina is never more than a shaded figure, hovering,
always approaching, but never to be beheld in the high noon of abundant
evidence. ""She gave one the impression of infinite patience,"" her son
recalled almost eighty years after her death, ""but a curious
determination was concealed in her softness."" Rebelliousness, perhaps,
more than
determination?[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-31){#cha-31}

His mother had not always been the reticent homebody Willie remembered.
He recalled dimly that she may have gone to New York City once, but he
left that intriguing possibility
unexplored.[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-32){#cha-32} Again,
however, as with his father, Willie may very well have heard
things---family gossip, rumors among the townspeople, or, perhaps,
simply intuited meanings from what went unsaid---to suspect that his
mother had lived a fuller, more complicated life in her youth. She had
transgressed Burghardt family tradition in the most fundamental way.
Modest farmers and semiskilled laborers, proud people who clung to
respectability even as fate pushed them toward the margin, the black
Burghardts had been New England to the core in culture and values.
""There was only one illegitimate child throughout the family in my
grandfather's and the two succeeding generations,"" Willie would boast.
But that one exception was Mary Silvina herself, whose firstborn,
Adelbert, the family claimed to be the issue of a ""romance"" with John
Burghardt, a first cousin---a ""love affair"" broken up ""on account of
consanguinity.""[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-33){#cha-33}
Adelbert was the half brother about whom Willie was never quite able to
write comfortably---or even correctly, consistently rendering his name
as Idelbert. The fact that Adelbert's illegitimate birth in 1862 is
unreported either at Great Barrington or South Egremont Village town
halls suggests that Mary Silvina had left home. There is no Mary in
Othello's household on the 1860 census for Great Barrington. Nor is she
reported there on the 1865 interim census, although Adelbert, listed as
three years old, is.[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-34){#cha-34}

Adelbert Burghardt himself could of course have thrown light on the
circumstances of his birth, as well as something of his mother's
character. It seems certain that his younger brother, an investigator
[sans pareil]{.epub-i} in other matters, somehow never made sufficient
effort to learn everything he could. Adelbert's real father was not
likely to have been John Burghardt, a dentist in the town. That the
affair with the cousin was a probable fabrication appears to be
confirmed by Adelbert, who insisted that he was born in Connecticut and
later that his father was a man named Charles Craigg or Craig. A black
man named Charles Craig worked in the home of Artemis and Judith
Bigelow, wealthy white citizens of Great Barrington. Craig, who must
have come to the town after 1860, would have been forty-one or forty-two
when Adelbert was born. The 1870 census lists his profession as
coachman, the line of work Du Bois's older brother would
follow.[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-35){#cha-35} The ""rather
silent"" Mary Silvina, then, could, and probably did, tell her younger
son much about the promise and peril of worlds beyond settled and tidy
Great Barrington.

She had wrenched free of Burghardt provincialism in her late teens, very
likely defying family commands to fit into the grooved drudgery of
low-paying domestic work and a humdrum labor pact that too often passed
for marriage among the people she knew. The new Housatonic mills where
she could have earned a little more money and had weekends free were
closed to her because of race and tradition. Mary Silvina had enough
intelligence and initiative, and maybe enough of the double-edged
imagination that drove an increasing number of working-class women, to
risk all---virtue, family, and health---on the main chance of the
cities. If she ever saw New York City, as Willie believed, she may not
have worked there for any length of time; more likely she was hired for
kitchen work in large hotels in the towns along the upper Hudson and the
Connecticut portion of the Housatonic. Salesclerking, the toniest
occupation available to women of Mary Silvina's class and
skills---native-born ""American girls"" who spoke pure English---was for
whites only. There should also have been stints as a maid in private
homes.

Clearly, she was a woman with a past that proper New England townspeople
would have called, if not scarlet, certainly pink. She would have been
no stranger to dance halls or amusement parks, permissive places young
working women flocked to, indulging in styles of dress and sexual mores
decades ahead of anything yet imagined in their hometowns. The
possibility exists, of course, that, in reaction to her early
experiences, Mary Silvina's sober, sensitive Great Barrington
personality bore scant resemblance to the woman known to her peers in
New York and Connecticut. It is more reasonable to believe, however,
that the two women were intimately related---that Willie's mother was
never a wild or wanton person. A certain sensitivity is hinted at in the
name Adelbert. There is her deep aversion to alcohol, no doubt grounded
in too many observations of painful drunkenness. By the time she met
Alfred, probably somewhere in upstate New York, she was in her
mid-thirties and compromised, although far from being a creature
pummelled in the way of other poor working women, white and black, whom
industrializing America was degrading in ever-larger
numbers.[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter2-36){#cha-36} Living on the
edge of a working woman's urban abyss, but coming early and leaving
before too late, she narrowly escaped the classic fate of Stephen
Crane's [Maggie: A Girl of the Streets]{.epub-i} or Theodore Dreiser's
[Sister Carrie.]{.epub-i} Alfred Du Bois was not the stunning cavalier
described by his son, but to Mary Silvina, in her circumstances and
given her yearnings, this short, debonair, ""light mulatto"" war veteran
with the French surname and the rarefied pedigree must have seemed a
unique catch.

[[LEHRJAHRE]{.epub-sc}]{.epub-i}

[W. E. BURGHARDT]{.epub-sc} Du Bois's ambitions and John F. Slater's
money intersected at a point in American history roughly equidistant
between the espousal by the ruling classes of a fading creed of
Christian uplift and their heartfelt embrace of a social gospel based on
greed. Slater, of Norwich, Connecticut, knew that his splendid success
in business owed as much to cheap cotton as to the Lord's benevolence.
So that the least of God's creatures might also aspire to better
themselves, he set aside the imposing sum of \$1 million in 1882 for
""uplifting the lately emancipated population of the Southern states and
their posterity, by conferring on them the blessings of Christian
education."" His was the second of the great early philanthropies whose
significant or principal concern was the education of the former slaves
and their descendants. Between 1867 and 1869, the even more pious
Episcopal financier George Foster Peabody, of New York and London,
endowed a fund bearing his name with more than \$2 million for
""intellectual, moral, or industrial education"" in the ""more destitute
portions of the Southern and Southwestern
states.""[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-1){#cha-1}

Although there was rich potential in its human capital, the South would
have to educate its people first in order to make optimal use of that
capital. This was a staggering challenge to a hierarchical social order
whose prosperity before the Civil War had been made to depend upon an
illiterate black labor force and a white yeomanry only barely able to
read its Bibles. African slavery had made the antebellum South a unique
social, political, and economic form of capitalism in North America and
Europe. The consequences of tenant agriculture, single-crop economy, and
racial segregation continued to make the region unique and too poor to
pay its own way into the postwar world of industry, political democracy,
social services, and public education. Consequently, southern white
leaders looked upon the education of their people as no more achievable
than the Second Coming, and about as imminent. And, whether possible or
not, they asked themselves if it was even desirable. It was a bedeviling
quandary for the Bourbon rulers of the Redeemed South---redeemed from
""Negro rule""---as to how much education the poor white people should
have. The ideal minimum of instruction to be risked on the former slaves
was an even greater dilemma. ""Education has but one tendency: to give
higher hopes and aspirations,"" a North Carolina newspaper warned. ""We
want the negro to remain here, just about as he is---with mighty little
change.""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-2){#cha-2}

But whatever the eventual answers to such sensitive, vexatious
questions, would the tax rates ever be anywhere near adequate? Alabama,
as a typical case, devoted nearly 50 percent of its state budget to
public education during the 1890s, which only amounted to a lamentable
\$4.50 per year per pupil. The average annual per-pupil expenditure in
the South during the 1890s was less than two dollars. In the North it
was almost twenty. But if the North-South gap in public expenditures was
great, a comparable gap grew with each passing year between public money
spent for the education of white and black children below the
Mason-Dixon Line. By 1900, the average was twice as much for white
children, and in the following decade the disparity would widen cruelly.
The Peabody and Slater funds, along with the Daniel Hand Fund, the
Southern Education Board (SEB), the Anna T. Jeanes Fund, and others soon
called into existence by the desperate state of affairs, found
themselves disbursing thousands of dollars each year to train teachers
and prop up public schools. Christian noblesse not unmixed with guilt
created these benefactions; but the kingdom of mammon was never far from
sight. The distant but paramount goal was a literate labor force
adjusted to the rhythm and discipline of modernizing agriculture and
industry, which the business associates of the Peabodys and Slaters
hoped to bring to the
South.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-3){#cha-3}

After the late 1880s, these philanthropies in effect assumed what should
have been the last-resort role of the federal government. Like an
incandescent bulb at its brightest before dying, the Republican
administration of Benjamin Harrison had flashed federal attention upon
the South's special problems, lighting up the plight of the Negro in
particular. ""When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which
have so long been his in law?"" asked the president in his first annual
message to Congress in 1889. Responding to their leader, as well as to
what survived of the finer ideals of the Grand Old Party, Senator Henry
W. Blair of New Hampshire and young Representative Henry Cabot Lodge of
Massachusetts introduced legislation in early 1890 that threatened (or
so it seemed) the new racial understanding between white North and white
South. Eloquent, learned even, Blair was the Senate's authority on
education. His bill (approved twice before in the Senate) provided for
eight years of federal subsidies to states where the percentage of
illiterates was unusually high in comparison to the national norm.
Federal funding would come from the surplus generated by the high
Republican tariff on imports.

Although the Blair Education Bill realistically bowed to the South's
segregated educational system, it caused considerable offense by
requiring state governors to certify annually to the secretary of the
interior that no racial discrimination existed in the expenditure of
monies for public education. Still, as one fifth of the region's white
school-age children was unable to read and write, more southern
politicians than not favored the bill. The time had not yet come when it
was suicidal for white officials to endorse gains for African-Americans
in order to add to those already benefiting their own people. The Blair
Bill met its final death in 1890 primarily due to the pact between
northern Republicans, who were opposed to federal dollars going to
southern illiterates, and midwestern farmers and southern populists for
whom the high tariff was
anathema.[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-4){#cha-4} Lobbed into the
House later that year, Lodge's so-called Force Bill included the threat
of federal supervision of elections whenever a prescribed percentage of
local voters petitioned Washington. Cynics who claimed to have suspected
all along a ploy by Republican business and financial interests to
blackmail the farming South into a deal for a factory-protecting tariff
were not surprised to see Lodge's bill, barely voted through in the
House, expire the following January in Senate horsetrading among
high-tariff easterners, ""home rule"" southerners, and cheap-money
westerners.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-5){#cha-5}

With these reverses, the afterglow of abolitionism and Reconstruction
was to be extinguished in Washington for more than fifty years. Whatever
tremors reached Du Bois at Harvard, he cannot really have felt at that
moment the shifting regional and racial plates deep beneath the surface
of the nation's political culture, catastrophic realignments that would
soon flatten the futures of many millions of African descent and make
even of him a near-casualty. Such was his high Tory sense of civil
rights, in fact, that he saw no need for the Lodge Bill, writing
serenely to Fortune's New York [Age]{.epub-i} that ""when you have the
right sort of black voters, you will need no election laws. The battle
of my people must be a moral one, not a legal or physical one."" Although
Booker T. Washington was beginning to voice such sentiments from the
rostrum, Carlyle was far more likely to have been Du Bois's civics
preceptor at the time. In any case, the twenty-two-year-old graduate
student's views were in accord with the new order in race relations that
was hurriedly being codified and implemented throughout the South, lest
some new political agenda above the Mason-Dixon Line inaugurate another
rash of meddling bills or even awaken the Supreme Court to a democratic
construing of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Mississippi took
the lead, even as Congress was heatedly debating the federal education
and election legislation. Meeting in Jackson in a constitutional
convention in mid-August 1890, 130-odd white Democrats and planter
Isaiah T. Montgomery of all-black Mound Bayou Township, lone survivor of
what had once been a significant political presence, voted in the
""Mississippi Plan."" A two-dollar poll tax, a literacy test,
disqualification for petty crimes, and duty to recite from memory and
interpret upon request the clauses in the new state constitution
effectively disfranchised all but a handful of African-Americans and
several thousand poor white people as
well.[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-6){#cha-6}

This was the fast-developing reality when Du Bois's application reached
Slater Fund president Rutherford B. Hayes---an application supported, Du
Bois said, with letters ""from every person I knew in the Harvard Yard
and places outside."" Despite his claim to have become thoroughly and
irrevocably ""a Negro"" at Fisk, in the fall of 1890 when he mailed his
first Slater Fund letters, Du Bois clearly thought of himself both as
the embodiment of his race as well as something ambiguously
superordinate. ""I omitted stating that I am, in blood, about one half or
more Negro, and the rest French and Dutch,"" the April 1891 postscript to
his second letter read. ""I wish to lay my case before you,"" Du Bois
stated crisply.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-7){#cha-7} Surely he
had no idea that, in the estimation of the former U. S. president, the
Slater Fund was obliged to subordinate the merits of his application to
weighty issues of national policy on race relations. Those weighty
issues were to be reviewed at two of the most fateful gatherings ever
assembled to thrash out the ""Negro Problem,"" the first and second Mohonk
Conferences on the Negro Question, deliberating in upstate New York
during the first week in June of 1890 and 1891. Hayes, whose idea they
were (seven previous Lake Mohonk conferences had focused on the American
Indian), presided.[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-8){#cha-8}

Among the throng of concerned men and women accommodated in the Smiley
brothers' rambling hotel with its manicured lawns planing to the lake
were some of America's most influential educators and molders of
opinion. They were exclusively white, Protestant, and, in the main,
male, and, some of them, opulently hypocritical. The education of ""that
other weaker race""---""our brothers in black,"" said Hayes, quoting the
South's leading paternalist, Methodist Bishop Atticus Haygood of
Atlanta, as he opened the 1890 conclave---was the urgent matter of the
hour. Unfortunately, Hayes conceded, ""the recent adverse action of the
Senate admonishes us, that we may no longer look with confidence for
government aid."" Responsibility for the southern Negro now devolved upon
the men and women at Mohonk. ""Having deprived them of their labor,
liberty, and manhood, and grown rich and strong while doing it,"" the
dismantler of Reconstruction admitted, ""we have no excuse for neglecting
them.""[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-9){#cha-9}

A minority of the Mohonkers attending the first conference had arrived,
like the grandson of John Jay, with a presumption that what
African-Americans mainly needed was plenty of general education, not
special education different in nature from that administered to whites.
That was how Miss Elizabeth Botume saw the matter, speaking with emotion
of her days at war's end among the freedmen and freedwomen at Port
Royal, South Carolina. Yet the absence of one of the white South's most
knowledgeable and honest authorities on race relations was ominous.
Ex-Confederate cavalryman and novelist of Creole Louisiana George
Washington Cable not only boycotted Mohonk on the grounds that the
conference was designed to reach a predetermined agreement about higher
education for the Negro, the author of [The Silent South]{.epub-i} also
alerted Booker T. Washington and other race leaders of the conspiracy.
Washington answered Cable's warning letter by confessing that he had
""thought it a little strange that no invitation came to me,"" adding
(mistakenly) that ""the exclusion of colored men will in large degree
cripple the influence"" of any recommendations issued by the
conference.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-10){#cha-10} William
Sanders Scarborough, the learned African-American professor of classics
at Afro-America's first college, Wilberforce University, protested the
exclusion in the widely circulated [Arena]{.epub-i} magazine, charging
that there was ""a great deal of insincerity on the part of many
so-called advocates of the race."" Any who doubted the reasonableness of
Scarborough's suspicions had only to hear the explanation offered by the
lordly Congregationalist divine, Lyman Abbot: ""A patient is not invited
to the consultation of the doctors on his
case.""[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-11){#cha-11}

By the time the second Mohonk Conference assembled, the old optimism of
Yankee schoolmarms and Union officers-turned-professors in AMA
""universities"" was dismissed as a harmful extravagance. Those waning
voices that still appealed for broad training and social justice for the
Negro were met with increasing impatience at Mohonk. Albion Tourgee,
carpetbagger, folklorist, and jurist; Malcolm MacVicar, New York bishop
and Baptist Home Mission Society secretary of education; William Torrey
Harris, U.S. commissioner of education; and several others were opposed
by educational ""realists"" like Merrill E. Gates of Rutgers, Andrew
Dickson White of Cornell, Oliver Otis Howard of Howard, and, above all,
by Hampton Institute's founder and redoubtable drillmaster of colored
peoples, General Samuel Chapman Armstrong. Commissioner Harris and
Reverend MacVicar protested that the best races were those receiving the
best education. The African-American was, ""in every sense that you and I
claim to be, a man,"" cried MacVicar. Judge Tourgee, speaking as a
northerner with first-hand knowledge of the Negro in the South, flayed
as hypocrites those whose very fortunes were built upon the supposed
shiftlessness of black people. Tourgee momentarily stirred the
conscience of the assembly by declaring that this reviled people had
""accomplished more in twenty-five yearsÂ ... than any people on the face
of the earth ever before achieved."" Far more, he said, ""than the 'poor
whites' of the South, the landless cropper-class."" A professor from
Charlotte, North Carolina, rose to suggest ""when we speak of industrial
education, we should emphasize the word
'education.'""[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-12){#cha-12}

Moved but unpersuaded, the Mohonkers were brought back to earth by
Cornell president White's practiced pose of objectivity. The recent past
was riven by injustices, yet history could not be rewritten. The South
must be allowed to solve its race problem as it saw best, White pleaded,
even at the constitutional price of disfranchising millions of its
citizens. Lyman Abbott, pastor of Brooklyn's venerable Plymouth Church,
the ruling voice of Congregationalism and editor of what was shortly to
become the influential [Outlook,]{.epub-i} shared his considerable
knowledge of the race problem at the Second Mohonk Conference. After a
recent visit to North Carolina where he had ""studied it for two days and
a half,"" Abbott assured the doubters that ""taking the South as a
wholeÂ ... prejudices are disappearing and a sincere, earnest desire for
the very best and largest education of the colored people is coming.""
Had not Reverend R. H. Allen, D.D., secretary of the Presbyterian Board,
and several other reconstructed slaveholding southerners, testified with
evangelical zeal and anecdotal felicity to the newfound racial
understanding in the South? ""History affords no instance in which one
race has redeemed another race,"" Abbott
admonished.[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-13){#cha-13}

Underlying their indecision and their subsequent retreat from the
educational model they themselves---and hosts of relatives---had carried
messianically to the South was a much larger reservation in the minds of
Mohonkers. The national philosophy of education had been under review
and revision for more than two decades. Practical training, vocational
instruction, industrial education---there were a number of terms for
it---was praised by a swelling chorus as the right way to nurture the
minds of the great majority of Americans. Educators carefully read the
writings of Johann Pestalozzi, Philipp von Fellenberg, and Friedrich
Froebel, the European philosophers whose advocacy of industrial and
vocational education had become a conquering ideology in post-Civil War
America. It was said that the dawning Machine Age called for a
quick-response citizenry with intelligences unfettered by antiquarian
and nonutilitarian knowledge. To the genuinely progressive advocates,
the new theories meant breaking out of stodgy instruction based on
abstractions, rote memory, useless languages, and hoary fables; it
anticipated the emphasis on spontaneity and learning-by-doing that
informed the coming instrumentalism and progressive education reforms of
John Dewey and his
followers.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-14){#cha-14} To many
others---the more conservative faction---the new philosophy held the key
to the social control of working-class men and women, the construction
of an educational regime designed to equip them with the technical
competency necessary to function obediently and narrowly in the new
industrial order. Vocational and industrial training would act as a
safety valve in a turbulent democracy. Many of them saw the German
technical high schools as the model to emulate.

The application of vocational education to the African-American was
cause for great excitement and even more mischief. Again, the genuinely
progressive---the nonpaternalists---saw it as a breakthrough, an
affordable, academically sufficient, and economically productive
solution to the South's intractable problems. As originally conceived,
therefore, vocationalism was not a bogus substitute to be foisted on
black people but an education as appropriate for them as for most white
people. But there were other theorists, public figures, and politicians
who looked upon vocationalism as a way to avoid an increasingly resented
and vexing burden. This new thinking about educating African-Americans
naturally appealed to them, and for them, the laboratory at Hampton
Institute in Virginia had demonstrated that the experiment could work
perfectly without any threat to the South's socioeconomic order.
Ex-Confederate general and New South railroad magnate Thomas Muldrop
Logan had seen that clearly some fifteen years before the two
conferences at Lake Mohonk, reassuring his Richmond business colleagues
that after African-Americans had been trained to perform ""efficiently
their part in the social economy, his \[sic\] caste allotment of social
duties might prove advantageous to southern society, as a whole, on the
principle of a division of labor applied to
races.""[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-15){#cha-15}

At the Mohonk conferences, then, a new and dubious educational paradigm
edged out an idealistic old one. Having commanded African-American
soldiers in the Civil War, and now training their sons and daughters in
tidewater Virginia, Samuel Armstrong was hailed as an oracle.
Hawaiian-born, sternly handsome, he was one of the leaders of industrial
education in the country, the most persuasive exponent of the Froebelian
ideal of harmonious development of ""head, heart, and hand."" With Yankee
grit he had founded and structured Hampton Normal and Agricultural
Institute in 1868 so that Negroes and Indians could learn the lessons of
humility, cleanliness, thrift, and, above all, the love of the white
race that his prize pupil Booker T. Washington was about to exemplify to
a reassured world. ""Labor is a great moral and educational force,"" the
general observed on the first morning of the first conference. ""The
Negroes are a laboring people."" Slavery had diminished the value of
work, unfortunately, because, like the American Indians,
African-Americans had ""had it forced upon them."" ""The great thing"" was
to give them ""an idea of the dignity of labor, that is to change their
standpoint,"" as Armstrong had done at Hampton. Resting his case in a
peroration of Victorian cant---""The Negro is back in the iron age; the
white race is in its golden age; and idleness is equally the curse of
both""---the general regained his seat to thunderous
applause.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-16){#cha-16}

In the end, the Mohonkers came to agree that facilities for industrial
education were to be increased in the South, ""not only in the trades,""
as Resolution One announced, ""but especially in improved agriculture,
and for the girls in household duties that \[are\] fit for home-making
and housekeeping."" Resolution Three conceded the principle of higher
education ""open to the most capable Negroes,"" but no one left Lake
Mohonk in doubt as to the new emphasis upon rudimentary education ""of
heart and hand,"" intended to turn out subservient farmers, cooks,
seamstresses, maids, carpenters, and masons. Having ceded their
franchise to the white South, the spirit of Mohonk began the surrender
of the best educational future of
African-Americans.[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-17){#cha-17}

These and similar impending developments were in the air when Rutherford
Hayes eventually replied to Du Bois at the beginning of May 1891. By
then, the Slater Fund files contained letters from other ambitious,
well-educated young men of color, or their white sponsors, inquiring
about the widely publicized fellowship Hayes had promised at Johns
Hopkins. With the Second Mohonk Conference convening in a few weeks, the
last thing the ex-president needed were reports in the southern press
about a brilliant black Harvard student headed for Europe and one of the
finest prospective educations attained by an American citizen, all
thanks to the Slater Fund. Most assuredly a Du Bois fellowship was not
the appropriate symbol for a policy of training of ""heart and hand.""
Conceivably, Hayes may even have been troubled by the hypocrisy in
replying that the news reports were mistaken, that, in any case, ""the
plan had been given up,"" and that he recognized that Du Bois was a
candidate ""who might otherwise have been given
attention.""[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-18){#cha-18}

No less a figure than Confederate warrior and Alabama legislator Jabez
Lamar Curry, now general agent of both the Peabody and the Slater funds,
had wondered, when his opinion was sought, whether Du Bois's
""persuasive"" endorsements didn't make his case ""exceptionally
meritorious."" Professor Francis Peabody, distantly related to the fund
founder, thought Hayes should appreciate that Du Bois's ""color is in no
way involved"" in his brilliant record. ""It merely indicates that he is
among the most satisfactory students of the last few years."" Taussig,
the economics professor, wrote that Du Bois was ""as good a candidate for
the sort of aid he requests as the TrusteesÂ ... are ever likely to come
across. Not only this, but an excellent candidate [per se.]{.epub-i}""
Dean Charles Dunbar of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences informed the
fund that Harvard regarded Du Bois ""as a young man of exceptional
capacity, of independent mind, fixed purposes and of strong resolution.""
That old Kentucky gentleman Nathaniel Shaler commended Du Bois and his
""rather Shemitic \[sic\]"" type of mind as ""decidedly the best specimen
of his race we have had in our
classes.""[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-19){#cha-19}

When the Slater Fund president opened Du Bois's third letter, dated May
25, he saw that he had a manifesto on his hands. Among the many
thousands of such letters Du Bois would write during his combative
career, this one to Hayes was among the most significant for his race;
for him personally, it was perhaps the most important since his appeal
for a stipend to attend Harvard College. He knew that its perceived
impertinence could fatally mark him in the eyes of the philanthropic
mighty or would jolt them into evaluating his case solely on its merits.
""The outcome of the matter"" was as he expected, he informed Hayes. He
had never doubted that the fund's ""search in vain for men to educate""
was insincere. Moreover, he was ""perfectly capable of fighting alone for
an education"" if the trustees declined to help him. But the
twenty-two-year-old graduate student proceeded to tell the
sixty-nine-year-old former American president that what he had done was
inexcusable:

... The injury you have---unwittingly I trust---done the race I
represent, and am not ashamed of, is almost irreparable. You went before
a number of keenly observant men who looked upon you as an authority in
the matter, and told them in substance that the Negroes of the United
States either couldn't or wouldn't embrace a more liberal opportunity
for advancement.... When now finally you receive three or four
applications for the fulfillment of that offer, the offer is suddenly
withdrawn, while the impression remains.... I think you owe an apology
to the Negro people.

Winding down, Du Bois sardonically related several previous,
unsuccessful attempts to secure help from self-proclaimed white patrons
of his race. ""I find men willing to help me thro' cheap theological
schools, I find men willing to help me use my hands before I have got my
brains in working order, I have an abundance of good wishes on hand, but
I never found a man willing to help me get a Harvard
Ph.D.""[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-20){#cha-20}

Du Bois's shock tactics caused the prospects for his academic
advancement to improve virtually overnight as a chagrined Hayes
encouraged him to reapply the following year. Fund trustee Daniel Coit
Gilman, the president of Johns Hopkins, seems to have favored Du Bois,
probably for the same reasons motivating Jabez Curry, namely that
""negroes as a race need the directive intelligence of characterful
leaders.""[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-21){#cha-21} In the
closing months of his two-year graduate fellowship, then, Du Bois
knocked on the Slater Fund door again---this time more discreetly.
Trusting that Hayes would pardon his importunity, he carefully
elaborated his educational plans for a year of study abroad, again
reminding the fund that the question of his future was of more than
""merely personal interest."" The two, with Gilman, finally met in early
April 1892, in New York City at the old Astor House, where the full
terms of the fellowship were discussed. Du Bois left ""walking on air.""
In a fashionable store window his eye caught a stylish dress shirt
priced at three dollars---four times as much as he had ever paid for a
shirt. He bought it. On the morning of April 13, Hayes noted in his
diary that he and Gilman had decided to give the Harvard student \$750
at 5 percent interest, half in cash outright, with the balance advanced
against a personal note. A friendly card from Du Bois that morning
prompted Hayes's diary entry, ""Very glad to find that he is sensible,
sufficiently religious, able, and a fair
speaker.""[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-22){#cha-22} About one
thing, the Slater Fund president was surely correct: Du Bois was very
able indeed.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[AS THE]{.epub-sc} aging, slow [Amsterdam]{.epub-i} sailed for Europe in
mid-July, Du Bois allowed himself to savor pure exhilaration. Seven
years ago to the month, he had been a privileged wage earner on the
Hopkins estate, praying mightily that ability and luck would finally get
him off to a small southern college. Three years ago, the Fisk graduate
had scrambled for tips in the Minnesota lake country in order to make at
least a year at Harvard possible. Although he registered as a
nonresident candidate for the doctorate under Hart and Channing for the
academic year 1892--93, Du Bois was already contemplating a breakthrough
even more impressive than a Harvard Ph.D. Harvard's degree, after all,
was regarded in about the same light by the leading German universities
as his Fisk bachelor's had been by
Harvard.[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-23){#cha-23} To return to
the United States with a coveted Heidelberg or Berlin doctorate would be
the ultimate seal of professional standing, a personal triumph and a
racial marker. He entered upon this third installment of the Age of
Miracles ""in a trance,"" telling himself over and over, ""'It's not real;
I must be dreaming!'""[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-24){#cha-24}
Still, he remained on his guard and politely aloof from the
[Amsterdam']{.epub-i}s other passengers, no doubt spending a good deal
of time reviewing German grammar in his cabin. In a wash of sunlight the
sprawl of Rotterdam came into view on the morning of August 1, 1892.

The travel notes he began taking are about what we would expect of Du
Bois---detailed, cogent, opinionated. Rotterdam was bustling, a
multinational port so completely yoked to trade that it spoke English,
French, and German even to itself, but little Dutch. Holland, an
""extremely well-ordered mud-puddle,"" was pleasant enough, but because of
Dutch ""phlegm"" Du Bois was forced to spend a full week in Rotterdam
waiting for his Baring Brothers bank draft to
clear.[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-25){#cha-25} Secure in his
habit of standing ""on the outside of the American world, looking in,"" he
was unprepared to discover that culturally, even physically, he fit none
of the preconceptions that most continental Europeans held of American
Negroes---a race less than a generation out of slavery, overwhelmingly
southern, peasant, and minimally literate. Aboard the little steamer
wending up the Rhine was a Dutch mother and her three daughters, two of
them adult and attractive. Once or twice when the steamer docked, he
held back until they left the boat before strolling down the gangplank
to see one of the towns. He felt awkward, choreographing his every move
so as to avoid one of those small scandals he had learned to expect
whenever men and women of the two races commingled in America. But at
DÃ¼sseldorf, the first city in Germany, the more attractive daughter made
him join them, and Du Bois found himself chattering away in German.

What they actually saw is unrecorded. DÃ¼sseldorf was a densely populated
industrial and chemical center, the Pittsburgh of Imperial Germany, fed
by the Ruhr's inexhaustible ore deposits. Having digested every detail
in his Baedeker, Du Bois would have wanted to see the ruins of Frederick
Barbarossa's palace, had there been time enough. The medieval
Lambertuskirche, with its famous crooked tower, would have drawn the
steamer's passengers. When the family finally got off at Cologne, he and
they had become friends in three languages and a dozen or more songs.
The massive thirteenth-century defensive wall circumscribing the ancient
cathedral city had been torn down little more than ten years before, to
be replaced by the encircling roadways of the Ringstrasse. The modern
city now surged outward from the Ringstrasse like some vital fluid
released by its tourniquet into a network of railway arteries. Germany's
oldest chamber of commerce nurtured the city's prosperity. All of this
Du Bois knew from his Baedeker reading as he and the Dutch family
hurried through the Hohe Strasse to the Innenstadt, the heart of
Cologne, tilting their heads upward to marvel at the soaring towers of
the largest Gothic church in northern Europe. The Rathaus and the
Romanesque Querstolzenhaus they would have seen as they passed, but the
splendid reward of their excursion was the illumined interior of Cologne
Cathedral with its massive gold shrine to the Magi and the
fourteenth-century ""Adoration of the Magi,"" the great triptych over the
altar. Seven years later, Du Bois would remember gratefully waving
goodbye to the family there ""in the solemn arched
aisles.""[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-26){#cha-26}

Then, after disembarking at Frankfurt, came Eisenach, an old town, once
the seat of the landgraves of Thuringia, more recently the birthplace of
Johann Sebastian Bach, and one of Germany's most historic. Ringing the
base of a mountain overwhelmed by long, looming Schloss Wartburg,
Hermann I's twelfth-century castle, Eisenach gave the appearance of one
of the kaiser's future battle cruisers at rest in the Thuringian forest.
Du Bois planned to spend seven weeks in intensive German-language
conversation there, living in the pension of Herr Doktor Johannes
Marbach, the rector of the Wartburg, and his
family.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-27){#cha-27} As he wrote to
his old Sunday school in care of Edward Van Lennup, physically the town
reminded Du Bois of Great Barrington, ""if the hills were thrown in
somewhat wilder confusion, our shingles turned into red tiles, and our
streets crooked a bit."" Martin Luther had found shelter in the Wartburg
after the Diet of Worms had ordered his exile. Incognito as Junker
Georg, he had stamped his volcanic personality ineffaceably into the
culture by translating for the first time the Greek New Testament into
German. This bit of history Du Bois related to the Great Barrington
Sunday school, adding to it a jarring fact of equal historic weight by
tracing the Wartburg's age far beyond the time ""when your
great-great-grandfathers stole my great-great-grandfather and brought
him a slave to
America.""[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-28){#cha-28} This was an
early instance of seemingly unconnected turning points in history tied
together didactically---the signature of Du Boisian racial discourse.

He found Eisenach glorious, worshipping in the simple church in the
square where Luther had preached, mastering the libretto of
[TannhÃ¤user]{.epub-i} (Richard Wagner's opera set in the Wartburg),
strolling and picnicking in the woods with the Marbach family and some
of the other boarders, and, hoping Mary Silvina would have condoned it,
learning to drink a great deal of beer in the August evenings. Out of
range of his American demons, he seemed to grow lighter, almost playful,
and more accessible with each week. Eisenach had begun to modify
""profoundly my outlook on life,"" Du Bois always insisted, awakening in
him ""something of the possible beauty and elegance of life."" He began to
escape ""extremes ofÂ ... racial provincialism"" in the company of the
three or four other boarders, all of them European. Blue-eyed,
raven-haired Dora, one of the Marbachs' two daughters, was happy to help
him become ""more
human.""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-29){#cha-29} She paired
herself with him on their chaperoned forays, to church and concerts, and
prompted him to invite her to the town's very formal annual ball.

Five years later at Hampton Institute, the spell of that Eisenach
evening would still be with Du Bois as he recalled publicly the little
social in the brilliantly lit, well-ventilated hall. A young white woman
of good character had placed herself in his arms to be twirled about the
floor, and did so naturally and joyously, with the serene approval of
pouter-pigeon mothers and bewhiskered fathers looking on. A good dancer,
he showed off a bit. But when it was the turn of the women to ask the
men to dance, the hoary ghost of the old visiting-card business in Great
Barrington haunted him just for an instant, and he ""drew back."" He need
not have, ""for \[his\] card was filled for every dance."" Three magical
hours passed gliding from daughters to mothers until it was time to sit
at tables groaning with food and drink. It was an epiphany of
liberation. He had had many good times in life, Du Bois would tell his
Hampton Institute audience, ""but not one to which I look back with more
genuine pleasure and
satisfaction.""[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-30){#cha-30} Later,
he serenaded Dora in his fine baritone and perfect German, and she fell
in love with her Willy.

The arrival of a white American professor and his wife from the Far West
suddenly deflated Pension Marbach's [GemÃ¼tlichkeit.]{.epub-i} Mrs. Far
West Professor hurried Frau Marbach aside to educate the family about
the frightful peril to a daughter who consorted with Negroes. There was
general relief after the couple's departure, but in their wake came a
certain awkwardness---just enough to make Du Bois feel ""a little
sensitive,"" and almost spoiling the most perfect summer of his life.
Dora was unconcerned, however, and asked him to marry her. She would
follow him to America [""'gleich!'""]{.epub-i} (straightaway), she said.
In [Dusk of Dawn]{.epub-i} he would write rather flatly of telling her
""she would not be happy."" Besides, he added, he ""had work to
do.""[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-31){#cha-31} What he did not
tell her was that his own racial pride was as much a bar to
intermarriage as the prejudices of the departed Americans from the Far
West. Yet, sixty years later, he would confess to his second wife that
he had fallen in love with Dora, and leaving her had been painful.
Taking consolation in the proverb [""Es war so schÃ¶n gewessen/Es hat
nicht sollen sein""]{.epub-i} (It would have been so lovely/It could not
be), he went on his promising way. He and the Marbachs exchanged a few
letters, but he never saw Dora again after leaving Eisenach on the
second Saturday in October 1892. As she is not mentioned in the list he
later made of sexual conquests, Du Bois appears to have behaved
honorably, according to the contemporary code of
courtship.[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-32){#cha-32}

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[GERMAN UNIVERSITY]{.epub-sc} lectures began the last week of October.
Du Bois had decided to present himself for admission to the
Friedrich-Wilhelm III UniversitÃ¤t at Berlin, familiarly known as the
University of Berlin, the largest in the Second Reich. Founded in 1809
by Wilhelm von Humboldt, the Prussian minister of education, Berlin was
the parvenu among the continent's great universities, such as Bologna,
Paris, Prague, or Heidelberg. Almost two decades shy of celebrating its
first century when Du Bois enrolled, its excellence was already
legendary in that short time. The fiery Romantic Johann Gottlieb Fichte
had been the first rector, returning grimly from sanctuary in Copenhagen
after Napoleon's retreat in 1807 to deliver [Reden an die deutsche
Nation]{.epub-i} ([Addresses to the German Nation]{.epub-i}), his
cultural marching orders to the German people. Alluding to the virtues
Tacitus had praised in them, Fichte told the Germans that they had a
special mission to redeem human culture. His influence was still far
from slight in Du Bois's time. Professors Gustav von Schmoller and Adolf
Wagner were among the modernizing exponents of the
[Vernunftstaat,]{.epub-i} the rational state presiding over a planned
economy, as proposed by Fichte in his 1800 book [Der geschlossene
Handelsstaat (The Closed Commercial
State).]{.epub-i}[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-33){#cha-33} Georg
Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in the first chair of philosophy had drawn
hundreds to his lectures, while Arthur Schopenhauer, competitively
scheduling his at the same hour, had succumbed to depression in a
near-empty hall. The study of history at Berlin took on scientific
pretensions under Leopold von Ranke that would never entirely be
effaced, however much later generations of historians tried to moderate
them. One of its most illustrious graduates, Max Weber, received a
temporary lectureship during Du Bois's second year, before leaving for a
sociology professorship at
Freiburg.[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-34){#cha-34} For Du Bois,
no other German university held the cachet of Friedrich-Wilhelm.

On the morning of October 17, wedging himself among some two hundred
fellow Americans jabbering about football, Du Bois was almost giddy. He
had just arrived from Weimar and Leipzig. Now he and the others waited
in the long hallway to be presented, one hundred at a time, to the
""Rector Magnificus"" and faculty deans. As they quick-marched into the
famous room 33, Du Bois heard himself announced in German as a ""most
ornamented young man,"" whereupon Rudolf Virchow, the white-haired little
rector, officially welcomed him to the university as a member of the
philosophical faculty, handing him an embossed, folio-sized document
that he now had to present to what seemed an endless array of
high-collared administrators, as well as to those professors whose
lectures he wished to
attend.[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-35){#cha-35} After much
shuffling of papers and ceremony, he left the former palace registered
for a daunting six lecture courses of twenty hours a week, among them
Heinrich von Treitschke's Politics and Adolf Wagner's Political Economy,
plus independent research for Professor Schmoller's economics seminar.
He fairly floated down the Unter den Linden, past Frederick the Great's
huge equestrian statue, the elegant State Opera House, and the
Brandenburg Gate on the way to number 130A Oranienstrasse two miles
away, where, for eight dollars a month, an elderly, motherly landlady
provided morning coffee and an upstairs room warmed by a colossal,
""nicely ornamented"" tile
stove.[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-36){#cha-36}

German professors were not in the habit of coddling students after the
fashion of some of their American counterparts. Berlin students could do
as much or as little as they chose, as one professor told an American
who asked about the required study load. This sort of autonomy suited
the inner-directed Du Bois perfectly. Unlike Hutchins Hapgood, another
Harvard man who ran into him ""apparently having a good time,"" Du Bois
made sure the good times didn't compromise a good German education, as
they did that of Hapgood and a number of other Americans at the
university.[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-37){#cha-37} He sized up
his professors with a superior graduate student's mixture of awe and
perspicacity. Wagner, a tall man with a fringe of brown hair reaching to
his collar, had a ""face rather stern but still kindly."" At Wagner's
mention of Bismarck on the first day, there was a five-minute
""rub-a-dub-dub"" of student disapproval, but Du Bois omits to say whether
he joined in. Rudolf von Gneist was the only professor with wide
knowledge of Anglo-Saxon institutions. Von Treitschke, however, claimed
to know a great deal about virtually everything. A huge man with a full,
iron-gray beard, he arrived twenty minutes late consistently, lumbering
into the hall in a dark cutaway and charging, stone deaf, into his
lectures at breakneck speed, which sorely tested Du Bois's command of
the language.

Taking lodging with a German family rather than in one of the ""American""
boarding houses (where he might not have been welcome), mimicking the
German student's strut, and cultivating Kaiser Wilhelm's mustache under
his fine nose, Du Bois felt exceptionally free, more liberated in these
years than he would ever feel again. Asking the Slater Fund to renew his
fellowship the following year, he would make the point that to the
African-American, ""even more than to the white, is the contact with
European culture of inestimable value in giving him a broad view of men
and affairs.""[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-38){#cha-38} So thin
as almost to be diaphanous now, the veil of race was still there,
largely because, although Du Bois had learned to lift it, it was not in
his psychic makeup to remove it completely because it allowed a lonely
young intellectual to glorify his own race in order to better combat the
glorification of race by
others.[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-39){#cha-39}

The surviving Oranienstrasse diary notebooks have an unmistakable feel
of lonely sublimation about them, frequently lubricated by the grape. An
occasional name bobs to the surface of a narrative rich in travel and
culture---Du Bois's English classmate John Dollar, a girlfriend named
Amalie, two or three
others.[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-40){#cha-40} Otherwise, his
notebooks read like a pageant to which only Du Bois has been invited. He
""kept up \[his\] older habit of travelling
alone.""[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-41){#cha-41} He took
solitary strolls along Friedrichstrasse, through parks, and along
canals. He sat alone in cafÃ©s with a newspaper over a coffee. There were
recorded visits to a prostitute in Potsdam, and slightly tipsy
late-night compositions in his uncarpeted room. These comprise a large
portion of the notebooks, presenting a young man as decoupled from
society in Berlin as he had been in Boston during his first year or
more, although much less tightly wound. One such entry, undated and
untitled, but surely written during his first term at the University of
Berlin, was remarkably Gothic. A woman stands by a window, ""her hair
flying, her gown almost tattered, and in her eye the look of a wild
fierce doe at bay."" A story without beginning or ending, this fragment
offers no clue to the nature of the tragedy enveloping the man and woman
in their darkened bedroom: ""He said not a word but with his eyes bent on
the floor slowly yet resolutely the murderous words rose in her throat
till she gasped in agony, the sweat rolled down her cheeks but mingled
with no tears; tighter yet tighter she grasped the knife in the folds of
her dress---she bent forward---his hand was now extended: a piteous look
of despair.""[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-42){#cha-42} There must
have been some traumatic memory deep within Du Bois that found
expression in this sketch's extravagant imagery and unpunctuated
narration. Perhaps those shadowy figures are Alfred and Mary Silvina
reenacting a crisis in their son's subconscious.

Another piece, a short story written on an early December evening and
headed ""Plot for a Story,"" was about a white orphan boy, ""X"" from Great
Barrington, who grows up to make a success of a dry goods business in
Boston, thanks partly to his fiancÃ©e's father. Over the objections of
his white workers, he hires an attractive, intelligent African-American
female as chief accountant. The dry goods prince was another early
prototype for male protagonists in Du Bois's fiction---uncomplicated,
credulous men whose intellectual and political aptitudes were nurtured
by extraordinary women. The character of the new secretary, portentously
identified only as ""Z"" (for the Zora of his first novel?), was informed
by Du Bois's nascent feminism. Propping up X after the nervous collapse
he suffers after his fiancÃ©e's desertion, she expands his business to
the point where his admiration turns to love. Z refuses his marriage
proposal, undertaking instead his instruction in what would today be
called Third World studies. ""She was born in the South and attempted
teaching,"" but as if anticipating her creator's concept of the Talented
Tenth, Z saw the need ""of a leading aristrocracy to raise her people.""
But before the dry goods prince can invest in her business schemes to
""help civilize Africa,"" his white workers strike, forcing him to fire Z.
X marries his new bookkeeper, raises a family, and years later, while
vacationing at Narragansett, notices the headwaiter's wife and child.
""It is Z. They look and part
forever.""[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-43){#cha-43} Apart from
its psychological import, ""Shattered Ideals"" (its subtitle) is
intriguing for the alliance depicted between educated white wealth and
visionary black intelligence---a politics of global racial progress that
Du Bois seems fascinated by and whose fiercest enemy is the myopic white
working class.

No one could make a virtue of loneliness better than Du Bois. On
Wednesday evening, February 22, 1893, a case in point, he returned to
Oranienstrasse from a Schubert concert and drew up elaborate plans for
his twenty-fifth birthday the next day. The night was bleak and he was
homesick. After writing letters to Great Barrington relatives, he held a
""curiousÂ ... little ceremony"" at midnight of Greek wine, oil, song,
candles, and prayer to the Zeitgeist. ""The second quarter-century of my
life"" would not only bring great personal achievement, he wrote in his
diary, it held great significance for the world. Deadly serious about
this pivot point, he laid out solemn plans for the next day. They were
to be executed with clockwork precision: rising at 7:00 [A.M.]{.epub-sc}
for breakfast; reflection, poetry, and song until 9:30 (""Steal Away
Jesus,"" ""America the Beautiful""); a stroll until 11:00; a museum until
1:00 [P.M.]{.epub-sc}; lunch ""with Einderhof over a bottle of
Rudesheimer and cigarettes""; 3:00 to 6:00, coffee in Potsdam (""saw a
pretty girl""); Schmoller's seminar, 6:00--7:00; and so forth. ""The
program was very pleasantly carried out,"" he reported to himself. ""I go
to bed after one of the happiest days of my
life.""[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-44){#cha-44}

There was more to come later that night. Agitated, probably light-headed
from the wine, he rose in an exalted mood, dedicated his library to the
memory of Mary Silvina, then confided his darkest fears and wildest
aspirations to his notebook. ""Night---grand and wonderful. I am glad I
am living,"" the stream of consciousness entry began:

I rejoice as a strong man to run \[win?\] a race, and I am strong---is
it egotism---is it assurance---or is it the silent call of the world
spirit that makes me feel that I am royal and that beneath my scepter a
world of kings shall bow. The hot dark blood of that \[a\] black
forefather---born king of men---is beating at my heart, and I know that
I am either a genius or a fool. O I wonder what I am---I wonder what the
world is---I wonder if life is worth the striving.... I do know: be the
truth what it may, I will seek it on the pure assumption that it is
worth seeking---and Heaven nor Hell, God nor Devil shall turn me from my
purpose till I die.... There is a grandeur in the very hopelessness of
such a life---life? and is life
all?[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-45){#cha-45}

He knew, too, that the life most fulfilled was the most
beautiful---""beautiful as a dark passionate woman, beautiful as a golden
hearted school girl."" His thoughts on beauty became more specific, more
intense, running to the women he claimed to have loved---""loves, how
many and how dear, she the beautiful whom I worshipped, Ollie the loving
\[lonely?\], Dicky the timid, Jenny the meek, Nellie the wavery child.""
He struck a note of self-indulgent regret about Amalie, the Berlin shop
girl who had been swept up in the physical intensity of their
love---""(perhaps) life-ruin of Amalie which is cruel""---but what could
he, who followed a course exactly opposite St. Pauls, do about
it?[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-46){#cha-46}

His pen raced on. He grasped one existential truth: his own ""best
development is now one and the same with the best development of the
world."" Temporarily liberated from the ""hard iron hands of America,"" he
would bring to perfection his quarter-century ""apprenticeship"" as he
sprinted toward professional service to the world. The notebook entry
closed on a Tamburlainian high: ""These are my plans: to make a name in
\[social?\] science, to make a name in literature and thus to raise my
race. Or perhaps to raise a visible empire in Africa thro' England,
France or Germany. I wonder what will be the outcome? Who knows? I will
go unto the king---which is not according to the law and if I perish---I
PERISH."" Du Bois's seemingly borderline thoughts that night were a
manifestation of his particular genius, as well as of the Sturm und
Drang literary tradition he and many German students of his generation
relished in Goethe's [Sorrows of Young
Werther.]{.epub-i}[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-47){#cha-47}
Laying the notebook aside, he finally went to bed.

The solitary existence Du Bois led among the Germans (and the
psychological insights to be gleaned from it) ought not to be overdrawn.
Financial resources being scant and his studies intensely absorbing,
opportunities for casual friendships were decidedly limited. Moreover,
psychological motives aside, the social-science career upon which he was
embarked demanded, in his judgment, that he reinforce the habit of
systematic observation and generalization of even the most trivial or
transitory phenomena. He was neither humorless nor misanthropic, but it
offended his Puritan upbringing and, much worse, struck him as racially
treasonable not to yoke virtually every experience to purposes that
could be considered intellectually and socially redeeming. His
seriousness of purpose was but a more rigorous version of the uplift
ideology men and women of his generation and presumed class subscribed
to. A unique glimpse of a serious and politely impatient Du Bois in
Berlin would come half a century later when a Chicago attorney wrote to
ask if they hadn't met when both were students at the university. Alfred
Eisenstaedt was positive Du Bois had called at the offices of [Das
Kleine Journal]{.epub-i} in response to an ad for German lessons in
exchange for English. Du Bois had given the young German law student a
tutorial on American race relations that had left him stupefied.
Studying Du Bois's photo in Benjamin Brawley's [History of the American
Negro,]{.epub-i} Eisenstaedt recognized the man who had ""so deeply
touched"" him with a description of the Negro problem that ""even today I
remember these facts.""[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-48){#cha-48}
But there had been no exchange of language lessons after all, the
Chicago attorney recalled, ""I guess because the American student would
have liked to discuss at once the German law and I was at that time only
in the beginning of my
study.""[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-49){#cha-49}

Du Bois's social behavior was constrained, ultimately, by factors that
no amount of attempted gregariousness could really have overcome. There
were numerous instances in which European culture and racial identity
grappled with each other---instances in which he became acutely aware at
some level of a conflict between culture and destiny. A case in point
was the kaiser prancing on horseback through the Brandenburg Gate at the
head of his ""white and golden troops,"" with Du Bois ""thrilled at the
sight"" and stroking his pointed mustaches. As Wilhelm II gleamed and
clanked down the Linden, Du Bois sensed ""that dichotomy which all my
life has characterized my thought,"" he recalled much later; ""how far can
love for my oppressed race accord with love for the oppressing country?
And when these loyalties diverge,"" where could his soul come to
rest?[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-50){#cha-50} When von
Treitschke, a volcanic bigot of encyclopedic learning, suddenly erupted
in class one morning, apropos of nothing in particular, [""Die
Mulattin\[en\] sind niedrig! Sie fuhlen sich niedrig""]{.epub-i}
(Mulattoes are inferior! They feel themselves inferior), Du Bois
insisted the remark was neither directed toward himself nor particularly
upsetting. The lumbering Prussian historian was probably not even aware
that there was a mulatto in the lecture hall, Du Bois thought, nor did
his classmates seem to make the connection. Besides, von Treitschke
often deplored the influence of Jews and criticized the German
government outrageously. ""His outlook is that of the born aristocrat who
has something of the Carlyle contempt of levelling democracy,"" Du Bois
decided. Yet, for all his interpretive generosity, the mulatto from
Great Barrington would hardly have missed the personal relevance of von
Treitschke's invidious
remark.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-51){#cha-51}

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[BUT IF]{.epub-sc} he could never totally belong to Germany and to
Europe, he intended to make certain he fully understood why. Until
Bismarck's devious diplomacy and Helmuth von Moltke's military strategy
made the Hohenzollern Reich possible after a few weeks of summer war in
1870, Germany had been a culture in search of a nation. By population,
three fifths of the formidable new fatherland was Prussian, as was in
spirit if not numbers its monocled officer corps and fustian civil
service.[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-52){#cha-52} Du Bois's
notebook caught the Prussian ethos, as he saw it, just weeks after
settling in at the university. ""German ideals from king to lower orders
appear at first sight to be clad in spurs and shoulder straps,"" he
wrote. Berlin moved in a ""half military stride."" What he saw impelled
him to draw an unfavorable comparison of the German federal system to
the American. The USA was a ""boundlessly optimistic state founded on
individual freedom,"" whereas Germany, for all its order, efficiency,
high culture, and social welfare institutions, was a ""restlessly
pessimistic state founded on
obedience.""[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-53){#cha-53} Yet even as
he recorded these quick, harsh impressions, Germany was in its second
year of liberal reforms under Bismarck's able successor, chancellor Leo
von Caprivi, an unlikely Prussian aristocrat who boasted of owning no
land, and whose policies legalized the Socialist party, created
arbitration courts in industry, and imposed lower agricultural tariffs
on the flabbergasted Junkers of Silesia and Pomerania. Caprivi even
dared to contemplate abolishing the three-class electoral system of the
oligarchic Prussian legislature, or
Diet.[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-54){#cha-54}

Nevertheless, Du Bois saw the Prussian reality; Caprivi's was the
Germany of the enlightened poet Heinrich Heine, a version destined not
to prevail. In Wilhelm II, German emperor and Prussian king, Prussia had
a ruler who pandered to its autocratic, martial inclinations, a monarch
whose own father once snapped, ""Look at my son---the complete Guards
officer.""[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-55){#cha-55} But how true
were these generalizations for Germany beyond Prussia, for Bavaria with
its quirky Wittelsbach dynasty or the cities along the Rhine where the
spirit of '48 survived? The Christmas vacation before that portentous
twenty-fifth birthday, Du Bois had set off with two other Berlin
colleagues, a German-American and the Englishman John Dollar, on a
Baedeker tour, heading first for Goethe's Weimar, then southwest to
Frankfurt, Mannheim, Heidelberg, and the Pfalz region. The route from
Weimar to Frankfurt passed near Eisenach, but Dora was not on the
itinerary. They stayed from Christmas to the New Year in a tiny village
off the map somewhere near Neustadt, in an atmosphere of wine-soused
sociability, where Du Bois set about comparing the mores and living
standards of some twenty peasant families who treated him ""like a
prince!"" with those of Tennessee backcountry African-Americans.
Schmoller, his principal professor, had suggested this topic, which was
intended to be the focus of Du Bois's proposed German doctoral thesis.
In Neustadt, the trio was housed for a week by a family whose head had
driven the first troop train into France during the Franco-Prussian War.
Du Bois remembered fondly the ""fine, homely"" daughter who ""did
everything to make us
comfortable.""[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-56){#cha-56}

The German-American was a decent enough fellow, but, after Strasbourg
and Stuttgart---when the cultural diet thickened with the Raphaels and
Titians in Munich's glorious Alte Pinakothek and became positively
academic at Nuremberg, Albrecht DÃ¼rer's hometown---he dropped out with
relief (his education had ""left no visible results,"" Du Bois
decided).[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-57){#cha-57} The sole male
friendship of his German period began with Dollar on the Christmas
vacation tour. He thought they got on ""famously together"" because they
were such opposites. Dollar was ""coldly and conventionally British"" and
""constitutionally afraid of women."" When he and Dollar roved back to
Berlin by way of Prague and Dresden, Du Bois made the most of his
introduction to German painting, sculpture, and architecture.
Eventually, his knowledge of European masterworks would be distilled
into the richly detailed paper he would read to his first students at
Wilberforce University, ""The Art and Art Galleries of Modern Europe.""
His report to the Slater Fund itemized a frugal total of eighty
dollars.[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-58){#cha-58}

From mid-March to mid-April, when the second semester commenced, Du Bois
and Baedeker (but no Dollar) were on the road again. Applying for
renewal of his Slater stipend, he explained to Gilman of Johns Hopkins
that he could save money by surrendering his Oranienstrasse lodgings and
spending the spring break at Kassel. He traveled there by heading first
to the old Hanseatic cities of LÃ¼beck, Hamburg, and Bremen, then south
to make the obligatory [Harzreise,]{.epub-i} the walk through the Harz
Mountains and up the Brocken, the peak on which, German mythology holds,
the Walpurgis Night revels take place on April 30. His travel notes
mentioned a ""dear girl who met and loved me"" in Kassel, possibly Amalie
but probably someone else; but in any case another woman who serviced
his large and enlarging appetite for
sex.[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-59){#cha-59} The notes were
silent, however, about another matter. That spring excursion brought a
racial experience so shattering that he would never write about it. His
mood had been one of bubbling well-being on a Friday morning as he left
Berlin from the Stettin Bahnhof at dawn aboard the LÃ¼beck express, alone
as usual. ""Floods of the sweetest yellow sunshine"" bathed his
compartment. Lakes and marshes flitted by. He sang quietly a favorite
passage from his favorite symphony, Beethoven's ninth: [""Aller Menschen
werden Bruder.""]{.epub-i} ""So wonderful,"" he exulted in the diary, ""so
wonderful---I could sing it over the wide grey-green fields---over the
green pine forests---over the great north world reawakening today into a
sweet new life of toil and
gladness.""[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-60){#cha-60}

The mood began to falter in LÃ¼beck soon after leaving his small hotel
that evening. At first, there were the little girls ""who rode for one
station and giggled"" at his dark face as he traveled on the streetcar.
He was utterly unprepared for the Saturday-morning experience in the
town market. ""Heavens, but these Lubeckers are curious."" He was ""used to
curiosity on a pretty large scale"" but not like this. Suddenly, they
were pursuing him, men, women, and children, staring, gesticulating,
chattering---the page in his diary became a tablet of almost
indecipherable strokes. ""These children, o God these children---how they
do stare and what can a man do when children stare?"" Anger welled up in
Du Bois, ""anger, and a general feeling of forlornness and homesickness
that is terrible."" By the time he boarded the express for Bremen, the
diary had composed itself, yet, for a page or so, Du Bois showed himself
vulnerable in a way that he would never again permit himself to
record.[[61]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-61){#cha-61} As far as he
was concerned, this slip of the mask, five weeks after his twenty-fifth
birthday, never happened. (These pages in the diary were lost until
now.) The interlude behind him, Du Bois had little time for anything but
academic work and worry about renewal of his fellowship. The answer from
Baltimore came in late May 1893, after a desperate telegram. The Slater
Fund trustees were ""willing to renew"" on the same terms as before. They
awaited his note for \$350.

The future secure again, he decided to take a large fourth-floor room in
the SchÃ¶neberger Ufer, Berlin's fashionable canal neighborhood. Fairly
spacious and comfortably furnished, these were ideal quarters in which
to take the sweeps through literary and philosophical classics his
perfection as gentleman scholar demanded. This was the period in which
Du Bois committed to memory for a lifetime those salient passages he
would recite to intimates or to captivated after-dinner guests. He
delved more deeply than ever before into Goethe, Heine, and Johann
Friedrich von Schiller. [William Tell]{.epub-i} and [Don
Carlos,]{.epub-i} Schiller's great play establishing the use of blank
verse in the German language, would have been familiar, as would the
poet-dramatist's essay on the poetic imagination, [""Ãber naive und
sentimentalische Dichtung.""]{.epub-i} A lengthy letter published in the
September [Herald]{.epub-i} charged Fiskites to master the culture of
Europe and to immerse themselves in Goethe in order to speed ""the rise
of the Negro people.""[[62]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-62){#cha-62}
Between Goethe and Du Bois there was a singular goodness of fit that
made the experience of reading [Young Werther]{.epub-i} and [Wilhelm
Meister]{.epub-i} one of unflagging exaltation; and that of communing
with [Faust]{.epub-i} an epiphany.

Du Bois felt a similar affinity for Hegel, from whose monumental
[Phenomenology of Mind]{.epub-i} he borrowed more or less intact notions
of distinct, hierarchical racial attributes. And for all James's
supposed pragmatic and empirical influences upon him, Du Bois found in
the Hegelian World-Spirit, dialectically actualizing itself through
history, a profoundly appealing concept. ""Lordship and Bondage,"" Hegel's
lodestar essay, explicated a complex reciprocity of master and slave in
which the identities of both could be fully realized only to the extent
that the consciousness of one was mediated through that of the other. If
the master understood dominance, it was the slave who truly understood
the sovereign value of freedom. ""Just as lordship showed its essential
nature to be the reverse of what it wants to be,"" Du Bois read in Hegel,
""so, too, bondage will, when completed, pass into the opposite of what
it immediately is: being a consciousness repressed within itself, it
will enter into itself, and change round into real and true
independence.""[[63]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-63){#cha-63} Surely
this was an idea Du Bois would eventually reformulate more poetically.

In early August at the beginning of the summer recess, he and ""dear old
Dollar"" left for southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Hungary. We
learn a little more about John Dollar on this trip. In addition to being
afraid of women, he had a positive hatred of Catholic priests and felt
deep compassion for suffering humanity. He was also practical. It was
Dollar's idea that they speak German in order to travel more cheaply.
Although the ruse worked, he and Du Bois were somehow mistaken for
French in the Roman Forum and stoned by angry Italian youngsters, an
episode giving Du Bois an unforgettable glimpse of the jingoistic powder
keg one day to be set off by the European system of alliances. After the
funky charm of Naples, they headed north for Venice, then on to Europe's
unrivaled metropolis of paradox---aristocratic, bourgeois Vienna. Dollar
and Du Bois parted company there---""his engagements called him,"" Du Bois
says simply.[[64]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-64){#cha-64} Budapest
offered another striking lesson in the havoc wrought by nationalisms.
Hungarians were so intent upon thumbing their noses at Austrians that Du
Bois had trouble finding officials who would admit to speaking German.
More lessons came as he roamed the back roads of the Austro-Hungarian
empire, always third class and frequently on foot. Few Americans had
ever followed their Baedekers north to Slovakia and into the pines
carpeting the High Tatras, as Du Bois did, a solitary brown scholar with
knapsack and walking stick tacking along what many Europeans called the
edges of civilization. Stanislaus Ritter von Estreicher, one of his
Berlin colleagues, had almost dared Du Bois to visit him in Poland if he
really wanted to see race
problems.[[65]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-65){#cha-65}

On he rode and walked, across lands where he saw a feudal agriculture
strapped to the backs of peasants more ignorant, overworked, and
fatalistic than any in the American
South.[[66]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-66){#cha-66} Seventeen years
in the future, Booker T. Washington would travel first class much the
same route as Du Bois, but although the Tuskegee Institute principal and
the university graduate reached similar conclusions after comparing the
working poor of Europe and America, they put them to very different
political and propaganda
uses.[[67]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-67){#cha-67} Du Bois entered
the part of Poland still ruled from Vienna. By then, he had been
routinely mistaken for a Gypsy and a Jew. Quoted the price of rooms in
the Jewish section of a town by a carriage driver, he had assented
readily, repeating [""Unter die\[den\] Juden""]{.epub-i} (with the Jews).
What he experienced in Poland of race hatred between Poles and Germans,
with anti-Semitism evenly divided between both groups, was a truly
depressing revelation. The lordly von Estreichers of Cracow were
sensitive and enlightened when compared to the usual run of German
masters among the Poles. They welcomed Du Bois to the former Polish
capital as they would have any [grand seigneur.]{.epub-i} They showed
him a world of ancient customs, glacial change, much learning and
gentilesse, but also a world rotten with religious and class hatreds.
""It was an interesting visit and an old tale,"" Du Bois decided, finding
the lot of the people at the bottom and of the religiously persecuted
one of ""tyranny in school work; insult in home and on the street."" Von
Estreicher would die in a concentration camp in 1940 for refusing to
collaborate with the German
occupiers.[[68]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-68){#cha-68}

The final leg of his [Heimreise]{.epub-i} took Du Bois through Breslau
to Dresden and back to Berlin in late September, well in time to have a
comprehensive outline of his doctoral thesis ready by the beginning of
term. After the summer's experiences, he must have felt culturally
equipped to compete no matter what the company. No longer could he ""bear
the thought of living alone again."" He decided to risk the family-style
setup of the Braun Pension, and he was soon smugly satisfied that he had
done so---not only because of the ""pleasant companionship and family
life,"" but for the ""opportunity to teach an American family what a
'nigger' is,"" he wrote, apparently of another prickly experience with
his white compatriots.[[69]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-69){#cha-69}
The likes of Mr. and Mrs. Far West Professor would never disconcert him
again.

\*Â Â Â \*Â Â Â \*

[WHEN THE]{.epub-sc} German Democratic Republic renamed the University
of Berlin in honor of its founder von Humboldt after World War II, it
ordered carved above the columned entrance hall Marx's aphorism, ""Until
now philosophers have only explained the world, our task is to change
it."" More than sixty years earlier, as he strode with cane and gloves to
lectures in its high-ceilinged halls, Du Bois increasingly came to
embody this transforming conception of knowledge. The two professors of
political economy, Schmoller and Wagner, had a profound impact on him in
this direction. Not that old alumnus Marx's ideas were any less anathema
at Berlin than at Harvard. Whereas Marx made the industrial proletariat
the supreme agency of social change, Schmoller and Wagner were elitists
who expected the cream of the Prussian bureaucracy, much of it trained
by them, to guide the guardian state scientifically as it intervened
between the citizen and the market place. Believing that capitalism was
too serious a system to be managed solely by capitalists, they exhorted
the state to ride herd on the great cartels; and with more than a
suggestion of superior German lucidity, Wagner and especially Schmoller
dismissed the self-correcting market laws of Manchester economics almost
as finally as Marx had.[[70]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-70){#cha-70}
Their inspiration was Fichte's concept of an economy whose competing
interests are kept in equilibrium by an intelligent state. Although this
new German school of historical economics was rather a mixed bag, with
large and small differences between Schmoller and Wagner, and colleagues
at other German universities, its distinguishing premise was firm
enough. Du Bois's seminar notes quoted Schmoller as saying ""My school
tries as far as possible to leave the [Sollen]{.epub-i} \[should be\]
for a later stage and study the [Geschehen]{.epub-i} \[what is actual\]
as other sciences have
done.""[[71]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-71){#cha-71} It was another
way of saying what James and Hart had said---that in history, large
patterns emerge only after much sifting of the particulars.

If their claims to scientific methodology ring somehow both
commonsensical and overblown today, this is partly because of the impact
of Schmoller and Wagner in modernizing social science in their time. In
stressing the primacy of observed phenomena over theory or ideal
constructs, they were a force against the system-building dominant in
the social sciences at the end of the nineteenth century, especially
against the grandiose pretentions of the English
engineer-turned-sociologist, Herbert Spencer, and his many enthusiastic
disciples. Schmoller, whose subsequent disparaging of the value-free,
""transcendentalist and purely formal ethic"" of Weberian sociology would
be notable, pounded home in his lectures that sociology was ""as much a
realistic science to me as
economics.""[[72]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-72){#cha-72} Du Bois was
by intellectual temperament profoundly susceptible to a belief in
universals (and, in fact, to all manner of Hegelian excesses), and much
restraint was provided by Schmoller's seminar in political economy and
Wagner's lecture course in the same subject. Max Weber had not then
clearly formulated his concepts of ""ideal types"" and objective
rationality as a unique attempt to combine empirical sociological
research with universals revealed through
history.[[73]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-73){#cha-73} Yet even a few
lectures by Weber had impressed Du Bois by their universalist leanings.
Had he fallen under the tutelage of Georg Simmel, the star of sociology
at Berlin, Du Bois's approach to sociology might have been radically
different. With Simmel, there was an analogous subordination of social
behavior to comprehensive systems.

During the first two semesters at Berlin, what kept Du Bois busiest was
research for his seminar thesis, [""Der Gross und Klein Betrieb des
Ackerbaus, in den Sudstaaten der Vereinigten Staaten,
1840--90,""]{.epub-i} or ""The Large and Small-scale System of Agriculture
in the Southern United States,
1840--1890.""[[74]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-74){#cha-74} Although
he was able to build on his work under Hart at Harvard, the bulk of the
essay was based on new reading, as well as new thinking about history
and economics from, so to speak, the bottom up. But Du Bois seems never
to have explained why the comparative German-peasant dimension of the
thesis failed to materialize. Schmoller expressed enough satisfaction
that Du Bois had been able to inform the Slater Fund trustees (and
condole the death of Hayes) that March of ""a fair possibility"" of being
allowed to stand for his Ph.D. examination in economics once he had
completed only three semesters in residence. A doctorate in economics
from Berlin (""the most difficult of German degrees"") would represent the
capstone of western academic preparation. Not just for himself, then,
but ""for the sake of my race,"" he must try to obtain this degree, he
wrote Gilman.[[75]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-75){#cha-75} Renewal
of his fellowship in May had seemed to seal the prospects for the German
Ph.D. On top of the Schmoller seminar and one with Wagner in economics
and history, he heaped on another in statistics under Professor Neitzen,
as well as a lecture course in the Reformation under Professor Lenz
during his third semester ending in mid-March 1894.

Calling all this ""a deal of work"" while writing his doctoral thesis, Du
Bois managed, in addition to his fuller social life in the Braun Pension
(and the affair with Amalie), to look in on the Socialists. Unable to
win Reichstag approval of the military's seven-year budget, Chancellor
Caprivi had risked national elections in June 1893 rather than
attempting to govern through emergency powers as the tight, high-strung
little circle around the kaiser had advised. The impressive Reichstag
gains of the Social Democratic party (SPD) had surprised Du Bois more
than most Germans. Because Germany's geography dictated vigilant
preparation to fight a war on two fronts, his 1892 notebook ruminations
had concluded that ""a strong military monarchy \[was\] indispensable.""
Party government and democracy would be tantamount to ""committing
suicide,"" given the ""almost total inexperience of her people today""---a
significant notebook confession that would have delighted members of
Mississippi's 1890 constitutional convention. But now, with Caprivi's
conciliatory policies and the meteoric rise in Socialist voters from
1,427,000 in 1890 to almost 2 million, Du Bois was tempted to change his
mind.[[76]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-76){#cha-76} The ideological
distinctions between Marx and the revisionist followers of Ferdinand
Lassalle, August Bebel, and Karl Kautsky were ""too complicated for a
student like myself to understand,"" but he began attending SPD meetings
in the working-class Pankow district, especially after his return from
summer vacation.[[77]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-77){#cha-77}

In the [Autobiography]{.epub-i} he blamed his student status for
hindering ""that close personal acquaintanceship with \[the\] workers""
that he needed in order to gain ""complete understanding."" At this stage
in his political thinking, Du Bois's fascination with socialism was
primarily exploratory, an ambivalent interest in a full-service ideology
providing a comprehensive explanation, prediction, and solution for
economic and social disorders. But for the present and for many years to
come, he remained in the iron grip of an ideology of culture in which
human progress was measured in terms of manners, the arts, great
literature, and great ideals, a secular creed, the intellectual
historian Lewis Perry has observed, which limited profoundly ""how
programs of reform were conceived"" because of its relative indifference
to material comforts and outright disdain for mass agitation. Just how
far Du Bois had yet to go before his acquired elitism allowed him to
empathize with the struggling workers is suggested by another revealing
Berlin notebook entry, ""The Socialism of German Socialists"": too many of
the Socialists belonged to ""that anarchistic, semi-criminal proletariat
which always, in all countries, attaches itself to the most radical
party.""[[78]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-78){#cha-78} Still, he had
taken a significant first step.

On December 6, 1893, the Slater Fund was sent news that the doctoral
thesis was finished. Two days earlier, he had read part of it before
Schmoller's seminar. As he had been given to understand by the dean of
the philosophical faculty in March, he now needed only to submit his
thesis to the Ministry of Education with a request to be examined at the
close of the semester. Naturally assuming that the rest was a mere
formality, he planned to spend his fourth and final semester abroad at
either the University of TÃ¼bingen or the Ecole des Hautes Etudes des
Sciences Politiques in
Paris.[[79]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-79){#cha-79} In a few weeks,
he would realize the twenty-fifth-birthday-night vow to make a name in
social science. On his twenty-sixth birthday, a Friday, he strolled
Friedrichstrasse, savoring the contents of letters from three female
admirers, then decided to drop in for a bit of reading in the seminar
library. He took dinner in the Braun Pension. That night he spent with
devoted Amalie, but before leaving his room about 7:30 he boasted in a
confessional notebook: ""I have finally proved to my entire satisfaction
that my race forms but slight impediment between me and kindred
souls.... I am here free from most of those iron bands that bound me at
home. Therefore, I have gained for my life work new hope and zeal---the
Negro people shall yet stand among the honored of the
world.""[[80]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-80){#cha-80} In the mirror
he saw a trim figure with bristling mustaches and a distinctive
part---Herr Doktor W. E. Burghardt Du Bois of the august University of
Berlin.

Du Bois's failure to win the German doctorate resulted from a
combination of the adventitious and the sinister. Despite Schmoller's
and Wagner's support and the dean's assurances, spirited objections from
the senior professor of chemistry (later Du Bois erroneously blamed the
professor of English) precluded Du Bois's exemption from the requirement
of four completed semesters before a student was permitted to stand for
the doctoral examination. As Du Bois explained to Gilman, this professor
""threatened that if so great an exception was made in my case, he must
bring forward ten similar cases from his
laboratory.""[[81]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-81){#cha-81} Matters of
precedent being as ferociously defended among professors as among
lawyers, Dean Hirschfeld probably foresaw a half dozen more such
objections, once the first had become a matter of record. Du Bois would
have to spend a fourth semester at Berlin, which meant having to wait
out the summer until the beginning of academic year 1894--95 to defend
his thesis. If the Slater Fund agreed to one more renewal---and just for
a half year---then he and the race would have their degree. ""And here I
am in doubt as to my course,"" a notebook entry reads, ""a bit
disappointed but""---the dogged will reasserts itself---""I will have a
[Philosophiae Doctor]{.epub-i} from Berlin."" The puzzling minor chord in
his notebook, that his thesis ""does not suit me,"" he never let sound in
his published writings.[[82]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-82){#cha-82}
Did Du Bois mean by that that the topic was either not broad enough or,
more probably, lacked a European comparative dimension that he had not
developed out of the Christmas study of the twenty village families? The
disappearance of his German doctoral thesis makes the mystery
unsolvable.

Wagner wrote a strong letter of support to the trustees, as did
Schmoller, who pointed out that German universities required six
semesters' work for the Ph.D, and that one semester was occasionally
trimmed or, in Du Bois's case, even two (""because we were able to
express so favorable an opinion""), but, due to the chemistry-professor
complication, unfortunately not three. Du Bois's March 31 letter to
Gilman, asking him ""what is best under the circumstances,"" was
uncharacteristically plaintive. In asking the fund for another
extension, he didn't ""wish to appear grasping on the one hand,"" yet, on
the other, it was unthinkable to ""relinquish a great opportunity without
a struggle.""[[83]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-83){#cha-83} When
Gilman's turndown came toward the end of April, its tone suggested that
the ""recent meeting"" of Slater Fund trustees had been another of those
pivotal gatherings at which leading white men, North and South, threshed
out racial misgivings on African-American backs. Not only had they
decided that it ""was not best to renew your appointment,"" wrote Gilman,
but, in the matter of fellowships to ""advanced students,"" the trustees
had voted ""not to make any other at present."" Gilman advised Du Bois to
present himself for the Ph.D. at Harvard, adding, with a possible hint
of their displeasure at Du Bois's recondite Berlin transcript, that,
""particularly in respect of your course of study,"" some of the trustees
""expressed, with great earnestness, the hope thatÂ ... you will devote
your talent and learning to the good of the colored
race.""[[84]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-84){#cha-84} Was this
Gilman's cryptic way of suggesting that Du Bois's program of study had
become much too rarefied to suit the men who had the heavy
responsibility of guiding Negro higher education into appropriate
channels? The distinguished Johns Hopkins president seemed to be
imparting the view---favored by grey colonels and portly divines---that
Du Bois's case, by its superlative success abroad, merely proved the
original unwisdom of Hayes's experiment in the higher education of
Negroes. How useful to the education of a people one generation removed
from slavery could a University of Berlin--minted teacher be, after all?
What was left of John Slater's million henceforth went toward the
training of primary school teachers and the construction of school
buildings. Black Ph.D.s from Germany were not a priority in Booker T.
Washington's America.

Du Bois grieved in his notebooks; consoling himself with favorite lines
from [Faust: ""Entbehren sollst du, sollst entbehren""]{.epub-i} \[Thou
shalt forgo, shalt do
without\].""[[85]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-85){#cha-85} Then he
left for Paris. No clear picture of Amalie, the young Berliner with whom
he spent many pleasurable evenings, emerges from anything he wrote. Was
she blonde, plump, brunette and svelte, a bit common, or possessed of an
inquiring mind? It's clear Du Bois used Amalie in the egocentric way
that gentlemen of his time and class often did, because he spoke of her
later as the Berlin shop girl with whom he ""lived more or less
regularlyÂ ... but was
ashamed.""[[86]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-86){#cha-86} Since he had
just enough money left to last through Paris and London, it was out of
the question to invite her along on his farewell tour of the south that
spring. Amalie fades from history, as Du Bois took the train for
Magdeburg and Halberstadt in Saxony. He walked up the Brocken again,
writing in his touched-by-destiny prose of fording streams and climbing
mountains during his last day and night in Germany, ""until in full
darkness \[he\] came to an old inn."" Ordering beer and
[Kalbsbraten,]{.epub-i} he dined alone. ""This was my perfect farewell to
a Germany which no longer
exists.""[[87]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-87){#cha-87} As he took his
leave, the Junkers and the great industrialists were making final
preparations to bring down the reform ministry of Chancellor Caprivi.
After October 1894, the tropism of German politics would move inexorably
to the right, even as the voting strength of the Socialists continued to
grow.

The Baedeker pages fly past from now on. Du Bois gamboled through France
in May. ""Saw Paris; wandered wide and deep and,"" he claimed, made his
French ""fairly understandable,"" an assertion gently qualified by
French-speaking acquaintances. He saw Sarah Bernhardt in performance,
applauded the cancan at the Moulin Rouge, and ""haunted"" the Louvre where
he made elaborate notes on the collections. These notes reveal,
unsurprisingly, an appreciation for art that was keener for its
historical than for its aesthetic content, although two statues---the
Praxiteles Venus and Winged Victory of Samothrace---sent his prose
soaring.[[88]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-88){#cha-88} A month later,
he would have soaked up the impassioned sidewalk-cafÃ© talk about the
anarchist assassination of the president of the Third Republic, Sadi
Carnot. That fall, Alfred Dreyfus, a young captain on duty with the army
general staff, would be arrested and tried for treason. But Du Bois left
France in late May for London to spend a few days with ""dear old
Dollar."" Dollar's family maintained a prosperous veterinary surgical
establishment in New Bond Street. He seems to have been one of those
Victorians whose lives were too ordered even for quiet desperation.
Methodically showing Du Bois a gentleman's London---Parliament,
Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's, the National Gallery, the British
Museum---Dollar fended off his visitor's every attempt to pay his own
way, which was just as well because Du Bois had less than twenty dollars
in his wallet. Their last hours together were spent discussing the
architecture of Waterloo Station and casting a sociological eye on the
disparate crowd heading for Southampton. Finally, as the boat train
shuddered forward, they shook hands and Dollar reminded Du Bois of his
advice about cabin selection. ""Dollar, dear old boy, hadn't the
slightest idea that I was going steerage,"" Du Bois chuckled in his
notebook.[[89]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-89){#cha-89} Perhaps not,
but Dollar loaned him a small sum of money to make the passage
pleasanter.

The return to America was vintage huddled masses. The smell of vomit
from drunken fellow travelers woke and drove him out of a dockside shed
into the early Southampton morning. At noon, unshaved and unbathed, he
boarded the ship single file with eight hundred others. Descending with
about 350 passengers to grim quarters deep below deck, he found a
""picturesque and laughable crowd---young and old---lame and well---rags
and fine clothes---Jew and gentile, Russians, English, Americans,
Negroes, Poles, Germans, French, Greeks, Austrians...."" The old and slow
[Chester]{.epub-i} wallowed out of port like an unhappy hippopotamus,
with the German scholar at the rails only just managing to keep his
small breakfast down. Much better on day two, tapping about with cane
and gloves, he began notebook studies of the [Chester']{.epub-i}s
population. He judged there were ""about an even mixture of honest people
and rascals,"" and, in finding the Jewish passengers ""a half-veiled
mystery,"" he revealed how ingrained and reinforced by WASP Harvard and
Lutheran Prussia his New England cast of mind remained. Well acquainted
with upper-class Jewish circles and averse to stereotypes ""from
principle,"" Du Bois nevertheless managed to sound like von Treitschke in
deploring what he perceived as the absence among Jews of ""that strong
middle class which in every nation holds the brunt of culture."" He
supposed that the prevalence of ""the low mean cheating [Pobel]{.epub-i}
\[rabble\]"" was the result of a ""curious history which being peculiar
and unfortunate must have peculiar and unfortunate
results.""[[90]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-90){#cha-90}
Significantly, neither these observations nor the following extremely
revealing one were later carried over into the published writings.
Commenting on the African-Americans aboard, the posthumously edited
[Autobiography]{.epub-i} reads: ""There are five Negroes aboard. We do
not go together."" In the original text, Du Bois had written: ""There are
two full-blooded Negroes aboard and (including myself) 3 half
\[crossed-out\]
mulattoes.""[[91]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-91){#cha-91}

This subtext of proud hybridization is so prevalent in Du Bois's sense
of himself that the failure to notice it in the literature about him is
as remarkable as the complex itself. Graduate student Du Bois had
informed Harvard's trustees that his father was a quadroon, and had
thought it equally useful to misrepresent Mary Silvina to them and the
Slater Fund trustees (""my mother was a mulatto""), and to stress that he
himself was ""about one half or more
Negro.""[[92]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-92){#cha-92} The vocabulary
of Du Bois's generation resounded with the racialisms of Joseph-Arthur
de Gobineau, Edouard Drumont, Francis Galton, Thomas Carlyle, and Bishop
William Stubbs, with evolutionist buzzwords ranking ""superior"" and
""inferior"" races according to pseudo-anthropological findings. In
syntactically tortuous observations made not many years after Du Bois's
return, William James's brother, Henry, approached people off boats like
the [Chester]{.epub-i} with a deep, superior puzzlement that would
become translated into the 1907 classic [The American Scene.]{.epub-i}
African-American college graduates were just as inclined to unthinking
use of these buzzwords, as with Du Bois praising the full-blooded
Negroes on the [Chester]{.epub-i} for ""their goodheartedness---their
straightforwardness.""[[93]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-93){#cha-93}
Moreover, it would have bespoken considerable humility, a quality Du
Bois never intentionally displayed, for him not to have felt, with Fisk,
Harvard, and Berlin imprinted on his haughty face, a certain class
superiority to these ordinary men and women in steerage, whether Negro,
Jew, Russian, or Greek. To the extent that he was parroting the received
unwisdom of the day, he was himself still its victim---if one on the
road to recovery. But was there not also a deeper culpability in these
notebook reflections, a willfully arrogant, private, standing apart as a
different breed from the great majority of the people of the race he
believed it his destiny to uplift? If so, then it was to be anticipated
that his racial militancy would be at once driven and circumscribed by a
marrow-deep elitism for an as-yet-undetermined timespan.

FrÃ©dÃ©ric-Auguste Bartholdi's statue with Emma Lazarus's pedestal
inscription welcomed Du Bois on a clear morning in mid-June 1894. For
two years, he had grown more and more accustomed to meeting white ""men
and women as \[he\] had never met them before,"" and slowly, he found
them becoming ""not white folks, but folks."" Resting his elbows on the
ship's railing, he found himself remembering something a little French
girl had said: ""Oh yes the Statue of Liberty! With its back toward
America, and its face toward France!"" As the [Wanderjahre]{.epub-i} of
his Age of Miracles ended with the [Chester']{.epub-i}s hawsers being
yoked to the pier, Du Bois wrote: ""I dropped suddenly back into
'nigger'-hating
America!""[[94]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter6-94){#cha-94}
"

F[ROM]{.epub-sc} P[HILADELPHIA TO]{.epub-sc} A[TLANTA]{.epub-sc}

I[N THE]{.epub-sc} [Autobiography,]{.epub-i} Du Bois wrote of Professor
Samuel McCune Lindsay of the University of Pennsylvania, the man
responsible for his Philadelphia position, with generosity: ""If Lindsay
had been a smaller man and had been induced to follow the usual American
pattern of treating Negroes, he would have asked me to assist him as his
clerk in this study."" Du Bois adds that he probably would have accepted
the terms, whatever they were---anything to escape Wilberforce! Lindsay
returned the admiration, writing in the introduction to [The
Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} that both Du Bois's training and his
personal qualifications ""proved to be far greater than our highest
expectations.""[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-1){#cha-1} But if the
Wharton School professor seemed cut from the same cloth as Frank Hosmer,
Du Bois never wrote generously about the treatment he received from the
university itself. Its conduct toward him rankled increasingly as the
years went by, so much so that he sometimes understated his
nine-hundred-dollar salary by as much as a
third.[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-2){#cha-2}

First, there was the matter of the unheard of title ""assistant in
sociology,"" without office or teaching responsibilities, except having
once had to ""pilot a pack of idiots through the Negro slums."" ""My name
never actually got into the catalogue,"" Du Bois declared sourly in [Dusk
of Dawn,]{.epub-i} and claimed, somewhat contradictorily in the
[Autobiography,]{.epub-i} that it was ""eventually omitted from the
catalogue."" ""There must have been some opposition,"" he complained,
because he believed the university's invitation had not been
""particularly cordial.""[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-3){#cha-3}
But what really galled him, he insisted, was that after his study was
finished and ready for the printer, it occurred to no one to offer at
least a ""temporary instructorship in the college or in the Wharton
School."" Then, as later, he knew an insult when he saw one. Certainly
from today's perspective, Du Bois's slow burn was entirely
understandable, but he had been slow to anger undoubtably because, as he
admitted much later, the force of racial segregation in 1897 was such
that an appointment simply ""didn't occur to
me.""[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-4){#cha-4}

Two of his biographers have seen in Du Bois's delayed ire over the
Pennsylvania affiliation further evidence of a racial prickliness that
even the deftest solicitude occasionally failed to assuage. ""These are
bitter words,"" the Philadelphia sociologist E. Digby Baltzell tut-tutted
in his introduction to the 1967 edition of [The Philadelphia
Negro,]{.epub-i} ""and apparentlyÂ ... not quite true to the facts of the
case."" In its own defense, the university has underscored the special
and temporary nature of the appointment, expressed profound puzzlement
about any want of cordiality, and placed in evidence page 218 of its
catalogue for 1897--98 announcing that the ""special sociological
investigation of the condition of the Negroes in Philadelphia in the
Seventh WardÂ ... under the direction of William E. Burkhartt \[sic\] Du
Bois, Ph.D., will be concluded January 1, 1898."" By then, however,
Lindsay and the university had seen enough of the Seventh Ward
manuscript to appreciate the author's extraordinary achievement, which
probably explains why Du Bois had been there a year before the catalogue
noticed him. Whatever the tricks of his memory, the October 1896
trustees' minutes seem to confirm Du Bois's suspicion of an intentional
snub. In explaining the appointment, Acting Provost Charles Custis
Harrison is recorded as stating that the former Wilberforce professor
had not been ""placed on the staff"" and need not be listed in the
catalogue. ""Indeed,"" Harrison sniffed, ""I would not have known where to
place or what to call
him.""[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-5){#cha-5} Not only were Du
Bois's feelings (if not his facts) essentially correct about the
University of Pennsylvania, but almost surely, university authorities
had initially seen him as an expendable black person brought there to do
a predictable job.

A hidden agenda had brought Du Bois to Wilberforce, and another brought
him to the University of Pennsylvania in the summer of 1896. But this
time, he was much quicker to size it up. In the late 1890s, Philadelphia
held the largest black community in the North. Because the city's
corrupt political machine derived crucial support from
African-Americans, the city's reforming elites hatched the scheme of
documenting the alarming moral and social conditions among them in order
to mount a more effective campaign to recapture city hall. The old
Philadelphia of solemn Quakers and hardworking Germans going about their
affairs while dark-skinned citizens gamely struggled and, in a fair
measure, contributed to the general prosperity, was a thing of the
pre--Civil War past. That soaring earnest of the good citizenship to
which the city's African-Americans aspired, magnificent Mother Bethel,
flagship worship place of the AME Church, stood a short block from the
Seventh and Lombard address now home to the Du Boises. There had once
been a time when race-proud, civic-minded black men like James Forten,
worth a fabulous hundred thousand dollars from sailmaking; Robert
Purvis, Sr., heir to an even larger textile fortune from his
English-born father, Cyrus Bustill, owner of one of the city's most
prosperous catering establishments; and Richard Allen, founder and first
bishop of the ""vastest and most remarkable product of American Negro
civilization,"" the AME Church (as Du Bois would write), had been
respectfully listened to by the controlling whites of the
city.[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-6){#cha-6}

But Quaker humanitarianism had receded---first gradually, then in a
seeming rout---before economic self-interest and population shifts.
Abolitionist agitation, the Underground Railroad, and a rising number of
plantation escapees became more than annoyances to the city's governing
elites involved in cotton and textiles, and thus in growing solicitude
for the South's Peculiar Institution. As the mills and foundaries pulled
in more and more unskilled whites, Philadelphia's blacks found
themselves whipsawed between elite displeasure and mudsill hatred. Race
riots came as regularly as election campaigns, which were invariably won
by the Democratic machine---1834, 1838, 1842, 1849. Helped by Quaker
stalwarts, James Forten and Robert Purvis grew hoarse protesting the
Scotch-Irish clamor for disfranchisement in 1837, but to no avail. By
amendment to the state constitution the following year, voting became
the exclusive privilege of white men. A few years later, Forten's finely
educated sons found themselves barred from any career that gentlemen of
means might have been expected to
pursue.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-7){#cha-7} When streetcars
began to run in Philadelphia about 1850, they not only killed the coach
business that black men had done so well in, but the newcomer Irish who
had laid the tracks and bullied themselves into a monopoly as conductors
were encouraged to demand that only white people should ride the new
conveyances, although on some lines blacks might ride outside with the
conductor. Professor Edward Turner, the white author of [The Negro in
Pennsylvania,]{.epub-i} winner of the American Historical Association's
1911 prize for scholarship, conceded, more bluntly even than Du Bois,
that ""the history of the relations between the negro and the white man
in Pennsylvania is largely the history of increasing race
prejudice.""[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-8){#cha-8}

After the Civil War, a Republican machine replaced Philadelphia's
Democratic model, and ""as the Irishman had been the tool of the
Democrats, so the Negro became the tool of the Republicans,"" Du Bois
would write.[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-9){#cha-9} The new breed
of finance capitalists and industrialists displayed even greater
indifference to the city's physical character and social ills than the
bankers and merchants of old. Railroads, steel, coal, and oil had taken
the place of cotton for the city's financial mighty. Dignified Biddies,
Drexels, and Cadwaladers receded before the likes of swashbuckling Jay
Cooke, whose 1873 bankruptcy of the Northern Pacific Railroad sent a
great shudder through the Gilded Age. Philadelphia expanded to fill up
the county, spreading from the Delaware to the Schuylkill, leaving much
of the historic heart of the city with its gridiron streets and redbrick
federal facades to the genteel rich and the hard-pressed blacks.
Although no longer the hub of the nation's banking or textile
production, with its almost ninefold population increase from 120,000 in
1850 to 1,046,000 in 1890, Philadelphia was an industrial powerhouse,
headquarters of the behemoth Pennsylvania Railroad, major producer of
steel and ships, a piston in the racing industrial engine. The triumph
of industrial capitalism was under way, even though its rationalization
yet remained to be achieved in its several guises of genteel and
technocratic reform and in the housebreaking of organized labor,
launched with a vengeance after the bloody Pullman Strike of 1894.

Rapacity, conspicuous waste, and inequality were becoming as American as
apple pie thanks to men---businessmen---whose predatory values were
indicted as throwbacks to a feudal age, a view that would receive its
canonical formulation in Thorstein Veblen's [Theory of the Leisure
Class,]{.epub-i} published in the same year as Du Bois's [The
Philadelphia Negro.]{.epub-i} There were some, like Edward Alsworth
Ross, author of the influential book [Sin and Society,]{.epub-i} who
would soon warn with the pith and insight of a latter-day Galbraith that
the Land of Opportunity was being stolen by the opportunists. As
unchecked corporate wealth produced deep pockets of urban poverty
everywhere, political machines fastened on the body politic like giant
succubi, and Philadelphia's, by all accounts, was one of the worst. The
year before the Du Boises moved to the city, fellow Harvard man Boies
Penrose, 250 gourmandizing pounds of Machiavellian brilliance and
personal licentiousness, had had to relinquish the Republican nomination
for mayor after the opposition photographed him tumbling out of a house
of prostitution at 3:00 [A.M.]{.epub-sc} Settling for the U.S. Senate
two years later, Penrose would become the undisputed boss of the state
and tireless opponent of reform for the next twenty years. Anticipating
Lincoln Steffens's exposÃ© in [The Shame of the Cities,]{.epub-i} Du Bois
would be quick to conclude that the government ""of both city and State
is unparalleled in the history of republican government for brazen
dishonesty and bare-faced defiance of public
opinion.""[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-10){#cha-10} In
Philadelphia, the plutocracy left the business of government to the
machine, and the machine left business to business, an arrangement
leaving the rich to get incomparably richer, the politicians answerable
largely to themselves, and the working classes with the crumbs of
patronage. ""New Yorkers vote for Tammany Hall. The Philadelphians do not
vote,"" Steffens would write; ""they are disfranchised."" But if the
Philadelphia machine had become legendary for its orderly corruption by
the mid-1890s, it was only one peculiarly outstanding example of what
passed for municipal government in Boston, New York, Cleveland, St.
Louis, Chicago, and other large
cities.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-11){#cha-11}

To stop the rot, to restore America to Puritan values and Jeffersonian
traditions, to scale back Leviathan capital and empower Main Street and
the town meeting again, a multifaceted, somewhat paradoxical reform
movement arose in Philadelphia and throughout much of America in the
1890s, only to be partially coopted by the very forces it opposed.
Historian Richard Hofstadter proposed the elegant thesis of a ""status
revolution"" to explain who the Progressives were and why they had
emerged. ""The newly rich, the grandiosely or corruptly rich, the masters
of the great corporations, were bypassing the men of the mugwump type,""
he contended---""the old gentry, the merchants of long standing, the
small manufacturers, the established professional men, the civic leaders
of an earlier era.""[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-12){#cha-12} As
the ground of deference gave way under their feet, as polyglot strangers
from abroad ghettoized the cities and sold their votes to colorfully
named traducers of the public trust, and robber barons plundered the
ancestral legacy, the republic seemed to lose its moorings. Hofstadter
pictured these Anglo-Saxon Protestant sons and daughters of parsons,
lawyers, physicians, and small-town businessmen mounting a crusade to
save America for small-town values and incomes even if it meant (as it
did with Du Bois classmate Herbert Croly and his spiritual allies at the
University of Wisconsin) using the Hamiltonian central government to
accomplish Jeffersonian ends. Many were resentful, but even more were
taken by surprise by the proliferation of the mega-rich. Anxious,
resentful, or both, Hofstadter's Progressives trolled the Utopian and
Socialist classics---Henry George's [Progress and Poverty]{.epub-i}
(1879), Edward Bellamy's [Looking Backward,]{.epub-i} (1888)---for
ideas, wrote muckraking exposÃ©s of corporate perfidy in
[McClure's]{.epub-i} and [Cosmopolitan,]{.epub-i} and captured, at least
momentarily, city halls in New York, Detroit, Cleveland, Toledo,
Pittsburgh, and even Jersey
City.[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-13){#cha-13}

But historians have found themselves increasingly unhappy with
Hofstadter's thesis of a revolution in status. In some cases, a careful
nose count of the class and professional backgrounds of the reformers
has shown that they were upper-class professionals fully in tune with
the new business culture and untroubled by status anxiety; furthermore,
much of the impetus for reform came from the much-reviled bankers and
industrialists themselves---Carnegie, Russell Sage, and the
Rockefellers, for example---who used the studies, exposÃ©s, religious
zeal, chambers of commerce, and volunteerism of the distressed upper
middle class for their own consolidating agendas. Machine politics could
make doing business with a city expensive and
inefficient.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-14){#cha-14} In fact,
insofar as it seems to have played a measurable part in reform, a great
deal of the anxiety came from the builders of the new economic
order---anxious not about their own status but about the growing
disaffection of the lower classes. It was, for example, the
apprehensions of the English capitalist Charles Booth and the nocturnal
distress of the elder John Davison Rockefeller (""All the fortune I have
made has not served to compensate for anxiety,"" the owner of virtually
all of Americas petroleum fretted. ""Work by day and worry by night, week
in and week out, month after month."") that produced ideas and money to
fuel much of the reform movement. In his tremendously influential [Life
and Labour of the People in London]{.epub-i} (1889--1902), a monumental
work of empirical sociology on which Du Bois was to base much of the
structure and methodology of [The Philadelphia Negro,]{.epub-i} Booth
sifted, weighed, and graded the poor of East, Central, and South London
with a chemist's cold precision, adding a dollop of behavioral
psychology for good measure, into subclasses of income, work, and
culture.

But looming over exhaustive research and inductive conclusions was
Booth's anxiety that his message about preserving laissez-faire
capitalism would be missed---a little socialism now in order to avoid
too much later. ""Thorough interference on the part of the State with the
lives of a small fraction of the population,"" he winked at his
upper-class readers, ""would tend to make it possible, ultimately, to
dispense with any Socialistic interference in the lives of all the
rest.""[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-15){#cha-15} Booth's
researches and admonitions encouraged Charles Kingsley, Frederick
Denison Maurice, and other sensitive young ""Christian Socialists"" from
Oxford and Cambridge to establish Toynbee Hall in London's East End, the
model for dozens of such settlement houses for workers in Great Britain
and the United States. The board members who built Pittsburgh's new
Kingsley House---three Carnegies, four Fricks, and five Mellons---also
got the message.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-16){#cha-16} Still,
Rockefeller's Baptist conscience warned him that the rich were going to
have to do much more to keep the poor happy with them. He couldn't stop
""worrying about how it was all coming out.""

In the end, Progressives seem to have been divided between those who
were anxious about the future they could no longer afford, and those who
worried about the future they already
owned.[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-17){#cha-17} Hofstadter's
indifference to the existence of the left and right wings of Progressive
reform was misleading. The left-wing Progressives read in the crises of
their times a mandate to embrace social reforms for the benefit of the
exploited and the powerless (immigrants, workers, women, blacks). The
right-wing Progressives saw these crises as symptomatic of beneficent
technological and social consolidation and the coalescence of a positive
new equilibrium. The divergent agendas of the two Progressive factions
would become increasingly apparent over the next ten years or so, and
their impact upon Du Bois would be highly significant.

[AS THE]{.epub-sc} Du Boises settled into their one-room apartment at
700 Lombard Street, William Jennings Bryan delivered his ""Cross of Gold""
speech before the Democratic convention in Chicago. The Republicans had
just chosen Ohio's William McKinley to lead them at St. Louis, to the
self-important satisfaction of Wilberforce's Bishop Arnett. From the
window of their new apartment in the Seventh Ward, Du Bois and Nina saw
and heard terrible sights and sounds of the extreme social misery that
many of Bryan's supporters swore could be put right without destroying
the capitalist system. Du Bois fully shared the widespread belief that
the presidential contest of 1896 would be one of the most important in
the history of the republic. Money redeemable in gold, high tariffs for
home production, and self-regulating industries free of unions were at
stake, the Republicans and [The New York Times]{.epub-i} shouted. The
world of trusts, banks, and industry was menaced by Bryan Democrats and
Tom Watson Populists who wanted to drive gold out with silver, tax
wealth, dismantle tariffs, nationalize transportation, create federal
banks that accepted farmers' crops as collateral, and all manner of
other madcap destruction of property and order. Although the Populists
and Progressives overlapped, in the aggregate they came from different
regions and class backgrounds. Populists were most numerous in the
agrarian South and West and ranged downward from the middle-middle
class. Progressives were northeasterners and midwesterners, were more
citified, and had been recruited from the middle-middle
upward.[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-18){#cha-18}

Du Bois wrote of having followed these developments with an intensity
that made him begin to rethink the laissez-faire economics learned in
Taussig's courses at Harvard. Those visits to Social Democratic
gatherings in Berlin began to have an impact. Populism, he now started
to believe, ""was a third party movement of deep significance,"" and after
McKinley's victory, financed by a then-fabulous election fund of almost
\$20 million, he began to see, too, that politics and economics were
""but two aspects of a united body of action and
effort.""[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-19){#cha-19} It was a
Populist insight that carried over into progressivism and an insight
that would inform the large project of research and writing called for
in his contract with the University of Pennsylvania and its affiliated
welfare organization, the College Settlement Association (CSA).

Philadelphia's Seventh Ward was a progressive reformer's worst
nightmare. Cut off from the Delaware River by the stubby Fifth Ward, it
ran between Spruce and South streets, eighteen gridiron blocks due west
from Seventh Street to the Schuylkill. About forty thousand
African-Americans lived in the city, 9,675 of them in the Seventh Ward,
of whom 5,174 were females. Philadelphia's ethnic groups tended to be
spread throughout its wards, rather than to be densely packed in clearly
demarcated German, Irish, Italian, Polish, or Jewish neighborhoods. It
was fairly exceptional among other American cities in this
respect.[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-20){#cha-20} But
African-Americans, although also somewhat dispersed, lived mostly in
four wards, with the seventh being home to 25 percent. Because so many
lived there, because many of them were so poor, because many had
recently arrived from the South, because they were responsible for so
much crime, and because they stood out by color and culture so
conspicuously in the eyes of their white neighbors, the area was the
bane of respectable Philadelphia, its population the very embodiment of
""the dangerous classes"" troubling the sleep of the modernizing gentry.

Life was hard, noisy, and deadly for too many of the black people there.
On Saturday nights the smoky, loud-music honky-tonks in Carver and
Minister alleys and the miserable shotgun row houses squeezed together
near the south end of Seventh up to South Street always disgorged maimed
and murdered clients and dwellers before morning. Pennsylvania Hospital
two blocks away on Pine Street was practically swamped by the grisly
medical problems of black males in the grip of social pathologies. There
was simply no evading the hard fact, as Du Bois quickly saw, that ""from
his earliest advent the NegroÂ ... has figured largely in the criminal
annals of
Philadelphia.""[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-21){#cha-21} With
eight of every ten males working at unskilled jobs, the Germans and
Italians driving them out of catering and barbering, the Irish and other
comparably unskilled newcomers fiercely maintaining a color bar in the
craft and industrial unions, it was not surprising that many Seventh
Ward blacks sought release in drugs and crime or savagely turned on each
other out of rage and a sense of hopelessness.

Respectable Philadelphia habitually deplored these worsening conditions,
and would have continued to do little about them, but for the fact that
the Seventh Ward was also home to many of the city's most distinguished
white families. When the better-government ladies had gone among their
black neighbors in an effort to rally support for their 1895 slate of
school-board reformers (enlisting the distinguished energies of Mrs.
Fanny J. Coppin, Oberlin graduate and principal of the Friends Institute
for Colored Youth), they ran into a stone wall of hostility. Reform had
gone down to defeat greatly helped, Du Bois would explain, by Seventh
Ward voters who preferred the corruption and patronage they knew to the
high-toned platform of ""women who did not apparently know there were any
Negroes on earth until they wanted their
votes.""[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-22){#cha-22} It was then
that Quaker Susan P. Wharton convened a strategy meeting in the
ancestral town house at 910 Clinton Street near the heart of the Negro
ghetto. Her Seventh Ward neighbor, retired sugar tycoon Dr. Charles
Custis Harrison, presided. Harrison had recently taken up the post of
acting provost of the University of Pennsylvania. Wharton urged a
comprehensive study of the Negro population to be undertaken by the
university in collaboration with the Philadelphia branch of the CSA, on
whose executive committee she had served since its founding in
1890.[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-23){#cha-23}

Inspired by Booth's [Life and Labour]{.epub-i} and pilgrimages to
London's East End, the CSA had been founded by the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of
morally motivated America (Jane Addams, Ellen Gates Starr, Vida Scudder,
Sophonisba Breckinridge, Stanton Coit, Charles Stover, and others) who
rapidly established uplift houses in imitation of Toynbee Hall in the
industrial North---Hiram House in Cleveland, South End in Boston,
Kingsley in Pittsburgh, and, most famous of all, Hull House in
Chicago.[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-24){#cha-24} The left wing
of Progressive reform was alive and well in the settlement movement,
although older and mostly male establishment types like Columbia
University president and future New York reform mayor Seth Low,
department-store magnate and Hampton Institute benefactor Robert C.
Ogden, and even Wharton, represented more of the right wing's
paternalism than the left wing's mobilizing fervor. Some eight hundred
Smith, Vassar, Wellesley, and other suffragettes strong, and numbering
men of influence among its cadre, the CSA was a feminist force to reckon
with for civic leaders. For that reason alone, Provost Harrison would
have given Wharton a hearing; and because she was a Wharton, he listened
avidly to her proposal. She was sure that Ogden would support it, as
would her family friend Talcott Williams of the Philadelphia
[Press.]{.epub-i} Miss Wharton thought she knew just the man to oversee
the project: Samuel McCune Lindsay, assistant professor in the sociology
department of the university's Wharton School and an active member of
the CSA. Better still, her Smith College friend Miss Isabel Eaton,
daughter of Union General John Eaton and candidate for the master's
degree in sociology at Columbia, could do much of the field
research.[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-25){#cha-25}

Harrison and Wharton, like many Progressives (especially older ones),
were prey to eugenic nightmares about ""native stock"" and the better
classes being swamped by fecund, dysgenic aliens. The conservative CSA
gentry thought of poverty in epidemiological terms, as a virus to be
quarantined---""a hopeless element in the social wreckage,"" as Lindsay
had written in a report on municipal welfare, to be ""prevented, if
possible, from accumulating too rapidly or contaminating the closely
allied product just outside the almshouse
door.""[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-26){#cha-26} Such was the
virulence of this black plague that Lindsay urged that a promising young
African-American scholar, a male, be given the direction of the Seventh
Ward study, instead of one of Wharton's feminists. Not only was this
dangerous work, but the deplorable findings would have greater
credibility if they came from a researcher of the same race as his
subjects. ""I was the man to do it,"" said the nine-hundred-dollar-a-year
assistant in sociology whose findings would determine the nature and
duration of the quarantine that the city's notables intended to impose.
Isabel Eaton, a specialist on sweatshops and domestic service, remained
in the picture, nonetheless. She joined Du Bois in the fall of 1897, and
would work closely with him while pursuing her parallel investigations
among white employees.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-27){#cha-27}
Whatever Eaton's role, Du Bois was expected to take responsibility for
diagnosing the exact nature of the virus among Philadelphia's
African-Americans.

Harrison drew up Du Bois's charge: ""We want to know precisely how this
class of people live; what occupations they follow; from what
occupations they are excluded; how many of their children go to school;
and to ascertain every fact which will throw light on this social
problem."" But Du Bois knew that his sponsors held a theory about the
race to be studied. The city was ""going to the dogs because of the crime
and venality of its Negro citizens."" ""Something is wrong with a race
that is responsible for so much crime,"" the theory ran, and ""strong
remedies are called for."" Another junior academic (and a minority
scholar at that), given the chance to impress rich and pedigreed
sponsors for future assignments and fellowships, might have been
conscientious about fleshing out the data but neutral or even collusive
about their implications. To believe Du Bois, however, he ""neither knew
nor cared"" about the agenda of the reformers. ""The world was thinking
wrong about race, because it did not know."" He would teach it to think
right. The task was ""simple and clear-cut"" for someone with his
cutting-edge training in sociology. He proposed to ""find out what was
the matter with this area and why,"" and he would ask ""little advice as
to procedure.""[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-28){#cha-28} It was
an opportunity---a mandate, really---whose scientific and racial
implications made the politics behind his appointment unimportant.

This pose of peerless wisdom and sublime self-assurance was overdrawn as
usual. Du Bois knew what the ulterior aims of his sponsors were, and he
knew that he had to care. As in his Jefferson Davis address at Harvard,
in which adversary terms and symbols performed a seductive Apache dance,
there would be several clashing premises in [The Philadelphia
Negro.]{.epub-i} Seeing himself as the custodian of privileged insights
capable of transforming American race relations, Du Bois was determined
to gain the widest and most respectful hearing possible. But to do this,
he obviously must have calculated that it would be necessary to write
what amounted almost to two books in one---one that would not be
immediately denounced or ridiculed by the arbiters of mainstream
knowledge, influence, and order for its transparent heterodoxy; and a
second one that would, over time, deeply penetrate the social sciences
and gradually improve race-relations policy through its not-immediately
apparent interpretive radicalism. He set about, then, to write a study
affirming and modifying, yet also significantly subverting, the received
sociological wisdom of the day. He would give the CSA Progressives facts
and judgments with which to support their moralizing and piecemeal
reformism. And he would do so with a clear conscience, in large part
because of his higher racial and social-science purposes, but also
because his elitist temperament led him naturally into prim
sententiousness about bottom-class manners and institutions. ""The main
results of the inquiry seem credible,"" he would write. ""They agree, to a
large extent, with general public
opinion.""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-29){#cha-29} Like its
author, [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} was to enter the twentieth
century frequently looking backward. But long stretches of the road were
modern. ""In other respects,"" Du Bois would signal, [The Philadelphia
Negro]{.epub-i} was based on interpretations ""logically explicable or in
accord with historical precedents."" Behind the moralizing, and the stern
admonitions to black people to behave like lending-library patrons, the
book would speak calmly yet devastatingly of the history and logic of
poverty and racism.[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-30){#cha-30}

Some have made the debatable claim that [The Philadelphia
Negro]{.epub-i} is the first study of its kind in America, but its pride
of place as the first scientific urban study of African-Americans is as
secure as the charge is misconceived that Du Bois's book is largely
derivative. The groundbreaking [Hull House Maps and Papers,]{.epub-i}
appearing during his final year at Wilberforce, served as an invaluable
model for his own study, while ongoing city surveys of low-income groups
in New York, Boston, Washington, and Chicago, published regularly in the
annual reports of the CSA and [The Congregationalist,]{.epub-i} were
additional guideposts. Finally, of course, he owed a large debt to [Life
and Labour of the People in London.]{.epub-i} What Booth called his
""double method"" of dividing his subjects by district ""and again by
trades, so as to show at once the manner of their life and work""
decisively shaped Du Bois's Seventh Ward study. The six schedules in
[The Philadelphia Negro,]{.epub-i} covering families, individuals,
homes, street activity, community institutions, and a special category
dealing with individuals, were patterned on Booth's. [Hull House Maps
and Papers]{.epub-i} displayed a similar reliance on the methodology in
[Life and
Labour.]{.epub-i}[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-31){#cha-31} The
thoroughness with which Du Bois refined and applied what he borrowed,
however, was characteristically remarkable.

Leaving Nina with the daily grocery list, which he prepared as carefully
as one of his research schedules, Du Bois sallied forth on quick firm
steps each morning, accoutered with cane and gloves, to spend an
eight-hour day knocking on the doors of his new neighbors. Unassisted,
indefatigable, he would sit for an average of twenty minutes patiently
guiding often barely literate, suspicious adults through a series of
questions on the six schedules while infants usually scampered and
yawped under the kitchen table. More than a few times, he was challenged
at the front door with the question, ""Are we animals to be dissected and
by an unknown Negro at that?"" but only a dozen times was he flatly
refused entry. Historian Herbert Aptheker has calculated that Du Bois
spent some 835 hours interviewing approximately 2,500 households over
the three-month period of field research beginning in early August
1896.[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-32){#cha-32} No representative
sampling for Du Bois. As he tabulated some fifteen thousand household
schedules, he had before him life histories of the entire black
population of the Seventh Ward---nearly ten thousand men, women, and
children.

Susan Wharton's friend, Isabel Eaton, had taken a tiny room in the
Lombard Street settlement by then in order to collaborate on the study.
Her specific interest was domestic service, an area of research in which
her mentor, Professor Lucy Maynard Salmon of Vassar, had just produced a
major monograph, [Domestic Service.]{.epub-i} Although Du Bois would
stress repeatedly that his great work of urban sociology was a solitary
enterprise---that he alone conducted the interviews and made the
tabulations---the fact that Eaton's signature follows several lengthy,
informative footnotes in [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} suggests her
more than incidental input. She had firsthand knowledge of
management-labor tensions around the issue of race, particularly at the
Midvale Steel plant where the young efficiency expert Frederick W.
Taylor's concepts clashed with the practices current elsewhere in
Philadelphia of deferring to the racially exclusive demands of labor.
Eaton was cut from the same cloth as Katherine Bement Davis, who ran the
Lombard Street settlement house until 1897. Davis was known to vent her
anger against slum tenements in the manner of a Carrie Nation destroying
saloon counters. Both Eaton and Du Bois found a valuable friend in this
future New York City commissioner of
corrections.[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-33){#cha-33}

Eaton and Davis were members of the settlement movement's younger
feminist vanguard, and as such were readily distinguishable from men
like Harrison, Low, or department-store magnate John Wanamaker by their
nonpaternalist concerns for the welfare of the disadvantaged. They were
discovering that working-class males had no use whatsoever for
well-intentioned centers run by upper-class-native females. They were
still learning that immigrants had their own definite views about how to
become Americans. And they were even beginning to grasp that solving the
problems of urban African-Americans demanded the same white-knuckled
patience and commitment to economic justice that they gave the European
newcomers. Above all, unlike many of their solid-citizen male
associates, they were sincerely trying to
learn.[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-34){#cha-34} Few hard details
of what was, for the times, a unique interracial collaboration exist,
yet Eaton's presence and loyal support of Du Bois's conceptualization of
the Seventh Ward project would be significant. Had Eaton---a social
scientist in her own right and a gentlewoman of impeccable
connections---not acquiesced in Du Bois's independent tack or had she
opposed the fundamentally radical underpinnings of his evolving study,
the storm clouds over 700 Lombard Street might well have drowned Du
Bois's second book in controversy. Eaton's affinity for Du Bois would
bring her to his side fourteen years later when the forces opposing
Booker T. Washington rallied to establish an effective civil rights
organization.

Nina offered him a different brand of support entirely. Their one room
above a cafeteria was kept spotless and tastefully brightened by fresh
flowers. There may have been an allegorical print on a wall, perhaps a
lace antimacassar or two on the rather worn chairs. She was not expected
to try to take part in her husband's intellectual life. ""Her great
gift,"" as Du Bois saw it, ""was her singularly honest character, her
passion for cleanliness and order and her loyalty."" ""Good and peaceful""
Nina was a German professor's ideal mate. They believed they were
deeply, mutually in love, and he relished the striking impression they
made when strolling together on crisp autumn weekends; Du Bois boasted
that ""people used to stop and stare at her in the street."" Years later,
after little remained of the marriage save the husk of principled
mutuality, he spoke guiltily of having made ""their first home in the
slums of Philadelphia.""[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-35){#cha-35}
During the day, ""kids played intriguing games like 'cops and lady bums'""
there, and when ""pistols popped \[at night\], you didn't get up lest you
find you couldn't""---circumstances Nina had never before encountered in
her protected, parochial
life.[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-36){#cha-36} Yet Du Bois's
diary description of their social outings and playful private hours
during the 1896 Christmas holidays suggests that Nina was joyfully
unruffled at finding herself in a ghetto with the man she adored. On
Christmas morning, Du Bois awoke, catching his ""wife in her little gown
secreting bundles in and around my socks."" Laughing, he ""kept as quiet""
as he could. ""Finally the whole day melted away in misty happiness.""

Although this account, with its sexist condescension, grates today,
there was nothing false or atypical about it in 1896 as a depiction of
happy late-Victorian domesticity. These, and the twenty-odd months to
follow in Atlanta, were probably the happiest of Nina's married life.
Her only surviving letter from this honeymoon period was written in
early September when she was waiting in Wilberforce until money arrived
so she could join her ""pet"" in Philadelphia. ""I'm feeling real good,""
she wrote in what may have been an indirect reference to her chronic
health problems. ""I think I'll be good and well when I come home to
you.""[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-37){#cha-37} Will and Nina had
not yet begun to notice that they were different beyond incompatibility.
Although Nina was obviously intelligent, she was as far from being an
intellectual as one of the Great Barrington Burghardts. Will Du Bois was
breadth and depth; she---or so it came to appear to most observers---was
the flat, smooth surface of a plane. It was the union of a think tank
and a millinery shop. Their lives together would be passed in different,
incommensurable dimensions. Du Bois would tend to write about her with
brevity and a tinge of condescension, and, as with intimate matters
generally, would give the wrong year for their marriage when he wrote
her obituary half a century
later.[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-38){#cha-38}

From what Du Bois wrote in the [Autobiography]{.epub-i} and confided
much later to his daughter's first husband, Nina was a reluctant learner
who never managed to overcome a feeling that sex was ""fundamentally
indecent."" Persuading her otherwise was no ""easy task for a normal and
lusty young man,"" but in early February 1897, the month of his
twenty-ninth birthday, they conceived a son, whose arrival, ""suddenly,
unexpectedly, miraculously,"" on October 2, 1897, Du Bois would celebrate
ecstatically.[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-39){#cha-39} Nina's
accouchement would take place in Great Barrington, where she was sent to
stay with Uncle James and other Burghardt relatives, the little
settlement-house room being clearly unsatisfactory. The demands of the
Seventh Ward project were such that he would miss his son's birth. When
he was finally able to tear himself away several weeks later, he
confessed to not quite knowing how to respond to ""this newborn wail from
an unknown world""; but for Nina, his ""girl-mother"" now a ""transfigured
woman,"" the lustful lover experienced a powerfully deepened
affection.[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-40){#cha-40}

His other child, [The Philadelphia Negro,]{.epub-i} called him away from
Great Barrington after a day or so. While Nina suckled her perfect
Burghardt in the Berkshires, her husband drove himself to produce an
equally perfect creation in Philadelphia. He had something of Herbert
Spencer's confidence in both objective social science and in real-world
application of its findings but without the British sociologist's
mechanistic determinism. This faith was to be spelled out in two public
speeches delivered while [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} was well
under way during 1897, the first at a CSA meeting in March and the
second, fuller and more significantly, before the forty-fourth session
of the American Academy of Political and Social Science on November 19
in Philadelphia. ""The Study of the Negro Problems"" before the academy
was a replay of his precedent-breaking, well-received, and widely
commented-upon American Historical Association presentation in 1891.
Introduced by Provost Harrison, Du Bois began by complimenting the
university's Seventh Ward undertaking, and went on to make the
plea---the first ever before mainstream scholars---that the great
research universities of Harvard, Columbia, and Johns Hopkins join with
Pennsylvania to support, with money and resources, a comprehensive,
long-term study of the ""Negro question"" at Tuskegee, Hampton, or Atlanta
University. ""What more effective or suitable agency could be found,"" he
asked (with himself obviously in mind for the role), ""than to focus the
scientific efforts of the great universities of the North and East, on
an institution situated in the very heart of these social
problems?""[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-41){#cha-41}

Du Bois pressed his audience with an advancement-of-mankind savvy that
subsequent academic supplicants of foundation support have not greatly
improved upon. ""The American Negro deserves study for the great end of
advancing the cause of science in general,"" the young phenomenon said,
his normally dry voice registering the excitement of a self-anointed
mandate:

No such opportunity to watch and measure the history and development of
a great race of men ever presented itself to the scholars of a modern
nation. If they miss this opportunity---if they do the work in a
slipshod, unsystematic manner---if they dally with the truth to humor
the whims of the day, they do far more to hurt the good name of the
American people; they hurt the cause of scientific truth the world over;
they voluntarily decrease human knowledge of a universe of which we are
ignorant enough, and they degrade the high end of truth-seeking in a day
when they need more and more to dwell upon its
sanctity.[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-42){#cha-42}

Applause followed, as well as spirited discussion of the academy paper
by noted historian John Bach McMaster, Howard University physician
Daniel Hale Williams, a future pioneer of heart surgery, and two
ministers. But nothing else was forthcoming. It would not be the last
time Du Bois would stand before a leading body of largely white
influentials vainly appealing for a pittance of support for solid
research into the conditions of his race. If men like Harrison and
Lindsay (or Hart for that matter) felt any regret or guilt about the
caste system that precluded hiring a brown-skinned Harvard man, the
exceptional [Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i} commission for Du Bois along
with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics contract earlier that year may
well have assuaged their consciences.

With the clock ticking on his Pennsylvania appointment (it expired
January 1, 1898), Du Bois had responded to a February 16, 1897, letter
from the head of the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicating the
possibility of employment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, then housed
in the Department of the Interior, was headed by the eminent economist
Carroll Davidson Wright, future president of Clark University, who
served as first commissioner of labor from 1885 to 1905. Wright's
comprehensive [Industrial Evolution of the United States]{.epub-i} had
appeared in 1895 and he was finishing his prodigious [Outline of
Practical Sociology.]{.epub-i} Obviously abreast of the impressive job
Du Bois was reported to be doing in Philadelphia, Wright wrote to
inquire whether Du Bois would be interested in the bureau's plans to
conduct investigations ""relating to the economic progress of the colored
people."" In an almost enthusiastic reply to Wright on February 18, Du
Bois told the labor commissioner that he had given the subject a great
deal of thought and already had in mind some rather definite proposals
that he would be pleased to discuss during a ""half hour of leisure on
the 3d, 4th, 5th or 6th of March,"" when he was due to be in
Washington.[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-43){#cha-43} Six days
later, Lindsay sent his acquaintance Wright a somewhat remote but
encouraging endorsement of Du Bois. The Washington interview with
Wright, which took place during the week of the American Negro Academy
presentation of ""The Conservation of Races,"" resulted in Du Bois's being
hired temporarily to conduct studies of African-American social and
economic conditions in the South.

There followed on May 5 and June 14 two closely reasoned letter
proposals of the type that were to become the signature of Du Bois's
scholarship. In the second, he announced his decision to locate and
study a prototype township, ""a small place of 1000--2000 Negro
inhabitants, situated about midway between Petersburg \[Virginia\] and
the North Carolina line; from this district a large part of the Negro
immigration to Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, and New York sets
out."" The resulting paper, ""The Negroes of Farmville, Virginia: A Social
Study,"" would appear as the labor bureau's [Bulletin]{.epub-i} 3, no.
14, in January 1898. ""My idea,"" Du Bois would emphasize four years later
before a congressional committee, ""has always been that in order to
really get at the South and carry out any theories we ought to have a
very careful basis in
fact.""[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-44){#cha-44} Hard at work on
[The Philadelphia Negro,]{.epub-i} Du Bois managed to spend July and
August in Farmville, the seat of stagnating Prince Edward County and the
tobacco-trading center for six counties. The study was a small
masterpiece of great range and depth, influencing the conclusions of the
Seventh Ward monograph and serving as the standard for the Atlanta
University Studies of which he was then planning to take charge. In that
era of Spencerian sociology when theorizing took precedence over
palpable knowledge, he plunged into the backwater community with gusto,
determined to explore the place from the bottom up. He would boast of
having ""lived with the colored people, joined in their social life, and
visited their homes.""[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-45){#cha-45}

The people Du Bois had come to study were mainly men and women belonging
to the second generation after slavery. Farmville's population had taken
a century to grow from four thousand white and four thousand black
people to a total of fourteen thousand, but the increase was due almost
entirely to reproduction and in-migration of blacks. The town was the
archetypal point of departure for the coming Great Black Migration. The
schedules for the Virginia town---mortality, family structure, conjugal
condition, sex, property holdings, businesses, employment, schooling,
literacy---were the building blocks for Du Bois's novel, informed
reflections on miscegenation, the impact of slavery on contemporary
social behavior, Afro-America's evolving class structure, the complex
character of the black family, and, above all, the ramifications of the
industrial earthquake shaking up Farmvilles everywhere. Throughout
""Farmville"" he made comparisons to similar German, British, French,
Hungarian, and Italian populations in order to demonstrate the generally
corrosive impact of industry upon traditional cultures; but when it came
to African-American morality Du Bois's measure was a rigid Calvinist
ruler. Crummellian judgments abounded: ""The moral tone of the Negroes
has room for great betterment""; slum elements ""receive recruits from the
lazy, shiftless, and dissolute of the country around""; ""When among any
people a low inherited standard of sexual morals is coincident with an
economic situationÂ ... promot\[ing\] abnormal migrationsÂ ... then the
inevitable result is prostitution and
illegitimacy.""[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-46){#cha-46}

Yet along with the moralizing came the first documented sociological
insights into evolving Afro-America. Among the outstanding
characteristics he recorded at the outset were ""postponing marriage
largely for economic reasons"" and the outmigration of the young ""to
better its conditions."" Du Bois predicted the disintegrative pressures
on the race as it became urbanized. The black family, he insisted, was
still recovering from the ravages of slavery. Its fragility would place
African-Americans at high risk as they experienced the shocks of
modernization. Initiative and enterprise were also tainted by the
slavery experience. These people were too good for domestic service and
were ""coming to regard the work as a relic of slavery, and as degrading,
and only enter it from sheer necessity."" ""The slum elements of Farmville
are as yet small,"" he noted, ""but they are destined to grow with the
town."" There was a positive side, nevertheless, to the collapse of
primary institutions and the rise of self-inflicted indigence. They were
the casualties of progress---""evils inseparable from a transition
period, and they will remain until the industrial situation becomes
satisfactory, migration becomes normal, and moral standards become
settled."" Du Bois's concluding observation about Farmville's social
structure was seminal, although it would be consistently ignored by
scholars for many years. Despite high crime rates, dysfunctional
families, rudimentary education, and high levels of unemployment, he
distinctly detected upward mobility and class formation in
Farmville-America: ""One thing, however, is clear, and that is the
growing differentiation of classes among Negroes, even in small
communities.""[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-47){#cha-47}

There were to be four more Bureau of Labor Statistics studies, an 1899
study of five Black Belt counties in Georgia and one in Alabama, a
second in 1901 of ""The Negro Landholder of Georgia,"" a third expanding
the previous one, and the 1906 chef d'oeuvre on the Negroes of Lowndes
County, Alabama, which was
destroyed.[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-48){#cha-48} But although
Du Bois had probably hoped, at least originally, to win a civil service
appointment in Washington through merit, he would remain only a sometime
consultant. Meanwhile, it buoyed his spirits to hear that the editor of
the [Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i} wanted a piece on current aspirations
among black Americans. Another invitation had come to give a paper at
the much-publicized General Conference of Negroes in July, sponsored by
the Hampton Institute and meeting in
Norfolk.[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-49){#cha-49} By now,
favorable critical reception of [The Suppression of the African Slave
Trade]{.epub-i} had made him one of the most talked-about young scholars
in the country. Nevertheless, as summer 1897 ended, he still needed a
job and was about to become a new father.

In June, Hart pressed Booker T. Washington about hiring Du Bois, sending
a follow-up letter on August 10 that betrayed puzzled impatience: ""Have
you no place for the best educated colored man available for college
work?""[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-50){#cha-50} That was
precisely the dilemma Washington confronted, and why his dealings with
an influential Harvard professor and regular Tuskegee contributor had to
be evasive. Among other letters to be answered at just that moment was
trustee Henry Villard's of June 28. Owner of [The Nation]{.epub-i} and
New York [Evening Post,]{.epub-i} former board chairman of the Northern
Pacific Railroad, and president of the company reorganized as General
Electric, Villard had been dismayed to receive a student's letter
thanking him for scholarship aid and the opportunity to study such
grown-up subjects as natural philosophy, ancient history, and civil
government at Tuskegee. ""You will remember,"" Villard admonished his
favorite Negro educator, ""that in a conversation with you when you were
our guest, I expressed a strong depreciation of the attempts made at the
Atlanta University to give young men and women of your race a regular
university education such as is obtained at the highest institutions of
learning in the North.""[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-51){#cha-51}
A professorship for a man like Du Bois would have struck men like
Villard as a subversion of the Tuskegee ideal. The job prospects for the
""best educated colored man"" (who was also among the best-educated
Americans) were dim.

The summer before going to Farmville, Du Bois and Nina had received a
visit at the CSA from the Yankee president of Atlanta University, Horace
Bumstead. Another kindly, Congregationalist Quixote, Bumstead was
guiding his beleaguered institution past the shoals of southern white
hostility represented by Tom Watson and northern white fecklessness [Ã 
la]{.epub-i} Henry Villard. Horace Bumstead was not a dynamic man but
there was Sheffield steel behind the parson's collar. Atlanta
University's academic standards were high, its curriculum having been
modeled on the New England college, and its community life was racially
integrated in a city whose phoenixlike rebirth symbolized the new
separate-but-equal South. Sitting with the Du Boises that hot summer
day, Bumstead warmed to the confident, quiet-spoken intellectual whose
career from Fisk onward he had followed with satisfaction. At the June
1895 meeting of Bumstead's trustees, Boston philanthropist George C.
Bradford had proposed an annual series of ""systematic and thorough
investigation\[s\] of the conditions of living among the Negro
population of cities,"" patterned on the Hampton and Tuskegee
conferences. Whereupon the aged professor of economics at Atlanta
University had dropped dead. Hart then had told Bradford (who sought a
second opinion from Harvard sociologist Edward Cummings), who in turn
told Bumstead that Atlanta University had to get Du Bois for his
faculty.[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-52){#cha-52} There was some
dodging about religious faith, Bumstead recalled. Du Bois ""seemed to be
one of those persons who, when asked about their religion, reply that
they 'have none to speak of.'"" Despite this, the Atlanta University
president decided that anyone living in the middle of a Negro slum with
his new bride evidenced ""genuine religion in that fact."" They shook
hands on a promise to leave the matter under active consideration. A
year later, shortly after posting the [Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i} piece
scheduled to appear in August 1897, Du Bois accepted the Atlanta
University professorship at one thousand dollars per annum, effective
July 9, with actual teaching not to begin until January
1898.[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-53){#cha-53}

""Strivings of the Negro People"" was in a sense Du Bois's national debut.
Until then, the literate public had known something of him largely
through hearsay or quick mentions in press accounts of commencement
exercises or learned society proceedings. When [Atlantic
Monthly]{.epub-i} subscribers read the August issue, few of them failed
to recognize that the African-American was beginning to find a new
voice, and subscribers like Henry Villard certainly disliked what they
were hearing. Almost two years were to elapse before Booker T.
Washington hired his first (incompetent) ghostwriter and another two
before white America would go gaga over Washington's racially reassuring
[Up From
Slavery.]{.epub-i}[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-54){#cha-54}
Meanwhile, the genteel white reading public encountered a troubling
essay the likes of which had not been seen before---not even from
Frederick Douglass's flaming pen. Forty-five years before there was a
name for it, Du Bois produced an existentialist essay, one in which
Herder seemed to nod at a yet undiscovered (for Du Bois) Freud.
""Strivings of the Negro People"" was startlingly personal. It abandoned
the controlled prose of [The Suppression of the African Slave
Trade]{.epub-i} and [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} (in progress) for
the indignation of the English 12 writings and the lyricism of the
student notebooks. ""Between me and the other world there is ever an
unasked question,"" he began, before giving the most unconventional
answer yet to the ""real question"" on the minds of white people, ""How
does it feel to be a problem?"" It was a ""strange experience,"" he said,
elegiacally recalling that first instance of searing rejection in the
Berkshire ""wee wooden schoolhouse"" when he was ""shut out from their
world by a vast veil.""[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-55){#cha-55}
But rather than sulk and wither behind it, Du Bois boasted of the
compensations of the veil, of holding ""all beyond it in common
contempt,"" and of living ""above it in a region of blue sky and great
wandering shadows""---bravura, meaning ""I could beat my mates at
examination-time, or beat them at a foot-race, or even beat their
stringy heads."" Solitary, destined, he would prevail through the sheer
strength of his own character and the power of his mind.

Du Bois projected his own personal dilemma---the gift or curse of
marginality---on to the group, thereby psychoanalytically defining for
at least a century the supposedly unique tension beneath
African-American racial identity. Whereas in ""The Conservation of Races""
there had been as many as eight races, he now numbered the Negro, ""after
the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and Mongolian,""
as a ""sort of seventh son, born with a veil and gifted with second-sight
in this American world."" ""It is a peculiar sensation, this sense of
always looking at one's self through the eyes of others,"" he wrote. ""One
ever feels his two-ness,---an American, a Negro; two souls, two
thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark
body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn
asunder.""[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-56){#cha-56} The
word-pictures of the ""history of this strife,"" of this ""waste of double
aims"" and the racial logic implicit in it, were meant to wrench emotion
and provoke thought from all of his audience, short of inveterate
Negrophobes. He wove a deft allusion to a past wholly unknown to white
readers: ""The shadow of a mighty Negro past flits through the tale of
Ethiopia the Shadowy and of Egypt the Sphinx."" He invoked the superhuman
strivings against a rigged American civilization, in which ""the powers
of single black men flash here and there like falling stars."" He
rehearsed the pathetic ingenuousness demonstrated by the self-improving
citizenship of the deceived ex-slave: ""So the decade flew away, the
revolution of 1876 came, and left the half-free serf weary, wondering,
but still inspired."" Du Bois moved on to underscore the black American's
belated perception that nothing tried, nothing aspired to, nothing
achieved much mattered to the white world: ""For the first time he sought
to analyze himself, and not another."" But the black American found
himself virtually bereft of the resources to act upon the new wisdom,
for ""to be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of
dollars is the very bottom of
hardships.""[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-57){#cha-57}

Before and after the Civil War, black thinkers and doers had implored
and denounced, embraced and renounced the American homeland, some of
them managing to embrace and renounce it simultaneously. Du Bois's
[Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i} jeremiads belonged to an old love-hate
tradition that included hundreds of speeches by Richard Allen and Martin
Delany, Frederick Douglass and Henry Turner, Robert Purvis and Alexander
Crummell. That tradition had traveled two antagonistic yet somehow
complementary paths of nationalism and integration, or cultural
chauvinism and assimilation. One led to the old lion Douglass on his
Cedar Hill estate above Washington, white second wife by his side,
roaring, ""Assimilation not isolation is our true policy and our natural
destiny."" The other path led to James Holly struggling in Haiti and
Delany negotiating a chimerical cotton empire in the Niger Valley. In a
jest that said everything about the dual track, Douglass once remarked
that he thanked God for simply making him a man, ""but Delany always
thanks Him for making him a black
man.""[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-58){#cha-58} For Du Bois, the
joke was on both. The breakthrough of ""Strivings of the Negro People""
was to offer a third path, a dialectical solution predicated as much
upon the logic of antithesis as impelled by the predicament of its
author's own marginality.

Double sighted, double conscious, the African-American must neither
reject America nor vanish into it. This truly novel (Crummell-derived)
concept of race in America Du Bois extolled in language of great staying
power:

In this merging he wishes neither of the older selves to be lost. He
would not Africanize America, for America has too much to teach the
world and Africa. He would not bleach his Negro soul in a flood of white
Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world.
He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an
American, without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without
losing the opportunity of self-development \[without having the doors of
opportunity closed roughly in his
face\].[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-59){#cha-59}

A further, final surprise for [Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i} readers of
this supercharged essay was the author's reservations about the unnamed
Booker Washington's educational and civil rights bargain at Atlanta.
""The training of the schools we need today more than ever,"" Du Bois
wrote in closing, ""the training of deft hands, quick eyes and ears and
the broader, deeper, higher culture of gifted minds."" Then came the
final taboo. ""The power of the ballot we need in sheer self-defense....
Work, culture, liberty---all these we need, not singly but together,
gained through the unifying ideal of
Race.""[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-60){#cha-60} When this
warning flare reappeared six years later, retitled and slightly
retouched as ""Of Our Spiritual Strivings,"" it was as the opening salvo
in [The Souls of Black Folk.]{.epub-i}

Du Bois must have vacated the pestilential Seventh Ward in late summer
of 1897 for more congenial quarters in which to lodge the family and
press the writing of [The Philadelphia Negro. Gopsill's Philadelphia
City Directory]{.epub-i} for 1898 lists Du Bois, W E. B., ""physician""
(meaning, of course, Dr. Du Bois), at 2325 St. Alban's Place. Burghardt
Gomer, the miraculous infant, probably arrived with Nina from Great
Barrington in late October. The two-story brick St. Alban's house was
narrow and not large but grand in comparison with the Lombard Street
room. It stood roughly in the middle of what was actually a charming
alley that stretched between two cast iron fountains. Both parents doted
on Burghardt, a large boy with spun-gold hair, large eyes, and his
mother's mouth. Nina doted on him out of maternal love and pride; and Du
Bois did so out of paternal devotion but also because of the
significance he believed his son held for the future of the race and
history. Musing above Burghardt's ""little white bed,"" the father saw
""the strength of \[his\] own arm stretched onward through the ages
through the newer strength of
his.""[[61]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-61){#cha-61}

[The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} was remarkable as an example of the
new empiricism that was fundamentally transforming the social sciences
at the beginning of the twentieth century. Although Du Bois's novel
sociological insights would soon become conventional wisdom, as one of
the last books of the nineteenth century and the first of the twentieth
century, the Philadelphia study would be a breakthrough achievement, an
important and virtually solitary departure from the hereditarian
theorizing of the times. The armchair cerebrations of sociology's great
nineteenth-century system builders---Auguste Comte, Karl Marx, and
Herbert Spencer---would continue to inform, challenge, and inspire, but
the watchword of the discipline was becoming [investigation,]{.epub-i}
followed by induction---facts before
theory.[[62]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-62){#cha-62} More than any
other leading American sociologist during the decade after 1898, Du Bois
undertook for a time the working out of an authentic objectivity in
social science, ""to put science into sociology through a study of the
conditions and problems of \[his\] own
group.""[[63]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-63){#cha-63} It was a
methodology a student of Schmoller's was superbly equipped to advance
just six years after the founding at the new University of Chicago of
the first department of sociology in the United States.

Unlike Spencer's colossal [Social Statics,]{.epub-i} whose tenth and
final volume appeared in 1896, [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} tended
to understate its major premises, inserting them unobtrusively between
data and analysis. Loyal to James's principles of psychology and
Schmoller's inductive methodology, Du Bois's was among the first to
break ranks with Spencerian sociology's analogizing of social processes
to the laws of chemistry and genetics. ""In the realm of social phenomena
the law of survival is greatly modified by human choice, wish, whim and
prejudice,"" Du Bois
contended.[[64]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-64){#cha-64}
Significantly, the founder of what became known as the Chicago School of
sociology, Albion W. Small, had also studied at Berlin with Schmoller.
Despite a good deal of manifesto prose in Small's brand-new [American
Journal of Sociology]{.epub-i} about scientific ""restraint,"" avoidance
of ""premature sociological opinion,"" and the like, the canon of
empirically derived knowledge was as sinned against as it was obeyed.
Small and Franklin Giddings, Columbia's founding sociology chairman, as
well as Edward Ross at Wisconsin, were all given to extreme prejudices
about immigrants, blacks, and women. For the arbitral Giddings, a
primordial ""consciousness of kind"" forever determined relations between
groups in society. Had the now lost ""Sociology Hesitant"" been published
when it was completed sometime after 1900, Du Bois would have left an
even more impressive record as a theoretical pacesetter. This bold essay
challenged the giants of contemporary sociology and declared that the
discipline's methodology was based on theoretical fallacies that ignored
the ineradicable element of chance in human affairs. He, too, saw the
""action of physical law in the actions of men,"" the young sociologist
wrote, but, unlike Comte's ignoring of human will, Spencer's ""verbal
juggery,"" and Giddings's ""gross abstractions,"" he saw ""more than that.""
What Du Bois believed he saw were ""rhythms and tendencies; coincidences
and probabilities."" Out of what William James would soon call a
""blooming, buzzing confusion"" Du Bois wrested two fundamental rhythms of
social behavior---a ""primary"" and a ""secondary."" Primary rhythms were
governed by physical laws ([viz.,]{.epub-i} birth and death rates);
secondary rhythms (""presenting nearly the same uniformity"") were
controlled by volition. ""To confound the two sorts of human uniformity
is fatal to clear thinking,"" Du Bois claimed as he served up a
definition of his field: ""sociology, then, is the science that seeks
\[to measure\] the limits of Chance in human conduct."" But even he may
have had second thoughts on the threshold of professional acclaim about
publishing what amounted to an arraignment of the leading lights of his
discipline. Conceivably, Du Bois may have intended to retrieve
""Sociology Hesitant"" from a drawer for a more timely appearance, only to
decide that what had once been cutting-edge lucidity was becoming
conventional sociological
wisdom.[[65]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-65){#cha-65}

In [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} and the later Atlanta University
Studies, Du Bois strove to avoid apriority, to generalize cautiously
only after questionnaires, census records, government archives, and
cross-cultural data and the rest had been digested. ""The problem lay
before me,"" he explained. ""Study it. I studied it personally and not
just by proxy. I sent out no canvassers. I went myself.... I went
through the Philadelphia libraries for data, gained access in many
instances to private libraries of colored folk.... I mapped the
district, classifying it by conditions."" But there were a few instances
of substantial help provided by others, as with Eaton's industrial data
and the surveillance of Seventh Ward taverns by a class from the
university. Anticipating the perspective commended by Max Weber, Du Bois
bracketed the Philadelphia problem in a two-hundred-year time frame in
order to give causal and evolutionary context to the contemporary
Seventh Ward. Because sociology was history abstracted, it followed that
""one cannot study the Negro in freedom and come to general conclusions
about his destiny without knowing his history in
slavery.""[[66]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-66){#cha-66} [The
Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} recounted the ascent through slavery and
adversity by late-seventeenth-century Africans in the city until their
progress was sharply checked, temporarily, by European migration in the
mid-nineteenth; then through their rise and fall again later in the
century---due, in part, to an influx of southern black folk. ""Thus we
see,"" Du Bois wrote, consciously evoking Roman history, ""that twiceÂ ...
through the migration of barbarians a dark age has settled on \[their\]
age of revival.""[[67]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-67){#cha-67}

Other ethnic groups have passed through cycles of socioeconomic
adjustment and mobility, but what made them chronically and
fundamentally different for the African-American, Du Bois observed
cogently, was the interplay of race and economics. This comparative
historical dimension in [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} gave its
interpretations exceptional force---as when detailing the rigged hand
dealt African-Americans during the Industrial Revolution:

Here was a mass of black workmen of whom very few were by previous
training fitted to become the mechanics and artisans of a new industrial
development; but here, too, were an increasing mass of foreigners and
native Americans who were unusually well fitted to take part in the new
industries; finally, most people were willing and many eager that
Negroes should be kept as menial servants rather than develop into
industrial factors.... Let them stagger
downward.[[68]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-68){#cha-68}

Readers were reminded repeatedly, sometimes in tones less than neutral,
how the factor of race had played out over time differently for black
people and white people: ""... the difference is that the ancestors of
the English and the Irish and the Italians were felt to be worth
educating, helping and guiding because they were men and
brothers.""[[69]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-69){#cha-69} Many of
today's urban scholars insist on the concept of urban ""arrival time"" as
a more objective explanation of the African-American's troubled
adjustment as the last group to reach the industrial city, thereby
diminishing the importance of the factor of
racism.[[70]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-70){#cha-70} Du Bois might
have been intrigued, but he would undoubtedly have replied that such
hypotheses erroneously substituted chronology for causality, reminding
them that long before the post-industrial city arrived, ""no differences
of social condition allowed any Negro to escape from the group, although
such escape was continually the rule among Irish, Germans, and other
whites.""[[71]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-71){#cha-71}

The comparative approach had definite advantages though. Du Bois
compared black Philadelphia death rates with those of Austrians,
Hungarians, and Italians in Europe and concluded that the former,
although high, were ""not extraordinarily so."" Returning to the same
scene nearly eighty years later, however, the massive, numbers-crunching
Philadelphia Social History Project of the University of Pennsylvania
described the mortality rate among Philadelphia's black males as
""fierce,"" and determined that half the African-American women with
children in the 1880s were
widows.[[72]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-72){#cha-72} Similarly, when
he took a multiethnic look at criminal behavior, Du Bois's
social-science rigor sometimes faltered before his Victorian values. He
counted a total of fifty-three prostitutes for the entire Seventh Ward,
even though the [Inquirer]{.epub-i} reported forty-eight being flushed
on one night from a single alley two blocks from Lombard Street. On the
one hand, taking comfort from comparisons, he found that ""crime is
rampant but not more so, if as much, as in Italy."" The fundamental point
was that Irish and Italians had been privileged in Philadelphia in a way
African-Americans never had because ""they were men and
brothers.""[[73]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-73){#cha-73} On the other
hand, Du Bois's tabulations of crime in black and white revealed the
appalling fact that 22.5 percent of Philadelphia's robberies,
burglaries, assaults, and homicides had been perpetrated by 4 percent of
its people after 1889---up dramatically from a 14-percent rate before
1890. Italians were [hors de
combat.]{.epub-i}[[74]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-74){#cha-74}

If sociologists were historians, Du Bois also thought of them as being
analogous to archeologists, who dig until reaching the bedrock of
organized human behavior. A curious and paradoxical consequence sprang
from this conviction, however. On the one hand, Du Bois's volume carried
the vivid narrative power that other urban studies would lack until
Robert and Helen Lynd's enormously popular [Middletown]{.epub-i} series
more than thirty years in the future. [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i}
was as ""interesting as a novel, thanks to the skill with which the
author has worked his material,"" the review in [City and State]{.epub-i}
would applaud. Du Bois wrote graphically of money and manners in
""fourteen bawdy houses,"" of individual and institutional accomplishments
of the ""better classes,"" of stoic pertinacity and worn-out failure among
the hardworking poor, of hovels in infamous Gillis's Alley worse than
anything in the plantation South, and of an exceptional decision by the
Pennsylvania Railroad to promote ""one bright and persistent porter to a
clerkship, which he has held for
years.""[[75]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-75){#cha-75} But on the
other hand, barely a single family among the 2,500 households
meticulously interviewed was granted a voice in the monograph, except
for a string of disembodied quotes in the chapter dealing with
employment. No statements from pensive mothers, tired fathers, or
children not yet dulled inform it. The history and sociology of their
conditions interested Du Bois, not their individual, bruised-flesh
lives. What the Philadelphia Negro thought about present and future
Philadelphia he or she was not invited to say. It would be to inflict
the fallacy of presentism, however, to fault Du Bois for his disinterest
in teasing more of the personal out of his impressive field research.
Almost twenty years would elapse before William I. Thomas and Florian
Znaniecki produced their monumental [The Polish Peasant in Europe and
America,]{.epub-i} teeming with the voices of struggling men and
women.[[76]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-76){#cha-76} Still, it is
hard not to regret the missed opportunity to hear the active voice of
the people of the Seventh Ward.

Because Du Bois wrote in a manner generally designed to disclose rather
than volubly to underscore his unorthodox sociological theories, most
reviewers would laud the thorough scholarship of [The Philadelphia
Negro]{.epub-i} but overlook its radical subtext completely. Much of the
monograph calculatedly lent itself to one-sided, unthreatening
interpretations; and besides, Lindsay had taken care to send Du Bois's
preliminary research plans to Booker Washington for
reassurance.[[77]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-77){#cha-77}
Paternalist generalities abounded, such as: ""the Negro is as a rule,
willing, honest and good-natured, but he is also, as a rule, careless,
unreliable and unsteady."" Even when writing of the ""aristocracy of the
Negro population,"" the author noted ""here and there..., too, some faint
trace of careless moral training."" Describing the people at the bottom
of the Seventh Ward heap as a ""class of criminals, prostitutes and
loafers,"" he coined a memorably dismissive phrase---""the submerged
tenth."" The famous term ""talented tenth"" would come later, but the
notion that elites (black as well as white) were the purifying, moving
force in history was stated over and again---because a nation ""can only
be understood and finally judged by its upper
class.""[[78]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-78){#cha-78}

Portions of chapter 28, ""A Final Word,"" might have been written by Yale
sociologist William Graham Sumner, whose antiwelfare nostrums were soon
to make him a household name. His investigative forbearance taxed beyond
measure by the level of crime in the Seventh Ward, Du Bois served notice
of retribution: ""Simply because the ancestors of the present white
inhabitants of America went out of their way barbarously to mistreat and
enslave the ancestors of the present black inhabitants, gives those
blacks no right to ask that the civilization and morality of the land be
seriously menaced for their benefit."" If they were not yet up to
""complete civilization"" thirty years after slavery, African-Americans
could still be expected to ""make themselves fit members of the community
within a reasonable length of time."" And, ""finally,"" on a note that was
worthy of Booker Washington, ""the Negroes must cultivate a spirit of
calm, patient persistence in their attitude toward their fellow
citizens.""[[79]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-79){#cha-79}

The unsigned reviews in [The Nation, The Literary Digest,]{.epub-i} and
[The Outlook]{.epub-i} were typical of the establishmentarian response
to [The Philadelphia Negro,]{.epub-i} allowance made for the decision of
the [American Journal of Sociology]{.epub-i} to ignore the monograph
completely. ""A very exhaustive study,"" [The Nation]{.epub-i} decreed,
commending it to readers for ""the lesson taught by this
investigationÂ ... of patience and sympathy toward the South, whose
difficulties have been far greater than those of the North."" Concurring,
[The Literary Digest]{.epub-i} decided that the book proved the southern
business wisdom of Booker Washington, while [The Outlook]{.epub-i}
approvingly noted that Du Bois made no attempt ""to bend the facts so as
to plead for his race."" In its comprehensive treatment, [The American
Historical Review]{.epub-i} rejoiced that the author was ""perfectly
frank, laying all necessary stress on the weakness of his people.""
Calling for more studies based on Du Bois's excellent model, the
reviewer urged that they not fail to examine the ""effects of the mixing
of blood of very different
races.""[[80]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-80){#cha-80}

Assessments of [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} such as these were
probably exactly what CSA backers like Wharton, Harrison, Lindsay, and
Ogden had hoped for. With the book's publication in the fall of 1899,
the good-government reformers had a full quiver of arrows to wield in
the next electoral skirmish with the hated Republican machine and its
Negro minions. In that sense, Du Bois had fulfilled his part of the
bargain. He had even shared the limelight with Eaton by accepting her
eighty-two-page ""Special Report on Negro Domestic Service in the Seventh
Ward"" as the book's concluding section. Summarizing her tight analysis
based on Du Bois's schedules, Eaton condemned most domestic labor as
dull, dead-end, and racially circumscribed. Citing the new monograph on
the subject by her radical feminist mentor, Lucy Salmon, she advocated
profit sharing between employer and domestic as a
remedy.[[81]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-81){#cha-81} If the
inclusion of Eaton's monograph was a concession to Wharton, and in any
way displeased Du Bois, there is no indication of it in his
correspondence. It was an unusually generous thing for him to have done,
whatever the motives---respect and affection for Eaton, feminist
solidarity, or University of Pennsylvania politics. Although her
contribution was solid and useful, neither as a piece of research nor as
literature does it complement Du Bois's majestic text. It would have
been more appropriate relegated to the appendices.

But Du Bois had written equally for white and black readers who could
read between the lines of Victorian cant and could reason beyond the
problems of a single ward in a large American city---readers capable of
""a fair basis of induction as to the present condition of the American
Negro."" It was the other [Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} that Du Bois
hoped would be appreciated by generations of scholars and would
influence, as it has, works such as the monumental [Black
Metropolis]{.epub-i} of Horace Cayton and St. Clair Drake, the family
studies of E. Franklin Frazier and Patrick Moynihan, and to serve as a
model for the classic [An American
Dilemma.]{.epub-i}[[82]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-82){#cha-82}
Intent on reading into Du Bois the sanctioning of the Atlanta
Compromise, [The Nation, The American Historical Review,]{.epub-i} and
most other review publications virtually ignored the novel triad of
race-class-economics on which the Philadelphia study was erected. Race
prejudice was not the cause of all that was disadvantaged,
dysfunctional, and dismal in the history of the Negro, Du Bois readily
conceded, but ""on the other hand, it is a far more powerful social force
than most Philadelphians realize."" The racially disproportionate crime
rate that he deplored owed much to feeble group morality, but crime was
at bottom symptomatic of systemic ills. ""The social environment of
excuse, listless despair, careless indulgence and lack of inspiration to
work is the growing force that turns black boys and girls into gamblers,
prostitutes and rascals."" Du Bois made it clear that the surrounding
white community was responsible for these conditions---""How long can a
city teach its black children that the road to success is to have a
white face?""[[83]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-83){#cha-83}

In a single, seminal statement, he collapsed the entire superstructure
of the monograph---schedules, charts, books, and all---onto its
foundation: ""A glance at the tables shows how much more sensitive the
lower classes of a population are to the great social changes than the
rest of the group.""[[84]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-84){#cha-84}
Reviewers who thought that [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} blamed
poverty, crime, and indolence on Philadelphia's Negroes had obviously
skipped over chapter 16. Katherine Davis, who had left the Lombard
Street house to write her doctoral dissertation at the University of
Chicago by the time [The Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} appeared, was one
of the first reviewers to give it its economic due, writing that it
""recognizes the economic side of the problem as that which presents at
the same time the greatest importance and the greatest
difficulties.""[[85]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-85){#cha-85} A
careful reading of the same chapter 16, with its Puritan assault on
sloth and ignorance, revealed that Du Bois reduced the complexities of
the ""Negro Problem""---the feeble family structure, cultural
underdevelopment, poverty, disease, and crime---to their social and
economic underpinnings. It was white racism that made the black
experience different and increasingly dysfunctional, readers were told.
Du Bois's prose soared on Progressive currents:

Such discrimination is morally wrong, politically dangerous,
industrially wasteful, and socially silly. It is the duty of the whites
to stop it, and to do so primarily for their own sakes. Industrial
freedom of opportunity has by long experience been proven to be
generally best for all. Moreover the cost of crime and pauperism, the
growth of slums, and the pernicious influences of idleness and lewdness,
cost the public far more than would the hurt to the feelings of a
carpenter to work beside a black man, or a shop-girl to start beside a
darker mate. This does not contemplate the wholesale replacing of white
workmen before Negroes out of sympathy or philanthropy; it does mean
that talent should be rewarded, and aptness used in commerce and
industry whether its owner be black or
white.[[86]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-86){#cha-86}

But if white leaders had their work cut out for them, so did their
African-American counterparts. Opportunity meant responsibility, and Du
Bois's research established that above the seemingly amorphous mass
there existed a cohesive, responsible elite to offer guidance. Before it
was identified and described in [The Philadelphia Negro,]{.epub-i} the
class structure of Afro-America was mostly unknown, utterly mysterious,
and even widely assumed as nonexistent. Most white people supposed that
the periodic appearance of exceptional or ""representative"" black people
was due to providence, ""mixed blood,"" or some mysterious current passing
through a dark, undifferentiated mass. Otherwise, there were only good
Negroes and bad ones.[[87]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-87){#cha-87}
Du Bois introduced white readers to four ubiquitous classes or ""grades""
of African-Americans (found equally in Philadelphia, Boston, or
Farmville). First came the ""aristocracy"" (some 277 families numbering
approximately 3,000 persons among Philadelphia's 40,000
African-Americans), described as ""families of undoubted respectability,
earning sufficient income to live well; not engaged in menial service of
any kind."" Next, there were families of the ""respectable working class,""
or the ""representative Negroes,"" with ""steady remunerative workÂ ...
\[and\] younger children in school."" Grade three consisted of the
working poor---""honest, although not always energetic or
thrifty.""[[88]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-88){#cha-88} Finally,
there was the ""lowest class,"" Du Bois's ""submerged tenth.""

Two aspects of class analysis spelled out in [The Philadelphia
Negro]{.epub-i} were to govern Du Bois's thinking for many years ahead.
First, that the advancement of the race was driven by a minuscule elite
whose mainstream standards and goals must be deferred to by the
majority. ""In many respects it is right and proper to judge a people by
its best classes,"" he insisted, ""rather than by its worst classes or
middle ranks."" More than that, Du Bois predicted that this class was
""itself an answer to the question of the ability of the Negro to
assimilate American culture""---rather a different note of concern from
that sounded in his [Atlantic Monthly]{.epub-i}
essay.[[89]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-89){#cha-89} He acutely
regretted, therefore, that the elites had faltered in their leadership
role and ""segregate\[d\] themselves from the mass."" Second, Du Bois
affirmed that the family structure, work ethic, and class behavior of
African-Americans was still deeply embedded in the experience and
culture of slavery. Although his research indicated that most black
families were nuclear---headed by two parents---and that their
instability was not markedly different, statistically, from that of
Philadelphia's immigrant German, Italian, or Irish families during the
1890s (a finding reconfirmed later by the Philadelphia Social History
Project), Du Bois unhesitatingly ascribed much of the blame for the
deviant 25 percent to the ""lax moral habits of the slave regime
\[which\] still show themselves in a large amount of cohabitation
without marriage."" The seeds of the future social-pathology schools of
urban and ethnic studies inhered in this
interpretation.[[90]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-90){#cha-90}

In chapter 16, ""The Contact of the Races,"" Du Bois combined the practice
of speaking for his subjects with quotations exposing routine white
bigotry. They piled up page after page, with little comment from the
author. ""D------ 'Your work is very good,' they said to her, 'but if we
hired you all our ladies would leave.'"" ""M------ is a good typesetter;
he has not been allowed to join the union and has been refused work at
eight different places in the city."" ""'I wouldn't have a darky to clean
out my store, much less to stand behind the counter,' answered one
druggist."" ""H------ was a brickmason, but his employers finally refused
to let him lay brick as his fellow workmen were all white; he is now a
waiter.""[[91]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-91){#cha-91} When Du Bois
finally wound up this catalogue of discrimination, the causal linkage of
race and class to economics was unmistakable. Du Bois had ended by
driving home his point, writing feelingly: ""For thirty years and more
Philadelphia has said to its black children: 'Honesty, efficiency and
talent have little to do with your success; if you work hard, spend
little and are good you may earn your bread and butter at those sorts of
work which we frankly confess we despise; if you are dishonest and lazy,
the State will furnish your bread
free.""[[92]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-92){#cha-92}

Buttoning up his indignation once more, he brought his great, schizoid
monograph to a close with two more chapters. With so many plaudits for
all sorts of ulterior, superficial, and irrelevant reasons, Du Bois must
have been gratified by [Yale Review']{.epub-i}s praise of [The
Philadelphia Negro]{.epub-i} as ""a credit to American scholarship, and a
distinct and valuable addition to the world's stock of knowledge
concerning an important and obscure theme."" That fitting tribute---to
work that should have placed him among the most promising young
sociologists in America---would be echoed in Albion Small's [American
Journal of Sociology,]{.epub-i} where Du Bois's remarkable Atlanta
University Studies would soon receive a single, brief
commendation.[[93]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter8-93){#cha-93}

[Fisk and Josie's World]{.epub-bi}

E[VEN THOUGH]{.epub-sc} he always minimized the role that Great
Barrington's African-American community had played in his growing up,
Willie's knowledge of the larger world of black people---and especially
of southern black people---was as indirect and negligible as he said it
was. Western Massachusetts was an incomparably kinder place, racially,
in which to grow up than the lynch-law backwaters and scabrous townships
that were home to most of the young men and women who came to Fisk
University. The mighty clan of Burghardts along with the immigrants
pouring into the AME Zion church went about their interracial lives with
a relaxed deference, modest ambition, and subdued group awareness---in
stark contrast to the cagey anger, professional strivings, and racial
chauvinism common to many of the southerners Willie was to meet. The
South was alien and mysterious---a place of dread for black people in
the North. Yet the year's wait to go off to college, the repressed,
half-examined feelings Mary Silvina's death provoked, the heady
responsibilities and contacts in connection with Searles Castle, the
subtle social exclusions---that veil he later described so
poignantly---all made Willie eager for the South, for a group of young
people of his ""own race,"" and for an end to the ""spiritual isolation"" in
which he was living.[[1]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-1){#cha-1}

Fisk Free Colored School had opened on the site of the Union army
hospital in south Nashville in early 1866, three American Missionary
Association officers pledging on their own authority the
four-thousand-dollar down payment for twenty low, narrow, windowless
frame buildings jammed into a small rectangle near Chattanooga depot.
Two hundred ex-slaves, men, women, and children, came to learn to read,
write, and count on the first day. By February, six hundred clamored for
instruction. A year later, a thousand a day were being spelled by the
dedicated men and women of the AMA and the Tennessee department of the
Freedmen's Bureau, headed by General Clinton Bowen Fisk, a former
colonel of a regiment of Negro troops. Ragged and mostly jobless, they
advanced upon Nashville like a leaderless army from great distances and
remote places to master the rudimentary knowledge that, denied on pain
of corporal punishment until then, every one of them knew held the key
to the white man's power. Webster's [Blue-Backed Speller,]{.epub-i}
McGuffey's [Reader,]{.epub-i} Davis's [Primary Arithmetic,]{.epub-i} and
General Fisk's [Plain Counsels for Freedmen]{.epub-i} were talismans of
far greater immediacy and import to these men, women, and children than
recent and pending amendments of the federal constitution. ""Those were
wonderful days, directly after the war,"" ex-slave Booker Taliaferro
Washington recalled. ""Suddenly, as if at the sound of a trumpet, a whole
race that had been slumbering for centuriesÂ ... awoke and started off
one morning for school.""[[2]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-2){#cha-2}

In August 1867 principal John Ogden, former lieutenant of the 2nd
Wisconsin Cavalry, renamed the school Fisk University, ambitiously
laying on coeducational instruction above the primary grades. A
Congregationalist warrior captured and interned in Tennessee until the
end of the Civil War, Ogden was typical of the best of the Freedmen's
Bureau---selfless, commanding, appalled by social evil, and unabashedly
visionary about the capacities of the ex-slaves. During his three years
at Fisk, he established a school of theology to prepare the first
generation of black Congregationalist preachers. He set on course a
model high school and a ""normal"" school to train teachers to man the
South's sketchy public school systems, the first graduates---twelve in
number---going forth in 1869. When Reverend Barnas Sears, general agent
for the new southern-oriented Peabody Fund, visited that year, he was
pleased to recommend eight hundred dollars for Ogden's institution in
preference to Berea College, another Kentucky AMA school, praising Fisk
as ""the best normal school"" he had seen. Fisk's masters discreetly
noted, however, the implications for Fisk of the fact that Berea had
prejudiced the Peabody agent by actively encouraging the enrollment of
black students.[[3]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-3){#cha-3}

When Ogden left the ""university"" in 1870, its academic prospects were as
bright as its financial health was dim, despite careful economizing and
sporadic philanthropy. The situation was saved by another
Congregationalist warrior, George L. White, veteran of bloody Gettysburg
and Chancellorsville and former staff officer to General Fisk, who
served as the school's pugnacious business manager. Something of an
amateur musician, White listened spellbound whenever he happened upon
groups of students relaxing in songs from slavery times. It was his
decision that Fisk should literally sing itself into permanence. Going
forth from their first autumn 1871 success in Reverend Henry Ward
Beecher's influential Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn (hidden
in a loft so that white parishioners heard their voices before seeing
their faces), the school's Jubilee Singers enthralled audiences in
Boston (Johann Strauss joyously tossed his hat in the air), London,
Paris, Berlin, and much of Europe, with presidents, prime ministers, and
royals vying for their presence at special occasions. ""I heard them sing
once,"" Mark Twain wrote an English friend, ""and I would walk seven miles
to hear them sing again.""[[4]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-4){#cha-4}
Known informally as ""Beecher's Nigger Minstrels,"" these eleven poised,
handsome men and women called themselves after that jubilant, momentous
day at war's end when slaves received news of their freedom. [Jubilee
Songs: As Sung by the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University,]{.epub-i}
Theodore Seward's best-selling compilation, appeared in 1872. These were
the ""Sorrow Songs"" Du Bois would write of in his pioneering essay. The
enormous popularity of the new ""Negro spirituals"" enabled White's
students to earn on several tours more than ninety thousand dollars,
enough to cover the college's debts, buy a new campus site north of the
city, and erect Jubilee Hall, a massive, bell-towered, all-purpose
Victorian structure of grey
brick.[[5]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-5){#cha-5}

Thirteen years and one principal later, Willie Du Bois came to the
nation's most famous college for the uplift of his people. Erastus Milo
Cravath was now president, a towering, bearded authority figure out of
the Old Testament, whose upstate New York parents had been ""conductors""
on the Underground Railroad before moving to Oberlin, Ohio, where young
Cravath received his divinity degree. Intellectually, President Cravath
appears to have been somewhat slow, finding his way, Willie said, in
""intricate and involved"" sentences that usually fatigued student
listeners until the approach of the inevitable inspirational conclusion.
Former chaplain to the 101st Regiment of Ohio Volunteers, President
Cravath unfailingly greeted students with a sweeping military
salute.[[6]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-6){#cha-6} With one admired
African-American exception, the faculty of fifteen, like former
regimental chaplain Cravath himself, was white, northern, deeply
religious, overwhelmingly Congregationalist, and of impeccable
abolitionist credentials. As admission standards steadily rose in the
two decades after Fisk's founding, the number of students fell,
stabilizing at about 450 by 1885. Ably assisted by his dean, former
University of Michigan Greek scholar Adam K. Spence, President Cravath
had almost achieved his goal of transforming Fisk University into a
solid liberal arts college, among the best, in fact, in a part of the
nation where antebellum standards attained in higher education had never
been especially rigorous. Cravath and Spence were set upon quickly and
uncompromisingly, making Fisk the flagship school of AMA higher
education. When the department of college studies enrolled four
full-time degree candidates as early as 1871, the first such students
among the twenty-odd new southern colleges for African-Americans, that
ambition bounded forward.[[7]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-7){#cha-7}

Now that the federal troops were gone with the Compromise of 1877, those
who spoke for the ""redeemed"" South deplored such higher education
experiments at Fisk, Atlanta University, Talladega, and other lonely
enclaves of black schooling as worse than misguided. Their mean-spirited
objections were far different from the qualms of Ralph Waldo Emerson,
who exclaimed when handed its first catalog, ""Atlanta University? There
is no institution in this country that comes anywhere near being a
university except Harvard""---adding upon reflection, ""and that does not
really deserve the title.""[[8]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-8){#cha-8}
The new social and economic order emerging in the Bourbon South was
based on racial subservience. Higher education---Latin, philosophy,
science, and history---was denounced as an academic perversion inimical
to that order. But Fisk ignored the doubters and defamers. Superintended
by pious Dean Spence, the college curriculum made no formal concessions
either to the cultural deficits of its students, who were the first of
their race born out of slavery, or to the second-class citizenship
awaiting them in the emerging apartheid of an angry white South. ""If the
Negro is inferior to whites, give him superior training,"" Adam Spence
would twit white southerners didactically; ""if he is superior, give him
inferior training; but if equal, give him the
same.""[[9]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-9){#cha-9}

Spence and his colleagues were giving students Greek, Latin, French, and
German, theology, natural sciences, music, moral philosophy, and history
when Willie arrived in September 1885, entering the sophomore class at
the age of seventeen because of his superior northern secondary
education. Professors like Dean Spence's Michigan-trained brother-in-law
Frederick A. Chase, who taught chemistry and physics ""in a funny little
basement,"" Helen Morgan from Oberlin, the first woman appointed full
professor in a coeducational institution in the country (she chose Fisk
over Vassar as the place of her life's work in Latin), and Henry S.
Bennett, another Oberlinian, who taught German and served as college
pastor (a Quaker suspected of having a sense of humor), made the
learning experience in the college's small classes tonic and memorable.
""Splendid"" Dean Spence (Du Bois's words), who bore an uncanny physical
resemblance to fellow Scot Andrew Carnegie, taught them to ""know what
the Greek language meant,"" and President Cravath, in chapel and class,
saw to their souls and morals as solicitously as his own parents had
ministered to fugitive slaves on the last leg of their flight to
Canada.[[10]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-10){#cha-10} Except for
Atlanta University, its Congregationalist rival, no other four-year
institution in the South was so adequately committed to and as
consistently successful in producing African-American versions of New
England ladies and gentlemen---Black Puritans or Afro-Saxons, as they
were sometimes half mockingly
called.[[11]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-11){#cha-11}

Willie Du Bois plunged into this world with gusto. In the first place,
he arrived with a sense of mission almost as exalted as that of his AMA
teachers. As the train out of New York's Grand Central Terminal dropped
below the Mason-Dixon Line past West Virginia and Kentucky, his
fascination and excitement mounted at each whistle-stop as speech became
slower, skin colors proliferated across the spectrum from alabaster to
burnt cork, and the complex etiquette of race relations became
increasingly flammable. Willie says nothing about accommodations aboard
his train, but segregation in interstate travel was already being
imposed. Tennessee, in fact, had been the first state to enact race
separation laws in travel and public accommodation. That had been in
1881, and two years later, by its fateful invalidation of the Civil
Rights Act of 1875 in all matters state and local, the Supreme Court of
the United States handed 90 percent of the African-American population
over to the discretionary mercies of southern legislatures and
courts.[[12]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-12){#cha-12} Not unlikely,
then, when his future roommate during the three years at Fisk clambered
aboard at Bowling Green, Kentucky, neatly dressed, friendly Otho Porter
joined Willie in a Jim Crow car. But if so, this first brush with
segregation failed to dampen the exhilaration, novelty, and sense of
predestination Willie felt upon entering ""the land of slaves"" and seeing
for the first time his crooning great-grandmother's Africa, transplanted
and thriving, and bound to him from then on ""by new and exciting and
eternal ties.""[[13]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-13){#cha-13}

Fisk brought a three-year high that began in earnest the evening of the
first day on campus. Moving into the new men's dormitory named after the
explorer David Livingstone, a grey brick building on five acres of
magnolias, he met, one after another, persons of a class and bearing
amazing to him. They strode about confidently, most of them modishly
dressed, speaking to people they met with an easy gaze and ready tongue.
Even so, most of them came from conditions close to poverty, whether
genteel or hardworking; some, like studious Margaret Murray, from homes
where a single, breadwinning mother stroked seven sacrificial days a
week in the river of domestic service. Willie remembered ""coarse-looking
Sherrod, poor and slow,"" who, like roommate Porter, went on to become a
successful physician in
Mississippi.[[14]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-14){#cha-14} The sons
and daughters of slaves and slave masters, few of them displayed servile
traits because, to the extent advantages flowed from it, they were
beneficiaries of the slave system. Few came directly from farming
backgrounds, and the parents of those who did owned more than a few
acres. Their fathers were preachers, barbers, undertakers, and caterers,
and, as often, the privileged domestic and sole doctor or pharmacist in
a small town. These students hailed from the South's cities---from
Birmingham, Nashville, Louisville, Galveston---and from its medium-sized
towns---Sparta, Pine Bluff, Waycross. Their contact with white people
had usually been far more restricted than Willie's and seldom social in
character---formalized, governed in the workplace and forum by an
inviolable etiquette. Whereas Willie's intellectual and social growth
had depended upon and led him into ever-closer contact with Great
Barrington's white community, the educational and social advancement of
his Fisk classmates had largely depended on the extent to which they had
been insulated from local whites. They had learned their algebra and
sentence diagramming in one-room schoolhouses and academies in church
basements whose academic standards were a far cry from those at GBHS.

But not all were poor, especially those in the highly selective college
department. Dancing off a pinhead of privilege, the sons and daughters
of affluent Afro-America came to Fisk, as they did to Atlanta,
Talladega, Howard, Lincoln, and a handful of other colleges, in such
numbers that, although never in the majority, they set the tone and
defined the institutional character---a tone and character that,
although curiously imitative of the cavalier and lady of the Old South,
had no truck with antebellum values when it came to racial rights.
Willie was bedazzled by the likes of Ransom C. Edmondson and his younger
brother, elegant sons of a white planter; by the unnamed relative of a
future U.S. president, chauffeured to campus daily; by studious Thomas
J. Calloway, a Washingtonian who carried himself like a senator and
became a lifelong friend; by the high-strutting Frank Smith, much older
and madly popular with the
coeds.[[15]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-15){#cha-15} Mulattoes seemed
to be everywhere, walking indictments of the concupiscence, hypocrisy,
and paradox at the core of all master-slave societies: ""Lots and lots of
mulattoes of that sort, some of whom were financed by their fathers, and
some of them were financed by the fact that as mulattoes they got the
better jobs."" One of them, lanky Henry Hugh Proctor from Tennessee,
future pastor of Atlanta's select First Congregational Church,
remembered Willie and the rainbow student population in the
autobiography he chose to call, significantly, [Between White and
Black.]{.epub-i} But whether racially mixed or, like ""big, black,
earnest"" C. O. Hunter and others, more African in appearance, Willie
admired all of them. ""Such airs, and colored men at that,"" he pinched
himself.[[16]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-16){#cha-16}

""Who Are We?"" the Fisk [Herald]{.epub-i} would ask the year following Du
Bois's editorship of the college's literary magazine. ""We are not the
Negro from whom the chains of slavery fell a quarter of a century ago,
assuredly not."" Rather, they now comprised an elite, confident,
leadership class. ""It can be truly said that we who have learned what
the privileges and responsibilities of citizenship are, have no desire
to see the South ruled simply by majorities. At the same time,"" the
editorial challenged, ""it need not be expected that we will contend for
anything less than our actual deserts in the function of government.""
The South's white supremacy had not yet made a complete mockery of such
sentiments in the mid-1880s. An occasional African-American still went
to the House of Representatives from Alabama, North Carolina, and
Virginia. Notwithstanding poll taxes, multiple ballot boxes, literacy
tests, arcane regulations, and blatant intimidation, 130,344
African-American men were still registered voters in Louisiana, as were
tens of thousands in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia. The southern
white assault on voting rights claimed to be color blind, supposedly
designed to trim from the voting rolls only those who by education and
citizenship were deemed incompetent to participate in democracy.
Approximately one third of Georgia's white voters and one fourth of
Virginia's were expunged from the rolls in the
mid-1880s.[[17]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-17){#cha-17} Many more
black people would of course be eliminated in this scheme in which
voting was a class privilege rather than a civil right. Yet the young
men who matriculated at Fisk and Atlanta and Howard tended to delude
themselves that a franchise supposedly based on education and property
would remain open to them and their class. Two decades later, Fisk man
Du Bois would build a movement on the betrayal of the civil rights of
the African-American elite.

The southerners were just as curious about this rare northerner among
them, so uncommonly smart that he was admitted to the sophomore class.
""Coming out of New England there was something about him no other seemed
to possess,"" Henry Proctor thought. He was at least a year younger than
most of the college-course freshmen, and several years junior to the
normal-school and theology-department students, which made him appear
tender in the extreme. Willie's Yankee upbringing had lumped the gift of
gab, a distinguishing trait of southerners black and white, with such
follies as idleness and gambling. In another year, he would palaver with
the best, but in the fall of 1885 he was far from being the ""lively,
jovial chap, a speaker of great magnetism,"" that Proctor said he became.
Between the lines of the memoirs, we can detect just a trace of social
awkwardness and sexual intimidation. Unable to dissemble, to shoot the
bull, he suffered the terrible dormitory ridicule of the teenager who
fails to hide the fact that he is still a virgin. Livingstone Hall
jeered in disbelief when he had to confess his ignorance of ""the
physical difference between men and
women.""[[18]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-18){#cha-18} Then his
dormitory mates took pity, and would have helped correct the deficiency
speedily if Willie had been willing.

Meantime, he gazed longingly at those female classmates he had met
during his first evening in the Jubilee Hall refectory. G. M. McClellan,
another sophomore, had led him to the dining hall. Thirty years later,
McClellan recalled being surprised by Willie's reaction to the
food---""the comment was unusual. You praised the
food.""[[19]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-19){#cha-19} But more than
food impressed Willie. His memory of that evening's supper he carried to
his grave, retrieving this ""never-to-be-forgotten marvel"" of the moment
when he sat ""opposite two of the most beautiful beings God ever revealed
to the eyes of seventeen."" One of them, Lena Calhoun, was the great-aunt
of Lena Home, who would enchant a middle-aged Du Bois almost as much as
her comely forebear. ""The Calhoun family was a family of mulattoes with
money,"" Willie would animatedly tell the Columbia Oral History Project
interviewer at ninety-two, ""and she was beautifully dressed---oh, a
perfectly lovely girl.""[[20]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-20){#cha-20}
He learned quickly that debonair Frank Smith had already staked his
claim there. But there was no shortage of marvels at Jubilee Hall.

Fisk swarmed with intelligent, attractive women (then and much later),
with Sissie Dorsey (a ""golden fairy""), Mattie Nichol (""dark cream""),
Alice Vassar of the beautiful voice, and stately, competitive Margaret
Murray, Booker T. Washington's future third wife, who would annoy Willie
when he forgot his lines in rhetoric class. For the first time in his
life, he was thrown together with women from ""good"" social
backgrounds---women of color with delicate manners and fine minds. He
must have wondered if Mary Silvina could have been like them had she
been less deprived as a girl and more fortunate as a wife. Several years
stood between the Great Barrington innocent and the man who would
acquire the confident ease with women that made him an impressive
suitor. For the present, Fisk coeds merely smiled, bantered, and told
him how smart he seemed. But if they preferred the company of a Frank
Smith, it was a wonderful comfort to Willie to know that it was not
because of race. No Fisk woman would ever refuse his card because he was
black. His profound relief and delight at having finally reached at Fisk
a safe harbor of feelings could still burst out long afterward, as in
this cathartic passage from [Darkwater:]{.epub-i}

Consider, for a moment, how miraculous it all was to a boy of seventeen,
just escaped from a narrow valley: I willed and lo! my people came
dancing about me,---riotous in color, gay in laughter, full of sympathy,
need, and pleading; darkly delicious girls---'colored' girls---sat
beside me and actually talked to me while I gazed in tongue-tied silence
or babbled in boastful dreams. Boys with my own experiences and out of
my own world, who knew and understood, wrought out with me great
remedies.[[21]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-21){#cha-21}

Yet even in this ideal environment, he would never be able to make
friends easily, especially with men. Younger and less schooled by life
than his dorm mates, it was a question not so much of shyness, although
he always offered it by way of apology, but of insecurity masquerading
as arrogance. Willie had reached full height more than two inches below
the five-feet-eight average for men of his day. It was a feature almost
no one readily noticed about him in later years, offset as it was by
imposing personality and carriage (not once in eighty years of ink does
he mention it), yet, whatever its psychological impact, the fact is that
Du Bois usually found himself physically looking up to men whose
intelligence he frequently looked down upon. So, as he sauntered to
class, he cultivated a mordant sense of humor and a conversational
brevity that was decidedly spiky. Sometimes he went a little too far. A
sarcastic remark caused big C. O. Hunter to twist Willie's arm, warning
him, ""Don't you do that again!"" Willie says he
didn't.[[22]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-22){#cha-22}

In the often strange ways of group acceptance, an almost fatal illness
helped Willie's adjustment at Fisk. In October, typhoid fever flattened
him. Perhaps, as he claims, ""the whole school hung on the bulletins,""
but there is no reason to doubt that his recovery brought cheers in the
dining hall and a boost in popularity. His performance a few days later
on the college English examination won more attention, even though
Willie remained permanently nettled that he placed second after Mary
Bennett, daughter of the professor of German---""a girl and a white one
at that,"" he noted
ungenerously.[[23]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-23){#cha-23} Up and
about, he joined the college church, volunteering to teach Sunday
school. Sunday classes with Willie in the little chapel in Livingstone
Hall were likely to have turned more on expository showmanship than on
instructive piety, although his Great Barrington respect for the tenets
of Congregationalism was still solid. There was some annoyance about the
Sunday school involvement, however, that was soon to have profound
consequences for his beliefs. Looming in the background was ""Pops""
Miller, a much older student upon whose ungainly figure and invidious
mind Willie would heap epithets that anticipate by more than three
decades his imprecations on Marcus
Garvey.[[24]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-24){#cha-24} Miller, always
alert to possible impieties, kept his eyes especially peeled for Willie.

The course of events defies clear reconstruction, but when Willie and
several others were overheard planning a dance, ""Pops"" Miller became
convinced that his darkest suspicions of the Devil's work were valid.
Much hubbub ensued, with appeals to the faculty, citation of Pauline
scripture (""I have never had much respect for Paul since""), and huffy
renunciation of Sabbath duties by the recent typhoid victim. In other
accounts, the dancing controversy is upstaged by a more philosophical
turning point in Willie's abandonment of organized religion. In one of
them, he claimed to have been disgusted by charges of heresy lodged
against a New York Episcopal priest whose book on religion and politics
was used at Fisk. In another, the expulsion of a nationally prominent
Presbyterian divine because of heterodoxy was the cause. Then, maybe, it
was the affront to Willie's logic by George Frederick Wright's [The
Logic of Christian Evidences]{.epub-i} (1880), ""a book we were compelled
to read."" He never got the story quite straight, but, in any case, his
disgust with organized religion was such that he ""just stopped and
refused to teach Sunday School any
more.""[[25]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-25){#cha-25} But not before
writing a dutifully pious letter in February to Reverend Scudder and the
Great Barrington congregation, rejoicing in his religious activities,
the prayers that might ""help guide \[him\] in the path of Christian
duty,"" the ""forty conversions"" at revival, and the arrival on campus of
world-famous evangelist Dwight L.
Moody.[[26]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-26){#cha-26}

Thus began an intellectual journey that would end, after a very short
time, in serene agnosticism. No dark night of the soul or Promethean
defiance of Heaven seized Willie, as far as can be ascertained. In what
seems almost an emotional replay of his mother's death, he calmly
adjusted, outwardly at least, to the departure of another central force
in his life. But had God ever been central in the sense of a spiritual
anchor, rather than simply an appropriate feature of his internal
life---familiar architecture like the blue dolomite Congregational
Church on Main Street? He says that, until the Fisk controversy, he had
never questioned his religious convictions. ""Its theory had presented no
particular difficulties: God ruled the world, Christ loved it, and men
did right, or tried to."" For a life whose exceptional course had been
steered by self-control, intelligence, enormous psychic reserves, and
strategic relationships, Willie's need for a personal deity who
intervened and judged was objectively minimal by the time he finished
college. Frank Hosmer and J. Carlisle Dennis had proven rather more
helpful than God. In the future, as in the private reflections of his
early years, later collected as [Prayers for Dark People,]{.epub-i} or
in the magisterial ""Credo,"" Willie would rhetorically invoke the Deity,
just as the witness of the Nazarene frequently served him as a powerful
literary device.[[27]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-27){#cha-27} While
his ethical standards always remained exemplary, he began to think of
God as ceremonial and largely unavailable for duty as a counselor. Total
loss of conventional faith would have to wait for Harvard. Answering the
query of a Cuban priest many years later, Du Bois provided an
unambiguous reply: ""\[If\] you mean by 'God' a vague Force which, in
some uncomprehensible way, dominates all life and change, then I answer,
Yes; I recognize such Force, and if you wish to call it God, I do not
object.""[[28]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-28){#cha-28}

But while his religious faith shriveled in the hot breath of hypocrisy
and intolerance, Willie rapidly acquired a faith in his race that was
quasi-religious. A letter written to Reverend Scudder in February 1886
revealed that he was finding his existential anchor at Fisk, growing in
self-esteem among people who didn't ""despise \[his\]Â ... color,"" and
learning how to be a ""Negro"" in the fullest sense. And there was real
wonderment, as he looked about him in the Fisk chapel, that ""they are
all my people; that this great assembly of youth and intelligence are
the representatives of a race which twenty years ago was in bondage.""
Visions of his classmates forming the vanguard of African-American
progress, with himself in the lead pointing the way, danced in his head.
In [Darkwater,]{.epub-i} the memoir closest in time to the Fisk
experience, as well as in the closing-years [Autobiography,]{.epub-i}
Willie's reanimation of his 1880s' mood borders on the delusional (even
making allowance for epic prose). He is ""captain of \[his\] soul and
master of fate."" He wills ""and lo!"" his people ""came dancing about
\[him\]---riotous in color, gay in laughter, full of sympathy."" He
prophesies for the race an early arrival in the Promised Land: ""Through
the leadership of men like myself and my fellows we were going to have
these enslaved Israelites out of the still enduring bondage in short
order.""[[29]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-29){#cha-29}

The first year at Fisk taught Willie a good deal about bondage. He had
experiences no amount of reading in the North could ever have equaled.
First came the barbaric violence as pandemic to the South as kudzu.
Lynching of African-Americans, soon to reach such volume as to become
one of the region's pastimes, was beginning its steady, ghoulish rise.
He saw the buckshot tracings by which a leading white Nashville editor
had been fatally splattered for some crusading offense. Many fellow
students went about armed when they left campus to go into the city. The
most cautious public interracial contacts could detonate in a second,
while casual interaction involved risks only the most instructed and
dexterous were advised to undertake. Accidentally brushing a white woman
in town, Willie had instinctively doffed his hat in apology, only to
have her explode in red-faced expletives. ""From that day to this,""
[Darkwater]{.epub-i} insists, he ""never knowingly raised \[his\] hat to
a Southern white woman."" The South was still unready to strip his people
completely of the rights 180,000 of them had served in the Civil War to
win and that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were supposed to
guarantee perpetually. But it was plain to see that that elimination was
almost as certain as the sharecroppers' deepening indebtedness. ""There
is scarcely one public relation in the South,"" wrote the sympathetic
Louisiana novelist George Washington Cable, in 1885, ""where the Negro is
not arbitrarily and unlawfully compelled to hold toward the white man
the attitude of an alien, a menial, and a probable reprobate, by reason
of race and color.""[[30]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-30){#cha-30}

If they were going to be his life's work, Willie needed to spend time
among those African-Americans who were unlikely ever to see the inside
of a Fisk classroom---among real peasants in the rural backcountry.
Instead of returning home at the end of the sophomore year, then, he set
out on a Saturday in late June to walk the Lebanon Pike. It took him
past Andrew Jackson's sprawling estate just outside Nashville, east in
the direction of Knoxville and the Cumberland Mountains, until he came
to Lebanon, seat of Wilson County. After a back-slapping week at the
Lebanon Teachers' Institute (morning classes for white candidates,
afternoon for black), he passed the primitive examination to become an
elementary school teacher. R. C. McMillan, county superintendent, signed
his certificate on June 27, qualifying Willie to teach first grade at a
monthly salary to be negotiated with the local commissioner of schools.
Then, in the rough and tumble of negotiating, Willie forfeited the
small-town post he wanted to an older candidate by dawdling
self-satisfied over dinner. Horseplay and shared watermelon were no
passkey to the job network his Lebanon colleagues were plugged into, he
discovered. ""The county teachers looked at me askance and knew of no
vacant schools in their
vicinity.""[[31]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-31){#cha-31}

He traveled, all told, no more than fifty miles from Nashville, but
measured by the distance from civilization, Willie found himself
entering a zone where time had stopped the day after the day of
jubilee---he ""touched the very shadow of
slavery.""[[32]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-32){#cha-32} Wilson
County, Tennessee, would remain in his memory bank for a lifetime,
influencing a prose to which he was beginning to give a mythic spin, his
conception of what he would later call the black proletariat, and, most
profoundly, his gestating, romantic ideas about African-American ""racial
traits."" Some of the keenest writing would come out of this summer
experience, authentic and graphic---emotional in a personal, as opposed
to its usual heroic, sense. The freshest examples of it are ""The Hills
of Tennessee"" and ""How I Taught School"" in the October and December
issues, respectively, of the [Herald,]{.epub-i} the student magazine.
Although Willie never allows his emotions to be caught off guard if he
can help it, and despite the striving for narrative embellishment, these
pieces come as close as any to revealing an unbuttoned eighteen-year-old
Du Bois. We see him eight miles south of Lebanon on a horse ""with a gait
like a churn handle,"" birds dancing jigs on the treetops; eventually
taking the train to Silver Springs, then sauntering along ""slowly eating
the ripened plums by the wayside,"" unsuccessful but unruffled as he
finds the one-room school-houses along the road already supplied with
teachers.

Suddenly, a mile or so on the approach to Watertown, then a Cumberland
Plateau hamlet of seven homes, Wilson L. Waters's feed store, and a
brand new railroad depot, Josie sprang into the road with a sunlit smile
and a barrage of questions. Josie (her family name was Dowell) was wiry,
dark-skinned, about twenty years old, and physically plain, but every
inch alive. She and he had never seen the likes of each other before. As
they strolled down the road together in mutual fascination, she told him
of the school-house over the hill just beyond Alexandria, a ""land of
'varmints' and rattlesnakes"" to Willie then, but today a sleepy,
attractive town where visitors are still not much more common than a
century ago.[[33]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-33){#cha-33} Presenting
himself to the local school commissioner, a pleasant, white college
fellow who readily appointed him at twenty-eight dollars a month, Willie
could still be surprised in [The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i} that his
acceptance of a dinner invitation meant eating alone after the
commissioner and his family---""even then fell the awful shadow of the
Veil."" Josie's four-room place in a scraggly clearing deep in the woods
became home for the summer, with its illiterate, indolent but solid,
kindly father, its brood of children, and Mrs. Dowell, depicted by
Willie as ""strong, bustling, and energetic, with a quick, restless
tongue, and an ambition to live like
folks.'""[[34]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-34){#cha-34}

Old Colonel Wheeler's log storage barn served as the windowless
schoolhouse for a wriggling mass of fifteen Dowells, Burkes, Lawrences,
Neills, and Hickmans, ranging from age six to twenty-year-old Josie and
""Fat"" Reuben, most of whom made up in earnestness what they lacked in
the rudiments of learning. [The Souls of Black Folk]{.epub-i} and the
[Autobiography]{.epub-i} describe a progressive-education idyll that
summer---the ""fine faith"" his charges reposed in him, their spelling
together, singing, picking flowers, and ""listening to stories of the
world beyond the hill."" But the [Herald]{.epub-i}'s earlier ""How I
Taught School"" is less idyllic, more reminiscent of prim, lovely
Charlotte Forten's Civil War [Diary,]{.epub-i} a hand-wringing classic
by another African-American northerner on a mission of educational
uplift in the backward South. The first ""colored teacher who has dropped
in among these hills,"" Willie knew the local white people had him under
a magnifying glass, on the alert for they knew not exactly what alien
mischief; so he did his jaunty best to please, and pretty well
succeeded, although Fiskites read that he had ""to swallow some large
lumps of 'sassiness,' and even now some of the old farmers say they'll
be 'de-dad-jimmed ef they like sich a biggety
nigger.'""[[35]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-35){#cha-35} An elderly,
respected abecedarian named Uncle Mose swore by the 1857 Webster
speller, making his unhappiness with the newfangled revised edition
loudly manifest in the classroom. Threading his way between purist Uncle
Mose and dad-jimming farmers, by summer's end Willie caught ""faint and
transient glimpses of the dawn in the struggling minds of my pupils.""
Josie, nervous, always in motion, led the class. The [Herald]{.epub-i}
piece closed with Willie vowing he ""wouldn't take \$200 for \[his\]
summer's experience, and \[he\] wouldn't experience it again for
\$2000.""[[36]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-36){#cha-36}

But he did. He was back in Alexandria the following summer at thirty
dollars a month, back in this hardscrabble Eden of postbellum innocence,
as a lodger again with Josie's people. The experience builds in lyricism
now. Josie and her family and the Burkes and the Neills and Fat Reuben
and the others are made symbolic: of agricultural toil sliding into
peonage; of white farmers and black laborers in a symbiosis of fatal
inefficiency; of transforming urban energies doused and drowned by
one-crop economies. There is wasted learning and wasted love,
self-hatred, lethargy, decay, and miscegenated rape. The struggles of
the little people of the South were to be captured in all their fabulous
afflictions, as in this sample threnody from [The Souls of Black
Folk:]{.epub-i}

I would visit Mun Eddings, who lived in two very dirty rooms, and ask
why little Lugene, whose flaming face seemed ever ablaze with the
dark-red hair uncombed, was absent all last week, or why I missed so
often the inimitable rags of Mack and Ed. Then the father, who worked
Colonel Wheeler's farm on shares, would tell me how the crops needed the
boys; and the thin, slovenly mother, whose face was pretty when washed,
assured me that Lugene must mind the baby. 'But we'll start them again
next week.' When the Lawrences stopped, I knew that the doubts of the
old folks about book-learning had conquered again, and so, toiling up
the hillÂ ...[[37]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-37){#cha-37}

The heroic futility of the two summers weighed upon him. He saw written
across the faces deep in Wilson County the rebuked destinies of the
black people who came singing, praying, and aspiring out of slavery, and
who were sinking into ""listless indifference, or shiftlessness, or
reckless bravado."" But if the aspirations sputtered, the praying
continued in jerry-built tabernacles with a ""pythian madness"" Willie
describes wonderfully. And what was sung were the ""sorrow songs"" in
their unmannered, slurred-diction purity which no Jubilee Singers
concert ever truly
captured.[[38]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-38){#cha-38} There is no
question but that he grew fond of the people in Wilson County, that they
came to have meaning for him, transcending symbolism and sociology. The
intensity of his prose when he describes these two summers attests to
the personal impact of the Alexandria sojourns.

Ten years passed before Du Bois saw Alexandria again. When he did, he
remembered that nobody had believed then in ""Doc"" Burke's heroic efforts
to buy the seventy-five acres he worked like a robot. ""'White folks
would get it all,'"" people said. He remembered, too, rocking on Josie's
porch, helping himself to a basket of peaches while her mother boasted
of Josie's savings for college, her sewing machine, and her wages from
the ""big house."" But ten years later, Josie was dead (""'We've had a heap
of trouble since you've been away,'"" her mother said), and the
seventy-five acres Doc Burke had finally bought left him deeper in debt.
That trade-off of material progress for loss of innocence that humanists
are wont to underscore, Willie saw everywhere, in the flight to
Nashville and Knoxville of the young men, in the six-room house the
Burkes were building, the store-bought shoes worn by the wives, the new
Wheeler schoolhouse with large blackboard and windows. ""Death and
marriage had stolen youth and left age and childhood there,"" he
reflected. He departed after this third visit wondering how to ""measure
progress there where the dark face of Josie
lies?""[[39]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-39){#cha-39} Willie might
have been somewhat encouraged could he have known that his teaching
would be remembered a century later in Watertown and Alexandria among
African-American families, and that some of them---the Dowells and
Burkes in particular---would prosper in real estate and
undertaking.[[40]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-40){#cha-40}

He probably never returned again to Alexandria, but in ""My Character,""
an astonishingly confessional chapter in the [Autobiography,]{.epub-i}
Willie in his mid-eighties disclosed for the first time a sexual
watershed in his life. He slept with Josie's mother. Although we can
decode her identity from a cryptic paragraph, it is impossible to know
which summer it happened. But his senior year, if not the year before,
there was no more ribbing about virginity in Livingstone Hall. Finally,
something had happened that enabled him to overcome his mentally
incestuous bonding with Mary Silvina. Great Barrington's taboo on
interracial romance had retarded Willie's sexual maturity, certainly;
and the perceived social deficiencies of the women of his own race in
the town greatly compounded the problem. But there was surely another,
deeper factor at play. If there was at least one young woman of suitable
credentials anywhere in the area---in nearby Lee or Pittsfield or,
somewhat farther, in Springfield---whom a high school graduate and news
reporter could have courted, Willie seems never to have dated her. Mary
Silvina was the woman in his life until the fateful summer in the
Tennessee backcountry. Until then, Willie saw in women of his own kind
and milieu---nice ones---too much of his ambiguously cherished mother.

The world was full of women who could have instructed him in the
pleasures of the flesh, yet there are indications that he found himself
in a double bind. Psychologists would be alert to the subconscious
castration complex that afflicts males who figuratively violate the
paternal taboo against possession of the mother. In Willie's exact,
startling words in the [Autobiography,]{.epub-i} as he ""tried to solve
the contradiction of virginity and motherhood,"" he found himself faced
with the ""other contradiction of prostitution and adultery."" Josie's
mother solved a dilemma that was social as well as sexual. Sex with a
woman who was totally opposite to the imperative, venerated image of the
mother---with a whore---although wrong in the eyes of society and
religion, offered escape from impotence. That the old man would recall
the young man's loss of virginity as a violent encounter in which he was
exploited by an experienced peasant woman (""literally raped"") suggests a
tangle of Freudian pathologies. ""Then, as a teacher in the rural
districts of East Tennessee, I was literally raped by the unhappy wife
who was my landlady.""[[41]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-41){#cha-41}
In Willie's mind, then, the violence of a ""rape"" was the necessary act
of his liberation. Innocent victim, henceforth he would go roaring into
sexual conquests convinced that he was never the initiator because he
always saw himself on his back in a dark bedroom, his ""unhappy landlady""
flexing and groaning on top of him. Henceforth, sex was something the
Devil in others made him do.

It always annoyed Rayford Whittingham Logan, one of his closest future
collaborators, whenever Du Bois insisted (as he often did) that he had
embraced his racial identity only at Fisk. ""Henceforward I was a Negro,""
Du Bois would proclaim, and then soar into a grand vision of his place
in the race, knowing full well that Anglo-Saxon America was objectively
blind by custom and law to intermediate racial categories. Logan always
said that Du Bois's claim of belated racial self-discovery was a
polemical contrivance to give greater punch to his writings about race
relations. To claim that his identity as a Negro was in some sense the
exercise of an option, an existential commitment, was to define Willie's
celebration of and struggle for his people as an act of the greatest
nobility and philanthropy. He was a Negro not because he had to be---was
born immutably among them---but because he had embraced the qualities of
that splendid race and the moral superiority of its cause. With the
country beginning to fill up with Slavic and southern European
immigrants for whom, like the earlier Irish, the surest touchstone of
citizenship was distance between themselves and Americans of African
ancestry, pretending to be racially indeterminate was an invitation to
physical battery or even institutional commitment. You were either white
or black; there was no Creole or mestizo (with the problematic exception
of Louisiana), and mulatto was largely a census term that was shortly to
be abandoned.[[42]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-42){#cha-42}

Willie acknowledged this fact, and yet he knew better than to believe it
completely because, although only white and black Americans formally
existed (Native Americans were invisible and Asians excluded), the veil
of color had always been porous. The subtle and not-so-subtle advantages
of light skin were a social reality, however varied and complex the
manifestations, South and
North.[[43]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-43){#cha-43} What is of more
delicate and indubitable importance is that Willie's feelings about race
in these early years were more labile or tangled, not to say
conflictive, than his public professions revealed. Grandfather
Alexander's death in his junior year not only brought a small legacy of
four hundred dollars, it brought him those diary entries flashing over
Franco-Caribbean roots like far-off lightning, enhancing a lordly sense
of self. Willie's racial shape in his last year at Fisk was still
congealing, and it would always be an alloy, never entirely pure.
Rayford Logan was right about the debater's point, but he elected to
pass over the deeper significance of the racial-identity claim that
sociologist E. Franklin Frazier, another protÃ©gÃ© of the mature Du Bois,
grasped: that Willie's ambivalence endowed him with a resilient
superiority complex, and that that complex convinced Willie himself, as
well as many others, that his lifelong espousal of the ""Darker World""
was an optional commitment based above all upon principles and reason,
rather than a dazzling advocacy he was born into. In an interview
recorded for Folkways Records shortly before leaving for Ghana, Du Bois
would speak precisely and revealingly about racial belonging, telling
his interlocutor that it had been during the Fisk period that he had
become ""quite willing to be a Negro and to work with the Negro
group.""[[44]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-44){#cha-44}

This developing sense of mission was fully evident in his senior year.
Fisk was basic training for combat, and Fiskites were to provide the
officer corps. If he had not yet coined his most famous term, the
concept of the ""talented tenth"" must already have been gestating in ""The
New Negro,"" a lost essay submitted to [Century Magazine,]{.epub-i}
probably in his senior
year.[[45]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-45){#cha-45} ""An Open Letter
to the Southern People,"" another 1887 unpublished offering, would have
pleased Mary Silvina. It championed the prohibition of liquor while
explaining that African-Americans throughout the South voted with the
wets in recent state referenda because of ignorance and their suspicions
about the better classes of white people---themselves to blame through
direct neglect of public education and indirect encouragement of mob
rule. His open letter would also have enormously pleased the principal
of the new industrial school at Tuskegee, Alabama, Booker T. Washington,
in its plea for humane southern solutions to southern problems: ""Let us
then, recognizing our common interests (for it is unnecessary to speak
of our dependence upon you), work for each other's interest, casting
behind us unreasonable demands on the one hand, and unreasonable
prejudice on the other."" But it was Willie's nature always to couple
conciliation with admonition, which this piece did with supreme
clairvoyance. ""The South will not always be solid,"" he wrote, ""and in
every division the Negro will hold the balance of
power.""[[46]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-46){#cha-46}

He had got himself on the [Herald]{.epub-i} as editor in charge of
student publications exchanges his first year, barely a month after
recovery from the typhoid attack. A typical exchanges-editor comment
(this one about Lincoln University's [Register]{.epub-i}) archly noted
that ""good advice is acceptable even if it comes from sophomoric
effusions."" Which could not be said for Nashville's Roger Williams
University [Record]{.epub-i} because, ""from its tone,"" Willie judged it
to be published ""by the faculty and not the
students.""[[47]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-47){#cha-47} Entirely to
his liking, on the other hand, was the Greensboro College
[Message]{.epub-i} containing a ""first rate woman's rights argument."" By
December 1886, Willie was [Herald]{.epub-i} literary editor and in
November 1887 editor-in-chief, with Tom Calloway as business manager,
the first of many years ahead in which ""T. J."" Calloway would serve
Willie in this role. Along with running the college magazine, he devoted
himself to public speaking, writing a philosophical essay on forensics,
and becoming, according to his own estimate, ""an impassioned orator,""
although reason rather than passion was what most audiences would
remember him for.[[48]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-48){#cha-48} He
was an enraptured member of little Dean Spence's Mozart Society, never
missing rehearsals for the religious oratorios, marveling at Ed Bailey's
tenor, and amused as the frock-coated dean waved his hands in the air.
""Our race, but a quarter of a century removed from slavery, can master
the greatest musical compositions,"" Willie clucked
editorially.[[49]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-49){#cha-49}

The [Herald]{.epub-i} was where he made his mark, though. Turning its
brittle pages to Willie's ""Editorial"" and ""Editorial Toothpick"" columns
reveals a mind constantly running ahead, sometimes too rapidly for the
information it contained. Ebullitions in the Balkans are commented upon
as well as, closer to home, the duty of the nation to protect the rights
of patriotic Fisk students. He plows through the new one-volume edition
of George Washington Williams's [History of the Negro Race in America
from 1619 to 1880,]{.epub-i} rejoicing that ""at last we have a
historian,"" and an African-American historian at that. He bids a highly
complimentary farewell to T. Thomas Fortune, retiring editor of the New
York [Freeman]{.epub-i} (the old [Globe]{.epub-i}), the man who had
started Willie on his amateur journalism
career.[[50]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-50){#cha-50} His
enthusiastic feminism (striking in a young Negro male of his Victorian
cast) is reiterated in an editorial on the Women's Christian Temperance
Union meeting in Nashville---""the Age of Women is surely dawning."" In
that same vein, the issues for December 1887 through January and March
1888 carried ""Tom Brown at Fisk,"" the editors first extended sortie into
fiction. The three-chapter short story's protagonist is a woman, a Fisk
student teacher named Ella Boyd, marking the appearance of the female
protagonist as an autobiographical device Willie would employ in the
ambitious novels [The Quest of the Silver Fleece]{.epub-i} and [Dark
Princess.]{.epub-i} As in the novels, Tom, the male figure in the
[Herald]{.epub-i} story, is something of a lovable, morally innocent
stumblebum decisively aided by quick-witted, complex women as he copes
with life's realities.[[51]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-51){#cha-51}
For reasons better left to later exploration, he preferred the company
of intelligent women in fiction as in real life.

Like Great Barrington African-Americans, Fisk students receive their due
of lecturing and admonishment. The ""Editorial Toothpick"" for March 1888
informs readers that Thomas Carlyle, the fulminating Scots historian and
essayist (Willie spelled the name Carlisle), having once reproved a
student who ""had no plans laid for his future life,"" would find at Fisk
""several weeks of profitable employment at the same business."" What was
wrong with them? Why wasn't there a Fisk student ""at Leipsic \[sic\], or
a Fisk metaphysician at Berlin? Aren't we smart enough?"" Willie
certainly thought he was. His discovery of Carlyle had an influence on
his prose more enduring than Macaulay's. Macaulay's smug, practical Whig
temperament was a pale inspiration next to the High Tory prejudices
Carlyle expressed through effulgent adjectives and magnificent
invective. The [Herald']{.epub-i}s editor was undoubtedly ignorant of
Carlyle's infamous fulminations against blacks in ""The Nigger Question""
as incapable of surviving outside slavery. Immersion in the Scotsman's
works---[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History]{.epub-i}
and the slashing, egocentric [Sartor Resartus]{.epub-i}---would come in
the Harvard years, but he was already wading in the waters of
authoritarian
romanticism.[[52]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-52){#cha-52} Fan mail
from one [Herald]{.epub-i} reader brought portentous thanks for ""words
of encouragementÂ ... toward a life that shall be an honor to the Race.""
Yet Willie was also capable of lighter, more common concerns. He once
even made fun of his own editorial pretensions, confessing that his
""demeanor even surpasses in superciliousness the far-famed senior
prep.""[[53]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-53){#cha-53}

For all his usual twenty-year-old gravitas, Willie Du Bois may actually
have become fairly popular by the end of his Fisk education. He was a
new man in his confident, verbally magnetic dealings with female
classmates. Pert Maria Benson from Nashville, who went on to teach at
Tuskegee, admired him. His regular date was an attractive coed whom he
never identified other than as Nellie. As she was Willie's first
sweetheart, she may have been the recipient of a fair amount of bravado
and lack of consideration. They corresponded once or twice after leaving
Fisk, and, in a rare mention of her soon thereafter, Willie says that
they have broken up ""from no fault"" of his, although, in the same
remarkable circular letter, he alludes to his ""[penchant]{.epub-i} for
hurting other peoples'
feelings.""[[54]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-54){#cha-54} Henry
Proctor and Willie were the same age and amiable rivals in debating, but
Proctor was to spend six years getting his bachelor's degree due to the
miserable schooling of his Fayetteville, Tennessee, youth. By the time
they met again in Atlanta at the turn of the century, Yale Divinity
graduate Proctor was one of the African-American lights of
Congregationalism, a powerful speaker, opinion maker, and staunch
Republican with a girth matching that of William Howard Taft, his
favorite president.[[55]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-55){#cha-55} As
for others in the class of '88, Willie's relationship with them seems to
have been more collegial than intimate. He felt that they ""little
understood each other,"" but they did share a bond of common experience
strong enough to keep a senior year vow to write. Two years after
graduating from Fisk, one of his self-absorbed circular letters to his
classmates alluded to a ""light-heartedness of other days,"" but all
indications are that, while nineteen-year-old Willie was by turns
congenial and sarcastic, he was decidedly too earnest to be thought of
as lighthearted.[[56]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-56){#cha-56}

Surviving school records for these years are sparse in detail. Dean
Spence, Fisk's gatekeeper in Greek and French, in fact kept only
impressionistic comments about students, in Willie's case the notation
forwarded to Harvard that he was ""one of my best."" Math professor
Herbert Wright judged his work to be ""of a very high order."" Grave
President Cravath concurred. ""An unusually quick, active mind,"" he
advised the Harvard admissions committee. Professor Helen Morgan's
description of Willie's work in Latin was as detailed as it was
enthusiastic, speaking of Willie's ""manliness, faithfulness to duty and
earnestness in study."" Morgan's careful comments track her student
through the twenty-first book of Livy, ""5/5ths of the Odes of Horace, 3
satires, 3 of the shorter Epistles, and the entire Ars Poetica, and the
Agricola of Tacitus."" That Morgan, the favorite of most Fisk students,
thought highly of Du Bois the man as well as the scholar serves as
something of an indication of a personality more serious than arrogant.
This was the point science professor Chase wanted to make in his Harvard
reference letter, warning the committee, ""If his application should be
accepted I should fear that he might give you the impression of being
somewhat conceited.""[[57]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-57){#cha-57}

In June 1888, five graduating seniors posed for their class photograph;
a sixth, the aristocratic Ransom Edmondson, was absent, but his diploma
was subsequently granted. The three women, Leonora Bowers of Galveston,
Texas, Maria Benson of Nashville, and Mary Stewart of Oswego, New York,
stand corsetted and coiffed, looking with unsmiling directness into the
tripod camera. L. A. Tindall of Aberdeen, Mississippi, sits in Prince
Albert coat and polished boots looking slightly away with a hint of
preoccupation on his handsome face. Willie also sits. He and the camera
meet eye to eye in a pleasantness that seems out of character. Out of
range, someone who may have hoped they were going to have a future
together---the ""Nellie"" or ""Nell"" of his twenty-fifth birthday
reminiscences---waited, proudly holding Willie's diploma. A short time
earlier, each had stepped before the interested and proud commencement
audience of faculty, students, and local citizens, a sprinkling of white
people included, to say something in a manner befitting the world
awareness and polish of Fisk University's thirteenth college graduation
class. Willie chose ""BismarckÂ ... my hero,"" and, incidentally, also one
of Carlyle's.

Bismarck had made a nation ""out of bickering peoples."" The Second Reich
should be a model for African-Americans ""marching forth with strength
and determination under trained leadership."" Willie fully shared the
German statesman's impatience with outmoded tradition and cumbersome
institutions. African-Americans had achieved much in the quarter-century
since the end of slavery, but if they were to become a cohesive, modern
people then they must submit to strenuous discipline and scientific
culture. ""The life of this powerful Chancellor illustrates the power and
purpose, the force of an idea,"" Willie told his audience. ""It shows what
a man can do if he will."" Here, the young orator introduced a sage
caveat about expediency and power, for his admiration of his subject was
not entirely slavish. Bismarck's success carried with it ""a warning lest
we sacrifice a lasting good to temporary advantage; lest we raise a
nation and forget the people, become a Bismarck and not a Moses. To one
object of his life Bismarck sacrificed even truth and liberty. No lie
ever stood between him and success; no popular right ever hindered that
ruthless hand of iron.""[[58]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-58){#cha-58}

In later years, Willie felt compelled to explain his choice of
commencement theme. Not only was Bismarck the architect of an empire
banged together on battlefields, held together by Junkers and industrial
magnates and aggrandized through diplomatic chicanery, he was convener,
moreover, of the European banquet at which whole sides of Africa were
served up. Fisk was a ""good college,"" with its curriculum proudly
conventional in the best traditions of the New England faculty. Willie's
textbooks in ethics and logic propagated philosophical idealism as the
only true doctrine worthy of an educated Christian. John Stuart Mill,
Auguste Comte, and Herbert Spencer were profaners---""infected
throughout"" by heresies in Immanuel Kant's [Critique of Pure
Reason]{.epub-i}---wrote the Scots divine and Princeton president James
McCosh in his authoritative [Laws of Discursive Thought]{.epub-i}
(1870). Nor did the supposedly modern [The Science of Mind]{.epub-i}
(1881) by John Bascom advance beyond putting a gloss upon the cumulative
materialist evidences disclosed by the physical sciences. The new
heterodoxies of political and economic thought were not so much opposed
as unknown. Certainly, it never occurred to Dean Spence to add the
just-translated first volume of [Das Kapital]{.epub-i} to the college's
supplementary reading list. Consequently, Willie's estimable racial
motives hadn't saved him from falling into the abyss between his
""education and the truth in the world,"" as he put it, adding
confessionally (deleted from the Russian edition of the
[Autobiography]{.epub-i}) that he was ""blithely European and imperialist
in outlook, democratic as democracy was conceived in
America.""[[59]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-59){#cha-59}

If the irony of the Iron Chancellor being extolled by the future father
of Pan-Africanism has been severely noted by critics, it is relevant to
mention for historical context that one of Willie's four classmates
spoke to the theme ""Anglo-Saxon Influence."" Fisk students were
emphatically men and women of their Victorian times, and as Willie left
the South proclaiming himself now fully a ""Negro"" and dedicated to the
cause of racial uplift, he carried with this commitment an elitist,
literary conception of what that meant, equally exemplified by the
writings of Thomas Carlyle and their heroic rendering of historic
personalities as by the heavy, deadly plottings of Bismarck the
Junker.[[60]{.epub-sup}](note.html#chapter4-60){#cha-60}
