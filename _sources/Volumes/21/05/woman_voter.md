# The Woman Voter (1921)

The colored women have made a splendid record at their first national election. Applying for registration in large numbers, they endured purposeful delays and deliberate insults. They have shown themselves in states like Georgia and Louisiana to be more modern and sensible than their white sisters; and throughout the country they cast a large and influential vote.

In the encouragement which they have received before and since the election there has been but one false note. James B. Dudley, colored president of a state school in Greensboro, 
N.C., came out in the local paper before election with several columns of advice to colored women not to attempt to vote. The arguments adduced deserve no particular consideration. They were the familiar remarks about "women in the home" and the general unwisdom of Negroes "meddling" in politics. Mr. Dudley received the usual pat on the back from the white editor. The grave and astonishing thing about this is that at this late day a Negro leader, North or South, should dare to advise colored men or women not to vote. This was a general procedure 25 and even 15 years ago, but we have almost forgotten it, and it is to be hoped that James B. Dudley is the last of a pitiable group.
