# How Shall We Vote (1924)

```{margin}
This was DuBois's contribution to a symposium on the 1928 presidential election.
```
I shall vote for La Follette and Wheeler, unusually honest and straight-forward men. I believe in them. I do not believe in Coolidge. I despise Dawes and his ilk and I will trust no Wall Street lawyer nor any relative of southernized Bryan. I believe in the economic foundations of most of our present social problems and while I wish that the anti-Negro Railway Brotherhood who are supporting La Follette would let him say a plainer, cleaner word on the Negro, I remember that he has said as much as-Coolidge and could scarcely do less if elected president. Especially am I pleased at his clear-cut condemnation of the Klan and his promise to free Haiti.
