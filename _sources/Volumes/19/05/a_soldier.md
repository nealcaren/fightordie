This is the picture of Edgar Caldwell, who is under sentence of death, for defending himself against the crew of a street car in Anniston, Ala., and killing one of them.

His case will be argued before the Supreme Court of the United States, about March 1.

We want 500 Negroes who believe in Negro manhood, to send immediately one dollar each to J. E. Spingarn, Treasurer of the N.A.A.C.P., 70 Fifth Avenue, New York City, for Caldwell's defense.
