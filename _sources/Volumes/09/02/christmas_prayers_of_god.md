# The Christmas Prayers of God (1914)

<div class="poem">
Name of God's Name!  
Red murder reigns;  
All Hell is loose;  
On gold autumnal air  
*Walk grinning devils barbed and hoofed,*  
While high on hills of hate,  
Black-blossomed, crimson sky'd,  
Thou sittest, dumb.
</div>

<div class="poem">
Father Almighty!  
This earth is mad!  
Palsied, our cunning hands;  
Rotten, our gold;  
Our argosies reel and stagger  
Over empty seas;  
All the long aisles  
Of Thy great temples, God,  
Stink with the entrails  
Of our souls.  
And Thou art dumb.
</div>

<div class="poem">
Above the thunder of Thy thunders, Lord,  
Lightening Thy lightnings,  
Rings and roars  
The dark damnation  
Of this Hell of war.  
Red piles the pulp of hearts and heads,  
And little children's hands.
</div>

<div class="poem">
Allah!  
Elohim!  
Death is here!  
Dead are the living, deep dead the dead.  
Dying are earth's unborn---
</div>

<div class="poem">
The babes' wide eyes of genius and of joy;  
Poems and prayers, sun-glows and earth-songs;  
Great pictured dreams,  
En-marbled phantasies,  
Hymns of high Heaven,  
All fade, in this dread night,  
This long ghost night—  
While Thou art dumb.
</div>

<div class="poem">
Have Mercy!  
Have mercy upon us, miserable sinners!  
Stand forth, unveil Thy face,  
Pour down the light  
That seethes above Thy throne,  
And blaze this devil's dance to darkness!  
Hear!  
Speak!  
In Christ's great name—
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="poem">
I hear.  
Forgive me, God.  
Above the thunder I hearkened;  
Beneath the silence, now,  
I hear.
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="poem">

(Wait, God, a little space.  
It is so strange to talk with Thee---
Alone!)
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="poem">
This gold?  
I took it.  
Is it Thine?  
Forgive; I did not know.
</div>

<div class="poem">
Blood? Is it wet with blood?  
'Tis from my brother's hands.  
(I know; his hands are mine.)  
It flowed for Thee, O Lord.
</div>

<div class="poem">
War? Not so, not war:  
Dominion, Lord, and over black, not white.  
Black, brown and fawn,  
And not Thy chosen brood, O God,  
We murdered.
</div>

<div class="poem">
To build Thy kingdom,  
To drape our wives and little ones,  
And set their souls a'glitter—  
For this we killed these lesser breeds  
And civilized their dead,  
Raping red rubber, diamonds, cocoa, gold.
</div>

<div class="poem">
For this, too, once, and in Thy name  
I lynched a Nigger---
</div>

<div class="poem">
(He raved and writhed,  
I heard him cry,  
I felt the life light leap and lie,  
I watched him crackle there, on high,  
I saw him wither!)
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="poem">
Thou?  
Thee?  
I lynched Thee?
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="poem">
Awake me, God, I sleep!  
</div>

<div class="poem">
What was that awful word Thou saidst?  
That black and riven Thing--was. it Thee?
That gasp---was it Thine?  
This pain---is it Thine?  
Are then these bullets piercing Thee?  
Have all the wars of all the world,  
Down all dim time, drawn blood from Thee?
Have all the lies, and thefts, and hates---
Is this Thy crucifixion, God,  
And not that funny little cross,  
With vinegar and thorns?
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="poem">
Help!  
I sense that low and awful cry—  
Who cries?  
Who weeps  
With silent sob that rends and tears—  
Can God sob?
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="poem">
Who prays?  
I hear strong prayers throng by,  
Like mighty winds on dusky moors—  
Can God pray?
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Prayest Thou, Lord, and to me?  
<p class = "verse">*Thou* needest me?  
<p class = "verse">Thou *needest* me?  
<p class = "verse">Thou needest *me*?  
<p class = "verse">Poor wounded Soul!  
<p class = "verse">Of this I never dreamed. I thought---  
<p class = "verse">*Courage, God*,  
<p class = "verse">*I come!*
</div>
