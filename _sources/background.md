> Although in the strictest sense, the Crisis does not qualify as a black periodical because it was controlled by a pre- dominantly white-run organization, no study of the black press during World War I can ignore this highly influential journal. Black news- papers commented on its content frequently, and the government and white Americans viewed it as a faithful representative of black opin- ion. Moreover, its black editor exercised a good deal of independence in determining the Crisis’s content. (Jordan 2001)


> The most interference came from Oswald Garrison Villard, a chair- man of the ’s executive board in the organization’s early years, whom Du Bois accused of acting out of unconscious racial prejudice.66 But even  executive board members Mary White Ovington and Joel E. Spingarn, allies in whom Du Bois saw ‘‘no shadow’’ of racial prej- udice, disagreed pointedly with him over his tone.67 Both Ovington and Spingarn—like Villard—sought to increase the executive board’s control over the Crisis.68 They also used friendly persuasion to in- fluence Du Bois’s writing. In one instance, Spingarn informed his ‘‘friend’’ that the  board had come to see the Crisis editor as a spoiled child who refused to ‘‘play the game’’ and subordinate his own  will for the good of the group. ‘‘Many’’ now believed Du Bois should be ‘‘eliminated’’ from the organization, he said. Spingarn hoped Du Bois would stay, but he suggested the editor become more agreeable.69 Ovington advised Du Bois to stop offending whites in his editorials and reminded him that his job depended on pleasing white readers.

> In spite of white interference, Du Bois spoke out for black equality and against racism in a clear and militant voice. He frequently out- maneuvered  board members to get his way and wrote about taboo subjects like social equality and armed black self-defense.73 Yet his proximity to white people altered the dynamic of his effort. The Crisis was certainly more measured than the Guardian. In accepting the editorship, Du Bois, for example, had agreed not to use the jour- nal to attack Washington and to ‘‘avoid personal rancor of all sorts.’’ 74 Du Bois was surrounded closely by the white audience he hoped to reach, a reality of which his colleagues often reminded him. White individuals, therefore, had a more direct impact on Du Bois than they had on other black editors. At the same time, the  proved to be an important conduit for the black press to reach white America. Du Bois frequently repeated or summarized editorials from the black press in the Crisis, which gained more notice than most black weeklies. In addition, black viewpoints sometimes passed into the mainstream press through Villard, publisher of a major New York daily, the Evening Post, and the influential Nation magazine. (28-29)


 quence of postwar militancy among these more conservative journals when the Post Office Translation Bureau chief, Robert Bowen, held the May issue at the New York Post Office because of an editorial he deemed ‘‘seditious’’ and ‘‘insolently abusive of the country.’’ In ‘‘Re- turning Soldiers,’’ W. E. B. Du Bois seemed to be making up for his ‘‘Close Ranks’’ editorial.  (5)
