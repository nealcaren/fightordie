In 1911, a chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy gave a medal to Colin W. Covington, a University of South Carolina Student, for his essay, "The Freedman's Bureau." Covington plagiarized his submission from a 1901 essay of the same name published by Du Bois in the Atlantic Monthly. Du Bois publishes portions of each side-by-side in the April 1912 issue, concluding that a less modest person would want "that medal clipped from the proud young Southern breast that bears it and pinned on his own."
