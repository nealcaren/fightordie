# A Program for a Sociological Society
<h2>Atlanta University<br>1897</h2>

I desire this afternoon to read to the First Sociological Club a
candid criticism of its' work and a suggestion for its' future activity.
I do this the more boldly because I am a member of the organization and as such must bear my part of the responsibility for its' short­ comings; and at the same time, I speak as an outsider, for in the year that I have had my name on the rolls I have had no opportunity to share in the work of the club. I always hear with a certain foreboding shiver of the formation of a club for any kind of sociological work, for my experience has taught me that the percentage of absolute failure among
such clubs is very large. The trouble is apt to be that the persons forming clubs for social reform have very vague ideas of what the science of sociology really is, and what is the real aim and object of their striving. Consequently it can easily happen that they drift aimlessly on until the members begin to wonder whether it is worthwhile to waste so much time doing nothing. I fancy I have seen in this club something of the same tendency, and it seems to me that the great need of this organization is a clearer conception of its' aims and more practical
and persistent work to accomplish these objects.

I have therefore chosen for my subject <em>A Program for a Sociological Society</em>, and I want to divide what I have to say in six parts. First I want to show what Sociology is. Second--- What the science has accomplished. Third--- By what methods its work has been done. Fourth--- How the material and knowledge thus collected can best be utilized. Fifth--- What the society has already accomplished and why, And finally what this society might and ought to do.

## 1st. What is Sociology

There was a vast revolution which took place in the early part of 
this century that is too often forgotten by educated people. It came after that terrible upheaval of human institutions which we call the French Revolution, after the orgies of Robespierre, Danton, and Marat, and became finally the great instrument that freed Europe from the grasp of the arch-tyrant Napoleon. This revolution was the industrial revolution of the 19th century. It began in the 18th century, when the science of chemistry was first well established, when geology gained a sure foundation when Brinley showed the world how to dig canals uphill, when iron began to be smelted by coal instead of charcoal, and above all when James Watt turned a tea-kettle into a steam engine. Such epoch-making inventions changed the civilization of the world and with the dawn of the 19th century came an industrial revolution --- factories started up, towns grew, commerce expanded, capital increased, the world market widened. If we regard this industrial movement more carefully we shall see that of all departments of human industry the manufacture of cotton made the most gigantic strides in this epoch. The ancient world dressed in wool, the middle age in wood and linen, the modern world dressed largely in cotton. The series of inventions that made cotton manufacture possible are a curious example of coincidence. Between the years 1775 and 1825, Arkwright Hargreaves, Cartwright, and Eli Whitney had changed the spinning wheel into the factory and made the southern United States the cotton field of the world.

This industrial revolution had serious consequences: first it fastened American Slavery in this country and made emancipation more difficult, and the Negro problem more baffling; More that that in all lands it gave rise to and intensified those intricate questions of life and death and civilization which we call social problems: human being were, by the new concentration of industrys, crowded into centers of population and the difficulties, deseases, and maladjustments of human life became intensified and more patent to the eye. Crime, poverty, desease, prostitution, 
ignorance, and death began to assume threatening proportions. Men came to be attracted to these sinister phenomena and to ask what they real­ly meant, how far they were remediable, and how far inevitable.

There was then but one science which undertook the study of the phenomena of human action and th twas the science of political economy. But this science was limited in scope: it began in the 17th nd 18th century when the phenomena of money and international trade first assumed importance and confined itself simply to a study of wealth: it asked how goods were produced, how they were distributed among the producers, and
how their owners exchanged them for other goods. It thus took into account only a feW human activities under stable conditions of society. The industrial revolution, however, had greatly changed conditions, and brought
a distinct demand for wider inquiry into the causes and scope of human action ---  deeper search for the reasons of present conditions and the intelligent application  of such knowledge to methods of social regenerat­ion. This was the beginning of th modern science of Sociology.

Sociology is therefore the name given to that vaat field of inquiry into human action aa manifested in modern organized life. It cannot study all human action under all circumstances, but thay human action
which by its regularity gives evidence of the presence of laws. 
What these laws are we hardly know, and yet we do know that 
there are in life cur­ious and noticeable coincidences --- rythm in life and death, a working out of cause and effect, evidenes of force action and reaction, which cannot be ignored or neglected. Many eminent men still insist that this mass of partially digested facts cannot be called a science --- and indeed if you mean by science, a body knowledge with definitely stated laws, and carefully systematized facts, then Sociology is not yet a science and may never become one. But if you mean by Sociology a vast and fruitful field of inquiry into the mysterious phenomena of human action, which
has yielded evidence of the working of scientific laws to some extent, and
promises much for the future --- if such a work deserves, as many
think, the name of science, then Sociology is one of the greatest of sciences.


But it is impossible to tell what a science is merely by defining it --- the definition is the last thing a science discovers --- indeed it	can truth­fully be said that no science can be fully defined until it is perfect, until its work is done. The best explanation of a science then is a deecription of the sort of work it is doing and what it has already accomplished.
I come therefore to the second point in my talk.


## 2nd. What has Sociology done?

Sociology has studied the proportionate nwnber of the two sexes in the diffPrP,nt countr.ies, the numo"'r of people of different ages, the number of births each year in diff0rent localiti?.s, the number of deaths from various dis as s, the size of families, the av0rage nwnb r of rooms in dwellings,
the extent of illit.,.racy, the n'umber of communicants in the diff9rent church0s the occupations which men pursue, the income from their work, the way that income is expended; the number of thd blind, deaf, dwnb, and insane, the extent and dPgree of poverty, the prevalence of suicide, the extent and
kinds of crime, the characteristics of criminals, the distribution and migration of population, the distribution of property, etc. Moreover it has sought to gen ralize much of this mass of facts and show how all these actions and phenomenas tend to a c rtain rhythm and regularity which we call the social group. In the social group the distribution of the sex and age of the individuals remain continually 1:1.bout the samP. despite birth and dP.ath, and th r te of births and deaths varies so little that it can be predict"Jd within limits.	The incom'?, ocqupation, expenditure, and crime tP.nds in the same way und'!r forms of law. This so-called Social Law seems partly voluntary, partly involuntary, but in all cases its reg­
ularity is much grater than thP cdsual read r dreams. These social groups in turn combine to form that higher gen ralization which we call Society.
Society is simply a general name for the regularities of human action - for the general fact that when 50, 100, Or 1,000,000 live together they do not all act irresponsibly or at random but according to well-known
 

maxima, social forc a and laws.
All this that I have said can b at b, illuatratPd by a few actual examplP.s. In Europe, for inatancP., rep"l.i:ted inv••atigation has proven that for 0v0ry 1,000 males th- re are about 1,024 females. Thia is
00	CharactP.ristic of old countries. In the United StatAs, on the other
fl--.
, hand there are only 952 females for every 1,000 males. In the older,
,  I"
fV)	eastern states, however, we should expect to find conditions approaching
those in Europe - and sure enough there are 1,005 females to every 1,000 males. To show the significence of such facts let us go a step farther: We find in the city of Baltimore 1,310 Negro women to every 1,000 men.
We can immediately say this is surely an abnorman situation and must have something to do with the large number of illegitimate births in that city
Statistics of age show that in normal countries about one third of the population is under 15 years of age, yet the nations vary consider­ ably: for instance take children under 10 y ara of age; in England they form 24% of the population, in France only 18%, among the Negroes of the land 28%. Turning now to the old pP.ople 60 and over and we find that they form 7% of the 9opulation of England; 13% of that of France; and 2% among our race. Such differences simply mean oor family life among our prople.
The statistics of births and deaths are always of great interest and con Pquently lia•le to misuse. We may have two especially marked types: a population with a low birth -rate and low death-rate like France or a population with a high birth r te and high death rate like American Negro. The latter is  a sign of a low standard of culture - early marriage, illegitimacy and nP.glect of the laws of health; the the formP.r is	usually a dign of high civilization - postponement of
marriag until the B'1ppor·::of a family is  assured, and life according
\ -
to thn laws of h,>-gi:me. Son in th same country the character of a
community may easily bP. approxim tely fiXPd by m asuring the number
 
of p ople in evP.ry thousand that die annually. A death rate above 26 is high, while one above 30 points to srave ddngers. The rate ay be as low as 18 as in Norway. The average dea;th rate of Neeroes in cities is	34.
Where sooilolgical inquiry reveals gr t differences in the con­
ditions of diff rent groups of people this is usually evidence of some
i unseen cause which makes the variation. For instance, we can represent
I
the occupations of the people of Philadelphia by th following set of door stP.ps:
--t' ;.t.. - -	Agriculture
-	?rofessions
---------Domestic & Personal service
------Trade and Transportation
·-='------Mfg.  & MachiM Industry
If however we represent th occupations of the Negroes of the city, we find the steps hard for climbing.

What is the meaning of this striking differgnce? It is explained fully by ona comprehensive word SLATIRY. Thus history writes itself in figures and diaaTama.
In the mattPr of crime,sociology has done some of its best work; let us notice only one - the connection of orlme and age. In Germany for instance it has been found that 15% of all 9 rsons bet een 21 and 40 have b0en convictF.1d for crime, 9% of those batween 40 and 60, and 7% of those between 12 nnd 18 years of age. Further analyzing these figures it is found that the most criminal age is between 20 and ZO, and among young unmarried men. Taking for instance the Negro criminal in the EastP.rn section of Pennsylvania; we find the remarkable fact that 67% of them were under 30 y ars of age and 11% uand 20.
Using such minute and detailed statistics sociology has built up the theory of the social group. The country village is a social group.
 
Its population distri.but d in a 1J'!rta.in normal order as to ag and sex and conjugal condition, Ite birth a.nd deatll regulating the increase of population. There is some crime, a school, a church, a village store, The population is iv1ded among different occupations, social classes make a faint appearance and there is a general public opinion which re­ presents of synthesis of lik id'!as.	Such a group may grow to a city or
to a nation, but as it grows we note certain peculiarities: it forms
'I		wi tr,in its0lf oth"r smaller groups for special urposes - clubs for amusement or r ading, church soci ties, associations of capital and
labor call0d shops or compani s or factories and etc. These sub-groups
we might call organs for carrying out the special work of society, just

th0 wholP organism of the body. T:1is we r-"f r to when we speak of so­ ciPty being organized - of course this is but an analogy for the orga­ nization of sbcfoty is far from complete and individual free will must ever hind'!r that conswnmation in this world. Neverthel'!ss advance in civilization is to a c rtain extent advance in the p rfeoting of the organization of soci ty.
0uch is the work that Sociology has accomplished. It .is to be sure only a b"'ginning: our statistics are woefully imperfect. Our methods of obePrvation are crude and th material at hand ie largely an unclassified mass of facts, the value of which is various and uncertain. Neverthe­ less gigantic strides hav been taken in th last 10 years, something has been done, and the outlook for th future is bright. Thie brings me to the fourth point I wish to discuss.
4th.	Use of Sociological Material
The interest in so•cial r<>form and general betterment which animates so many excellent people today must not be mistaken for the science of
u
Sociology. There are many people who have a val1t, disire to right wrongs,
help the needy, and reform the vicious. Unfortunately these people in
 
very many instanses arP.ignorant of the r0aults of scientific r s arch in thP.se lines - thny do not know the value and meaninr of statistics and they often waste money and energy, or do absolute harm, either by anti-
" quated or discredited methods. If anyone should inform an ordinary
-!., oiti7,en that ch mists had discoverad a new element, Argon - he would say very well or bravol and be don, - he would not attempt to <liscuss the matt.r or draw conclusions - he ia no ch9mist and does not attempt to be. If he wish"s to use th results of ch--mi.cal research he seeks the advice of a chP.mist. In the realm of sociology, however, the casP.is very different: tell a man that the de th rate of the Negroes is 36, and irranPdiatP.ly he is ready to discuss the matt r, write articl s, form clubs, and sp,,nd mon..,y althoueh h,3 knows th:1t he is not an P.XpP.rt in statistics or a studPnt of sociology. What ought to happen in this'case is clear:
the man ou ht to s y candidly th t he knows nothing about death rates -
is 36 high or low or m->dium? What has o"'en the history of the variation	..
of d0ath rat s? How do th• ct, th rat s of diff rent peoples compare with th s? A sensible man ought to ask: What does a death rate of 36 ;
what in the light of the exp.rt $tatis'ical nowledge and the careful sociological resnarch of the last quart r century, is the proper inter­ prP.tation of this figure 36, which otherwise is to me a Sphinx and an enigma.
The civilized and thinking p rt of th modern world is gradually and surely coming to this position. The first thing people ask of social reformars now in not how arnest are you or how great is the need of re­ form but rath.,r what do you know a.bout the ·1ctual situation and how does th best of -xp rt opinion interyret these facts. Ken recognize the fact that such PXpert opinion may err but th y are coming to see that the occasional error of m n who give th,ir life to knowing is  not as dangerous as th" p rp-tual rror of m,n who gu es or dogmatize. The facts and the meaning of th facts are then the first steps in modern social r form.

How now·shall the mass of int<?lligsnt people who have not time to be experts put themselves in position to use the material collected by sociologists in the .ractic-!ill work of reform? Ye can best answer t.nis by seeing th,, work done in reform during this century.
One of the first movements w s the English Abolition of the slave­ trade: for this the Rouse of Gammons collected a mass of statistics - the numb r of ships engaged, the -9.lllOUnt of capital invested, the methods employed to capture slaves, the routPs or sailing, the number traneport­ Pd, the d.ath rate among slaves and sailors, and etc. They eoughtthe history of the subject, the general conditions, the opinions of experts statisticians and when they began to legislate on the subject they knew what th'!y WPre doing and no nation had done eo much to stop lfegro slav­ ery as these same Englishmen w o stu ied the mattPr so horoughly.
Again take the matter or prison reform.	hen the question as first agitated there wasn't a crank in ngland or America that hadn't an opin­
ion and a panacP.a - It was do this, do that, make their punishment as eeYere as that of galley slaves; tr at thAm as un•fortunate victims of
society; make their work hard, let tl:lem lie idle; hang them, give them tracts to read, and etc. Society has outgrown this: gradually here and there we havl'! coll cted facts - not how someone thinks a plan might work but how tbP plan actually did work when it was tried; e have studied criminals instead of taking it for granted that we now them, we have watch,.,d crime instead of thAorizing a.bout it and tl:11m with the material WP have tried careful experiments - expprirn nts in housing prisoners, exp0rim.,nts ii"runishrr:ent, experiments in work und diet; until today no int,,lligont man thirks of aiml0saly gtving advice AS to crim. - he knows that this is a aubj ct for exp rte - a subject still dark, with much to b" lParn,,d, but still a realm wh,,.r.,t,r day of gu,'sswork is past. In the matt r of charity, p,:,rha::,o th,.e.re--it<>st advance has been madA. The classic examples of this is the history of the nelish oo law. At first England frowned fiercely,on bP.ggery and poverty and whipped and
 

brandf'd and hanfF>d the .,.oor d'?vils. 'l'h n ehe m lted into E<>r.tim..,nt und coddlPd and stuffpd h0r paupP.rs until it s emetl as trough all ngland would £10 to begging. Finally ti-:. state b thought 1tself t0 aakwho are the paup re, what m kes pauperism, how can we decrease it and help people to hP.lp themEelvP.s?	or thts rP.ason it now uses the statistics,
studies social conditions, organiz s charitable societies, avoids dupli-
1'	cations of work, dP.t cts·irnport rs a.nd seeks in ev.iry Wd,Y to know the
..g2_. causes of pov"rty and apply intelligirnt and scientific r"?n:edies. The world is still far from solving th problem but we are much nearer than men wer in thP. 17th and 18th centuries,
Thus sociological material is today us d by all kinds of 2ocial re- forms: th organizers of childrens soci ties,	and of schools; those
who s0  d to h lp the d af and the bling, those who want to get work for thP idl0; saving banks and building assoc tions arP P.stablished on carefully asc rtained princi l1a, model homes built for tenants - indeed this is the ago wh0n lasting and P.ffective reform has become systematic
and sci0ntifio and has replacF?d sentiment a.nd theory.
The que tion now comes:
5th. What fu!! the !!.!:.tl Sooiologica ooiety ?
I want to be erfectly frank in this•ma.tter and to say plainly that in my opinion this society has done nothing. I know we have organized - we have held meatings. We have had p1'rn.ea.nt social gatheriri s and we have talk"!d. But of actual work d.cc,,m_plished either in th'l line of know­ ing just what th r is to be done, and just haw we are to do it, and what
thP,re is to be learned as to method from the eocioloeical work of the day, and above all of actual accomplished work, it seems to mo pPrfectly fair to say th t this soct0ty has done little more than nothing. Indeed I
have s<>vPral times snriously a.ek d myself whether I was justified in attenning those m,;, t ngs and wh?.th?.r tha.re was a reasonable proap'!ct of an end of aimlPss talking and a b.,ginning of de:f'init?.doing, We seem to me in thP. first place to ha.VP. no clear id a of what the society is for;
 
we seem again to have a. 1,endency to fritter a.way precious time on trifles, we seen to forgF>t whnn we a.re diecuaeing,,aJs andm•rnne that all this is not mara theory but that dmfinite infoTI1ation of the axpPrience of others in the work and of the  general state of eoientific knowladge on most of
these points is naeily obtainable.	,'ind fina l;:; W" >J" m in the laying out of our dr>fini te practical wo.rk for cor-l"li tt•.,"!S to have not the faint0st

"'1
meeting tile subjPct  for  discussion was the influPnce of	tenement  life on
small child!'en - a subject of th	d ep.,st importance a!:d of wide influence Ther<; is a p rf'!ct m.:Ja of .r.:at. rial on the s·1bjP.ct - studiPs, maps and plans, vital statistics, s•atii:,tics of dw0llinga and occup...ttons, mea­ surements of childran'a bodi"!s, expP,rimente ae to mental a titude, in­ quiries into homf) life - ind,1ed I could without tiiffi.culty gath r right
here in Atlanta a hundred volwn<:ls of material on the point to  be  dis­ cussed.	If a sociological society ha.d been eo ing	to	discuss that subject what would on	rriasonably expP.ct th"! trend of the discuss·on to be?
They would "X "'ct first that the g,m1ral conditions of slums would be wxplain d: Bootha maps of London	ulri b	exhibited and otudies sho,m of th" pl:ysical Pnvi rionments; th"! Hull Rouse maps and pap"!rs would hav"' b"'rm taken next; aom1"'thing w-::,uld hav" b,"'en said of th"! slums of New York and
what physical s1..:.rrc.indings are nec osd.ry nd th l:,.ck of th1s8 wo ,,_d bfl illustrat"!d by th	d0a.th rate of childr n in slums; the moral demands of
child lif	w,,uld be	touch d upon a.nd criminal st tistic s producfld to show how youthful criminals ar!'J bred ln the slum,a; finally we would hav'! the evil  social eff'1cts - 13-wd talk, illagima+,e childr':!n, prostitution, per­ sonal unclea.n ss, the spre.:i.d of disease and the like.	'rhosq are sor-e
very elemPntary mattPrs connected with th	life of childrP.n in	slums which any	consideration of the subject must take up. "ut beside this the cen­ tral part  of the discussion ought to have been the  alur:is of  Atlanta: we
 
ought to hav"' h d the ma) of sever l tJ::,ica.l alleys showing the eize and relation of th"'housP,e, the numb r of rooms., the number dwelling there• and the numb,,r and ai·7-'? of	childr n; the  gen'!ral chara.cteristics of th famili,,.s, th" abilitf of thP. childr n in school or at	work, the nur.iber of. deaths in the alley in a ar, Lb  kinda of diseases, und a general his­ tory cf thP a.11,..y.	Frorrone to fivr,euoh studitrn might ha.VP been made.
ouch is what we m1g t rt>aeonably i->Xp ct tin •the discueeior.of this eubj,ct b:, a club wl.ich calla ite lf 12ociological. And yet I doubt if any mPmbt>r of 'bia society w nt from that discussion with a einrle n""w fact or id0a.	nobody ha.d etudiPd th"'subj,,,,ct, nobody knew anything about the matter, noonP. had any information to impart. About t\.o c!aye before tt:e meeting in thP midst of a bucy week's work I v;-as informed that I vae ex­ pected to discuss a subject which exp rts have been studying 10 to 20 years. And whPn out of ohePr res2ect for th intelligPnce of th se memb"rs I mildly protpa•ed th&.t two days was not encuch t.ime for such a subj ct - th"'eociety blandly v aved its hand, and said ''why you had daye".
I rPmP.mb?r laEt year at the Altanta Conference, the president of this society gave MJ outline cf tnis organi,:ation and a list of its committe s. I must conf<>ee it ma.do a opli<::ndid showing: but there wae one fact that the prPsidPnt omitted to mention and that was that very few of t ose com ittee• had done any work worth mentioning, Nor was this the fault of the presi­ dent: he nad urgPd th.,s.ociety a.gain and a.rain to do act1,e,.l work and the sociPty did att pt to h lp tha Atlanta Confarance, but of all the bad re­ ports that ca!r0  intc th..t confPrP.nce that of this clubs ,•as the v,orst. If it hurl not b"flln for the v"ri:;or.a.l work of Dr. Butler and Jfr, Uatth0ws the Atlanta Conf0rence would have had to omit Atlanta from the cities invest­ ieatP.d. I s&id to mys lf, howev r, this society is youn£ yet - r.ext f ll the wot'k will b..gin. And lo! at the first meeting I attended the club
was adopting a new constitution. l must say I was somewhati13£Usted -
what do we want I thought of a New Constitution when we have done nothing
 
under the old one. A constitution is not worth the paper it is written on unless it is backed by deeds and give the deeds and I care not whether we have a constitution or not, One of the objects of the new constitution was said to b the facilitating of the organizing of other sociological clubs in othe:tc"ities. I would as soon think of my baby advertising to teach persons to walk - why he can't walk himself,
After the new constitution was adopted the same difficulties appear- ''	ed as last year in the apportioning of work to committees. One afternoon
last year we casually d scuesed the matter of crime. In a moment the dis­ cussion sped - we swept through the calendar of crimes in 15 minutes and attacked the subject of criminals; pausing there a moment we sailed raily to the mattPr of punishment, then to slwns and education, then to the con­ duct of courts, then to color discrimination, then to the situation of-the south and to thP. Negro probl.,.rns. A library of 10,000 volumes would not haVP cov red th"' ma\ters we lightly discussed in that afternoon and then as I was opening my eyes in wonder, we suddenly appointed a committee and chareerl. it	with th"'whole matter, iJoP.s anyone wonder that we haven• heard from that comm.ittP.P,sine	It is my candld opinion that if we had appointPd a committ0P, of 100 pP,rsons and given several thousand dollars
to expP,nd thP.y could not possioly have accom9lished the work we gave them in less tnan 300 years.
The trouble is we despise the day of little things - we neglect little movements, small efforts, tentative exp riments, and throw ourselves
blindly against adamantive walls which have withstood the assaults of phil-
anthropists for centuries. we had a simple prograI\-I,o-If work laid bef~ore us; it wae sugg,·st.,d that we roakP.a car,.,ful map of the Negro slums of Atlanta
and see how thy w re situated with rpgard to the various agencies for ggod. rnis was not theory or exp rim nt - it was simply analogous to a great work now being done in .N"!w York City. Yet this society virtually spoiled the plan by appointing an aimless committee to give pastors of var-
 
ious church"!s advice as to thP.ir misslon·fields in the city. The chair­ man of the col'lllilittee protested at the time that this method of attacking the matter would not do - but no? we must have the committee. And of oours tne committP.e n"!ver reported for it hcl.d nothing to report. l::ieVP.ral times other promising definite proposals for small oeginnings have been made
but no soonqr were they launched then someone proposed something else,.a­
nother pointed out tbat this method would not r form everybody and made th sunshine 24 hours in th day and the whole plan became amended and
S" t blocked and diPd a p,.acefuly d"!ath in co1mnitteea.
·.ro sum up th•m: we as a society arA not sure wlla.t we ought to do; and we have m3de clumsyand ineffectual attemJts to do a mass of thin s without a knowledge of the facts or of the well-grounded theory of the subject. We add to our membership in a haphazard way, forcing people to join who simply come to visit; we a92cint committees and distribute work in a way ..qually accidental and thrJ·,lghtlP.ss and above all WP yield to the temptation to talk and discuss when e have nothing to say•
.i::lut 0nough of critic i em. I b1ow it is much easier to find fault then to avoid fault - to 9ick flaws in work done than to do work. And yet candid criticism has its pl ce - it lies at the root of all refonn and aftPr all in this devious world perhaps the wondPr is that w stray so little rath r than that we err ao much.
Let me therPfor, turn to the last point I wish to consider.
6th.	!,lliociety might  nd ought !Q_ !!!?_.
'.rne aim of a society of this kind ought to be to furnish accurate information to such agenoi,.s as are engdg d in th work of social rPform, to endPavor to incr aae th<>cooper tion oetween those ag0ncies, and to seek to establish new agencies for reform in n gl<¼cted and unknown fields of effort. Let me tak" up thee"'2 things in order:

ow this illustrates
 
well the attitude of many minds tow rd careful and systematic collection of minute facts. • n are so filled with ideas of reform that they haven't time to study the aousP.s which thi,y seek to abolish and oaldly assume that
thP.y know all about them. One of th'" most baffling things aoout the egro problPm today ie,the fact that somany _people in this country are abso­ lutely convincP.d that they thoroughly und rstand it. specially is every
.N°gro sup:os d to oe !!.2.!.!'.!, with a thorough und.,raLanding of this intricatP. problP.m in all its bearings. And yet a mom nt's thought will coDvlnce
us all of our ignorance. How many of us hear really know very much of the history and 1)rP.s'"nt conditon of the igh.t millions of our rd.Ce in tnis land'? we call the 11.NP.[ro problP.m'· certain bits of pP.rson,.1 PXperience. joined to some rP.ady and gP.nP.ral information and to a good deal of gossip. '!'here is not 011.e of us that doP.s not nf!ed to study tl1ououghly and 1 inute­ ly any part of this subject which we propose to work upon. '1•hie society should be a centPr for gathP.ri11g such infol'tnation in .8tlanta. we ought
to begin to study thoroughly,comprehensively,and minutely the situation of the .Ne roes of this city - we ought to become a bureau of accurate in­ formation for all facts connected with th0 ep,ro - w alth and poverty, business and laoor• crime and paup.,riam, oi1ar1 ty and refo.rm, hcmeb and streeta, migration, wages, occu_p.::i.tions, marriag and divorce, illegitimacy, education, church organizations. other organizations - vary gen ral fact which b•ar5 upon the condition of th N•gro in tnia city, pa5t and present ought to bQ car0fully coll0oted and recorded, and now and then published.
 
We should follow th.. history of alley&, comJile a careful list of the wor­ thy, study minut ly th<> abod0  and history of th cr ninals, keqp an eye

.For this work w• should havA committB B, and ev"rY member of th0  or-

every me<>ting it should be the work of ach committee to rPport some care­ fully I sc0rtained facts to this committ':le and to report in writing not oral­ ly. '!'he facts may be small or unim_iortant, they inay be s study of :i whole district, th.,y may be historic data, illustr1:1.tive incidents, but always accu­ rate, a.1,.aye r,=,lianle and always desiBned to t -''lch us morf.! of the actual situation of thA !POpl and guidP our f -at in matt rs of rPform.

SPcond, we should endeavor to inc:r ase cooperation among the various agencies for social b.,tt.,rment among the :;. egroes of J\tl nta: these at1encies are the churches, the schools, th s cred ·nd insurance societies, and the benevolent effo ts of various kinds. Our object here should be not to meddle, not to int rf re in the work of oth rs, but by spreading informat­ ion and pointing out fields of actioll WFJ shoud seek to reduca the dupli­ cation of benevolent work to a minimum and get the widest good fellowship and cooperation possible. .llother' s rn•Mtl-1g, lecturf.!e, circulating librar­

by she0r contagion through the various church cons-ti tui>nciee and communities. This society should stand r,=rndy to se,. to v ry singlP.church in Atlanta

We each might get. a few friends to pive similar books. Then this modest little library of say 25
or 30 vo1um,e propPrly labelled and cased might be place in o e of the pub­ lic schools to circulat"! fr a month. 'l'h"'!n in anoth r school for a month, thPn in anoth r. Next ynar we might coll ct anot r small litrary - in 10 years W" might thus plac in •"V0ry school hou " in the city a circul-iting library and begin to s nd som to th country schools - simple work, nothing gr at, no wholesale manufacture of saints, nothing to wave our hands about or yell, but V:ork,  Heform and Advance such aa in the past has built nations and

and empires. •h n this Pnterpriee was w?.11 start, d and in char e of the prop• er committeP - or possibly given ov r to som pecial organization, we could bPgin anothr-r and larg"r effort - b11t alo·11ly, carf!fully. we could sturt
a movP.mP.nt toward a penny savings b nk. Hot a money making institution, but a bPnevol nt PntPrprisP.to encourage thrift run on business principles. We
1 could aelP.ct in the city three or four llegroes whose reputation for honesty
NJ
nd	profity was unquestioned. If ..,iosalble v:e would ask thrPe or :four in-
terested whitP. men to act with them nd form the directory board of a egro Penny avings bank.	aoh church could be induced to hol meetings and hear
talks on thrift and ll. ttle things. '.:he various schools - bpelman, ..tlanta
s
»aptiat, vlark, aorris Brown and others could preach a crusade of¥aving at chapel exercises. At several of the larg r colored stores, a small stand, a tin box, and a padlock could be plac"'!d and a member of the committee on saving could bP plac?.d there from 8 to 10 ?.A. on wedneeday and aturday night.	ankbooke with stamped rpc ipts could be given out. ihe enterprise would flourish for a whil0 then it would die down, but we would not die down - mor0 l ctur s, morP talks, tracts, and posters, a notice in the Constitution and habits of saving would b gln to g ow and we would gradu­ ally know wh r0  to place our branches - how to encoura1e people. In five yAare we might have 1200 or f300 in deposits; in 10 y ars 12-3000. In
15 years we might hire modest quarters, use our money for a building association or surrender the whol work to a special society. othing great in such a movem1mt - nothing to take ones ·oreath away - 1t has been done a hundred times in other cities among other people and in a few cas·,s among hegroes - but this true rising - which does not necessarily call fer a con­ stitution on paper but it calls for a certain mental and moral constitution in us which is too often lacking.
I might P.asily go on naming a hundr?.d different methods of work dis­ tributy tracts, off<>ring prizF!s in th schools and ohurcl1ee, a comprehen­ sive systAm of n°ighborhood visiting, careful organized and pera:stently

and	fir side schools, tem?ora11 cate of waifs  and found.lings,  shelt0rs  fo!' fri.,mdless  gir.ls,  a social  sett_lP.mP.nt house in th"' slums, - all these and many more - not all	at once, not all
