    "section": "",
    "text": "The usual American attitude toward Negroes in industrial countries like this is two-fold. On the one hand, the white laboring man excludes the Negro from work just as far as possible, particularly in the skilled trades; this is because, as he says, the Negro will work for lower wages and does not deserve the consideration of white labor. The employer, on the other hand, will employ Negroes when he can get them more cheaply than white men, but he considers them less efficient and their presence raises problems. They are, nevertheless, always a possible substitute when white labor becomes too exorbitant in its demands.\nNeither party is apt to consider the point of view of the colored man. He needs work and being usually excluded from the union, gets his chance to labor by underbidding the white laborer, and is compelled often to regard the man who hires “scab” labor as his benefactor. On the other hand, being compelled to live somewhere, being poor and ignorant, he brings to such employers and their friends problems in housing and other social matters.\nTo most people these problems are a sort of perpetual American condition and show no particular change. On the contrary, this problem of Negro labor is part and parcel of the whole world problem of industry,—before, during and after the war. When there came to Europe four comparatively new crops: sugar, rice, tobacco, and later cotton, they transformed the industry and commerce of the modern world. Before that local industry had supplied the wants of the poor, but commerce was primarily to satisfy the desires and whims of the rich. It had, therefore, during the Middle Ages many of the characteristics of gambling.\nWhen, however, there came from overseas great crops which ministered to the wants of the mass of men, then commerce became more stabilized, the demand was steadier and the amount of goods handled was much larger; so commerce expanded tremendously. Then, too, the discovery of America gave the laboring class, for the first time in modern days, free, rich land. All that was needed was labor, and labor was procured by seizing white men in Europe and black men in Africa. There was in the 15th Century no great difference between the best civilization of Africa and the best civilization of Europe; but while Africa had to protect herself against barbarians, Europe was protected by natural physical barriers, so that in Africa the slave trade came to be a defense against barbarians and therefore expanded, while in Europe certain classes of laborers began to gain political power.\nThere arose then in Europe the modern labor movement, and when this labor movement struck America, it found African slavery established here. At first it endured slavery because it was the slavery of an alien race; then it began to conceive that these black aliens might become laborers and free citizens, like the whites. This movement, which culminated after the Negroes had helped free America from England, was finally nearly halted by the increase of the new cotton crop, which made slave labor more valuable than ever.\nHowever, by the middle of the 19th Century the white laborers realized that black slavery was encroaching upon their free land and must be confined to certain limits, while the white slave owners knew that they must have more and more free land or slavery would not pay. The results were the Civil War and the legal emancipation of Negroes.\nThis brings us to the modern world. The situation is that the mass of European and American white laborers have gained political power and are beginning to know how to use it. They are, therefore, demanding a larger share of the profits of industry; but, on the other hand, the controllers of industry and commerce have found that by investing in tropical and semi-tropical lands, they have a new chance to get cheap labor and valuable raw material of the sort which is increasingly in demand in modern industry. They have induced the laboring class to vote large appropriations for armies and navies. With this they seized control of Africa, Asia and the islands of the sea.\nYou would think that there would have come, for this reason, revolt on the part of the yellow, brown and black laborers, and particularly of those black laborers in the United States who are legally free but still largely disfranchised both in politics and by the labor movement. Such revolt was indeed foreshadowed, but before this came the World War, which was caused by the jealousy of the nations who sought to dominate the darker world and who fell out in the division of the spoils. They fought a terrible war with each other for four years, and the result is that since the war the darker nations are revolting. In China, Japan and India, in Egypt and South and West Africa, in the West Indies and in America, there is a growing determination on the part of colored laborers that they are not going to remain the victims of modern industrial development. The greatest post-war problem is whether white laborers are going to recognize the demand of these dark laborers for equal consideration, or whether white capitalists and employers are going to continue to play off black and white labor against each other and thus seek to exploit and develop Asia and Africa, simply for the benefit of the privileged classes of the white world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nTo the American Federation of Labor (1924)\nThe Black Man and Labor (1925)\nEugene Debs (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1922. “The Negro and Labor.”\nThe Crisis 25 (6): 248–49. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/25/06/negro_and_labor.html."

Post Office Money Order for $1.50 enclosed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.J. Murphy,\n\nKleagle, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, P. O. Box 612, Birmingham, Ala.\n\nWe have received few subscriptions with more pleasure than this. We have perhaps neglected our offer to comment upon the K.K.K. because it has always seemed to us so ridiculous an organization. But now that we may speak to them, as it were, face to face, we would like to say plain words from time to time. First, the Klan is ridiculous; it is Mumbo Jumbo, child’s play, silly parading, calculated to attract idiots and criminals. Secondly, it is cowardly; it hides and masks and sneaks by night; it does not dare to stand out in the open; it is afraid and ashamed of itself; and there seems to be no connection between what it does and what it says, between what it professes and what it supports. Thirdly, it is powerful. Its very appeal and methods give it power in that part of the land where ignorance is most deep seated. It has triumphed in elections, sweeping Texas, electing a governor in Georgia, showing its fangs elsewhere; but notwithstanding all this, it is, for the better South, the most hopeful mob in years. It is going to drive the “best friends of the Negro,” the pussyfooters and compromisers, the sincere well-wishers, out into the open. For 50 years the South has tried to build up a civilization on lawlessness and “nigger” hating, and at the same time it has tried by excuses and smooth words to hide its deeds from its own better self, and from the outer world. Today the Ku Klux Klan comes as an open, clear avowal that the Worse South proposes to set up a government ruled by secret midnight marauders whose object is to murder, insult and disfranchise Negroes, Jews, Catholics and anybody else whom any clansman hates or fears. Against this organization, sooner or later, the decent white South must take a stand. It must take it not simply in words with “ifs” and “ands” but with straight-out, manly determination backed, by word and deed, publicly to unmask the cowards, to stop lynching, lawlessness and mobs, and to defend the rights of American citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSocial Equality (1928)\nLibelous Film (1921)\nRadicals (1919)\nA Statement (1919)\nA Crusade (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1922. “K.K.K.” The Crisis 25 (1):\n11. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/25/01/kkk.html."

Local political pressure and team work engineered by the N.A.A.C.P., and the extraordinary thoughtful and determined lobbying by James Weldon Johnson forced the bill further than any American, black or white, dreamed. Politicians were surprised when the Bill emerged from the House Committee, and when it passed the House, they were astonished; but they said: “Well it is over now and the ‘buck’ goes to the Senate.” The Senate intended burying it in committee. But the seat of Chairman Knute Nelson became so hot that despite long squirming and excusing, he had to let it be reported. Then the approaching election forced it on the calendar. And finally there was nothing to stop the Bill from becoming a law, but the Southern Democrats and the Southerners picked the Republicans’ chestnuts out of the fire, to the great joy of Lodge, Curtis, Watson, and their kind. The Republicans never intended to pass the Dyer Bill, unless they could do so without effort, without a fight, and without appearing publicly to defend the rights of the Negro race."

Alone of civilized countries, it permits mob law, lynching and public burning of human beings at the stake. The State and local governments confess themselves helpless to stop this. A bill is presented in the national Congress to prevent lynching by national law. It was not a perfect bill, but it was an attempt, and a sincere attempt to get at crime; the least that a nation of civilized human beings could do, was to discuss that bill, to improve it, to remove its weaknesses and to strengthen its deficiencies. On the contrary, the Senate of the United States was not even allowed to discuss it. Can one call this our failure? Quite the contrary. It is the failure and the disgrace of the white people of the United States."

They refused to be beguiled by promises and hand-shakes. They said with unusual unanimity that the Anti-Lynching Bill was the price of their political support. All this is a tremendous gain. In the next two years, the Republican party expects us to forget that they have failed and deceived us; but if we Black voters, male and female, forget what the Republican party did to the Dyer Bill, we deserve disfranchisement now and forever"

    "section": "Traitors",
    "text": "Traitors\nWe have, of course, our traitors within the group. We could not expect otherwise. We are almost as weakly human in this respect, as our white opponents. Perry Howard, a lickspittle politician whose antics have long amused and pained us, sought to sell us for thirty pieces of silver. He wrote the following letter, November 23rd, 1922, to T. Coleman duPont, defeated candidate for Senator in Delaware, where Negro votes retired Layton who opposed the Dyer Bill:\n\nI received your letter of Nov. 22 upon my return from the West where I have been almost the entire time since the close of the campaign.   I confess to you that I have blood in my eyes for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and others who have used them with sinister designs to defeat some of the best friends that we have in particular and the Nation in general.   The purpose of this letter is to call attention of you and other outstanding statesmen to the fact that the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is purely a Negro Democratic organization and has always been found on the side of the Democrats in the final analysis. That organization was used by Bob Nelson and others, and you owe your defeat to no other agency. I corrected the evil in Wilmington and if I could have gone into the Dover neighborhood on the following Monday I could have saved the day, but I had an engagement to fill for Senator Frelinghuysen and you know it was impossible for me to do so.   Now, I may call attention to the fact that whatever legislation or whatever else is done for the colored people of this country ought certainly to be done and done promptly, but I insist that none of it ought to be done through or by reason of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People or any of its sympathizers.   I therefore think that it should be the policy of the leaders of the party like you to absolutely ignore and give the back of your hand to such men as Nelson, James Weldon Johnson, W. E. B. Du Bois, Robert L. Vann of Pittsburgh, and others of their ilk. There should be no quarters; and while treating every colored man with fairness and looking well to the interest of our group, these political bolshevists should be annihilated as the basest of ingrates.   (Signed) Perry W. Howard\n\nMr. Howard stated that he was sending copies of this letter to Frelinghuysen, McCormick, Watson, Moses, Attorney General Daugherty and Chairman Adams. It is said that copies were also circulated among a number of other influential Republican Senators.\nOf course, this letter had no influence whatsoever on the Dyer Bill except to give those Republicans who were determined to defeat it, aid and comfort in their apostasy; and also possibly to confirm the belief in the venality of Negro politicians.\nHoward boasts of his close friendship with that professional enemy of the Negro race, Pat Harrison, of Mississippi. It was Harrison who helped defeat the Liberian Loan by giving the Senate “information” that $650,000 of the money was to go to certain colored Americans.\n## Democrats\nOnce we hoped that an offer of our support would induce the Democratic party\n\nto curb the Bourbon South;\nto work for the human uplift of the black and lowly.\n\nWe thought Wilson wanted to, when he wrote to the late Bishop Walters promising us “Justice and not mere grudging justice.” After election he called the Bishop to him. “Er—Bishop, what is this I hear about some letter I wrote you during the campaign? I don’t seem to recollect its terms.”\n“I have it right here—right here,” answered the Bishop, proudly.\n“Yes—yes!” hummed the great war President as he read it and carefully tucked it away in his pocket.\nThe Bishop never saw the letter again.\nCharacteristic. In that body of death, the National Democratic party, based as it is on the murdering, lynching South, there is no shadow of hope for the voter, black or white, who seeks justice, liberty and uplift.\nThose Republicans who defeated the Dyer Bill, encouraged by the silence and inaction of the President, knew and counted on this. If they had made a corrupt bargain with Underwood, Harrison, Heflin and Caraway—those rotten borough rump politicians masked by the Ku Klux Klan—if they had deliberately made a bargain with them to defeat this just measure by methods of which Turkey would have been ashamed, the result would have been exactly as it has been.\nIt is doubtful if free government in Western European civilization has descended to such depths as it did in this filibuster of the Democratic party. They did not use argument; they simply, as one journal said, lynched the anti-lynching bill. They brought to the floor of the United States Senate exactly the same methods which the lynchers of Georgia, Louisiana and Texas used at home—brute force. And the Republican party was particeps criminis with them. Influential leaders among them wanted the Democrats to filibuster; they prayed they would filibuster; they asked them to filibuster and agreed to help them. They argued:\n“What can the ‘niggers’ do but vote for us. Can they vote for the Democrats after this?”\nNo, we cannot.\n## Third Parties\nWe are not the only group in America for which the Republican and Democratic parties spell anathema and death. The trend toward a Third Party is irresistible. It may take years but it must come; and when it comes, it means the death of the political power of the disfranchising South, for until this is accomplished, no Third Party can survive. Our duty is clear. And in order to systematize and concentrate our votes, we must, early in 1924, assemble in National Political Congress—a Congress duly representative of every locality, to decide on methods, ways and means.\nIn local elections we can continue to cast our vote regardless of party labels. Vote for friends and defeat our enemies, be they Republicans, Democrats or Socialists. Let us stand by Tammany in New York and Thompson in Chicago ag long as they stand by us, and as long as snobs like James W. Wadsworth and Medill McCormick and cowards like Ernst betray us.\nOf all the Republican Senators only eleven deserve our support, so far as we are at present informed:\n\nShortridge\nPhipps\nNew\nCapper\nPepper\nMcNary\nReed, of Pa.\nEdge\nGooding\nWillis\n\nIs not the way then clear and simple? Can any Negro voter in the future support the Democratic or Republican party in national elections without writing himself down an ass?\n## Lynching\nThe fight against lynching is just begun. This is no time for a hint of discouragement or hesitation. American Negroes have had little experience in winning group fights. Usually they have lost and consequently their enemies depend on seeing them fly after the first defeat. This time, they are going to be disappointed. The time to fight is not when you are victorious but when you are repulsed. The time to gird yourself for putting down lynching is when the Dyer Bill is defeated by thugs, and not when politicians are making gay promises. This is going to be a long fight and it is going to be a costly fight, but we are going to win; and the reason that we must win is because lynching and mob violence has got to go or civilization in the United States cannot survive. As Senator New has written us:\n\nThe effort to suppress lynching will be like that to suppress slavery and to accomplish every other great result that has been undertaken in this country since the establishment of the Republic—a matter of long delays, repeated failures and ultimate success.\n\nAnd Senator Reed, of Pennsylvania, adds:\n\nThe rules of the Senate must be changed so that a minority can no longer balk the will of the people. I shall continue to favor the Dyer Bill until it is finally adopted.”\n\nUnless then the States immediately and stringently end this shameful custom, the United States is going to pass an Anti-Lynching Bill. The next Congress is going to see an Anti-Lynching Bill similar to the Dyer Bill introduced and pushed by the united votes of all lovers of justice and decency."

Advertising is costly. Propaganda depends on advertising as well as other costly methods. What every great cause—the Red Cross, Jewish Charities, the Knights of Columbus, the Hospitals—what all white folk must do to get their cause before the public, we black folk cannot afford to neglect. All Americans do not understand about lynching. Few Americans dream of our daily life of insult, cruelty and discouragement. If we do not let them know, who will? Who will? We must advertise, we must agitate, we must, as Jehovah told Isaiah, “Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgression.” There is no royal road to publicity. It costs money and much money. We need to advertise as never before in the daily press, in the weekly press, white and colored, in monthly periodicals. We need lecturers and organizers of first-class ability, paid first-class wage. Now is the time to pour money into the Anti-Lynching Campaign—now or never.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Republicans (1915)\nVote (1924)\nThe Campaign of 1928 (1928)\nHow Shall We Vote (1920)\nAn Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson (1913)"

The basic thought which Henry George and his followers laid for the world was that the sum of economic villanies is monopoly and that monop­oly always in the last analysis rests on the land and the produce of land; that so long as it is possible and legal to own land, to own mines, to own oil wells, to own “rights of way,” it will be possible to lay upon the pub­ lic an enormous tax which labor must pay and which will in the end defeat democracy.\nNone can doubt but that this is true. They may doubt if the single and simple expedient of a tax on land values will remedy the growing difficulty, but even this is arguable.

This is a singu­lar misapprehension. On the contrary, we count it as one of the great results of the N.A.A.C.P., that its persistent fight in the last ten years has aroused and even compelled the South to attempt its own internal reform. Can we not remember the day, but 20 years since, when conferences on the Negro were confined to white men because white Southerners would not sit with Negroes? That day is gone and gone forever, and the N.A.A.C.P. prepared its passports.\nThe Inter-racial movement sprang from the fight we have made. If it accomplishes anything, it will be because of our continued and persistent fighting. If it fails, it will show the need of redoubled effort on our part. If lulled by false hope and vague promises, we cease our vigilant effort, the Inter-racial movement would drop dead before the cry: “The Negroes are satisfied; why stir up trouble.”\nThis has been the history of all such movements in the past. If the present movement succeeds (and God grant it may) it will be because the N.A.A.C.P. neither slumbers nor sleeps but keeps to its God-appointed task of making every black slave in the United States dissatisfied with his slavery, and every white slave-driver conscious of his guilt.\nMeantime, may we not advise our Inter-racial friends,—do not fill your committees with “pussy footers” like Robert Moton or “white-folks’ Nigger” like Isaac Fisher. Get more real black men who dare to look you in the eye and speak the truth and who refuse to fawn and lie. An ounce of truth outweighs a ton of impudence. Do not seek to mislead or lull the Negro with ancient platitudes and generalities. Let your “black mam­my” sleep and show your “best friendship” by deeds and not words. Do something. Do not dodge and duck.

This is justifiable propaganda.\nOn the other hand we face the Truth of Art. We have criminals and prostitutes, ignorant and debased elements just as all folk have. When the artist paints us he has a right to paint us whole and not ignore everything which is not as perfect as we would wish it to be. The black Shakespeare must portray his black Iagos as well as his white Othellos.\nWe shrink from this. We fear that evil in us will be called racial, while in others it is viewed as individual. We fear that our shortcomings are not merely human but foreshadowings and threatenings of disaster and failure. The more highly trained we become the less can we laugh at Negro comedy—we will have it all tragedy and the triumph of dark Right over pale Villainy.\nThe results are not merely negative—they are positively bad. With a vast wealth of human material about us, our own writers and artists fear to paint the truth lest they criticize their own and be in turn criticized for it. They fail to see the Eternal Beauty that shines through all Truth, and try to portray a world of stilted artificial black folk such as never were on land or sea.\nThus the white artist looking in on the colored world, if he be wise and discerning, may often see the beauty, tragedy and comedy more truly than we dare. Of course if he be simply a shyster like Tom Dixon, he will see only exaggerated evil, and fail as utterly in the other extreme as we in curs. But if, like Sheldon, he writes a fine true work of art like “The Nigger”; or like Ridgely Torrence, a beautiful comedy like “The Rider of Dreams”; or like Eugene O’Neill, a splendid tragedy like “The Emperor Jones”—he finds to his own consternation the Negroes and even educated Negroes, shrinking or openly condemning.\nSheldon’s play has repeatedly been driven from the stage by ill-advised Negroes who objected to its name; Torrence’s plays were received by educated blacks with no great enthusiasm; and only yesterday a protest of colored folk in a western city declared that\n\n‘The Emperor Jones’ is the kind of play that should never be staged under any circumstances, regardless of theories, because it portrays the worst traits of the bad element of both races.\n\nNo more complete misunderstanding of this play or of the aim of Art could well be written, although the editors of the Century and Current Opinion showed almost equal obtuseness.\nNonsense. We stand today secure enough in our accomplishment and self-confidence to lend the whole stern human truth about ourselves to the transforming hand and seeing eye of the Artist, white and black, and Sheldon, Torrence and O’Neill are our great benefactors—forerunners of artists who will yet arise in Ethiopia of the Outstretched Arm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCriteria of Negro Art (1926)\nMencken (1927)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\nThe Truth (1912)\nThe Black Man and the Unions (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “Negro Art.” The Crisis 22\n(2): 55–56. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/02/negro_art.html."

    "text": "Colored folk in larger and larger numbers are investing their savings and so far as possible investing in such ways as will best serve the race. This is a most encouraging symptom and one has but to visit the Tidewater of Virginia, or Gary, Indiana, or a dozen other centers to see what Negro capital is doing for the Negro.\nAt the same time the very eagerness of Negro investors brings the danger of loss and reaction. Scoundrels, both white and black, are hastening to prey upon us, offering large returns in cash and race adjustment for a small amount of money. When failure and bankruptcy follow such schemes, many an honest black man will find himself robbed not simply of money but of faith in leadership.\nA word to the wise is necessary: Investment is a matter of common-sense. It calls for careful investigation and thought. Any proposed scheme must be backed by honesty and what we may call the abilities, e.g., responsibility, feasibility, ability.\n\nHonesty. By honesty we mean not necessarily ideal and perfect integrity but that minimum of common reliability, without which business is impossible: promptness in payment, the giving and taking of receipts, no deliberate misrepresentation, etc. Without these no investment is reliable.\nIf the company with which you deal is dishonest, do not invest your funds. If you know that it is honest or if the agent who represents it is known to you to be honest, then comes the question of\nResponsibility. Is the agent responsible for what the company does, or is the company itself responsible or depending upon someone else? An honest colored man of influence may be induced to become an agent of some scheme of which he really knows nothing. You invest because you know him, but he is not responsible. An honest bank may be dealing in dishonest securities, etc. Before investing be sure you know who is responsible for your funds.\nFeasibility. Next ascertain if the thing promised can probably be done. Do not buy building lots which are under water. Do not invest in the conquest of Africa. Do not invest in a business which promises 50% returns the first month. Look into the scheme. Does it seem reasonable? Consult those who know.\nAbility. If the business is honestly conducted by responsible persons known to you and if its objects have a reasonable chance to succeed, your final query must be: Are the persons in charge able to carry on the business; have they the necessary skill and education? If not, save your money.\n\nIt will be said that few Negroes have a chance to examine all schemes with such care. In this case, ask advice. Consult those with experience. True it is that in most investments some risk is involved, but be sure that you can afford to take the risk.\nIf, for instance, you are saving for sickness and old age, you must take the least risk possible; put your funds in the Postal savings or in a local savings bank or in an insurance company organized in a state with proper insurance laws. Only a few Southern States have such laws.\nIf you are investing surplus funds where a little larger risk is possible, choose either local enterprises whose promoters are known to you and whom you can watch, or invest only in well-known and proven national organizations. Do not put your money in unknown enterprises at a distance, no matter how glib the agent is. Find out about them first.\nIf you are prepared for considerable risk and invest for reasons of race loyalty and hope, then frankly consider how much you can afford to lose before you venture. Do not take desperate chances in flighty dreams and then rail at Negro leadership when you lose every penny invested.\nIn all cases of investment insist on full and regular reports, and study and understand them. To give your money to friends or strangers and let them know that they do not have to keep books or render accounts, is to encourage rascality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nBlessed Discrimination (1913)\nBooming The Crisis (1914)\nThe Fruit of the Tree (1913)\nArkansas (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “Investments.” The Crisis 22\n(5): 200–201. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/05/investments.html."

In order to discuss the matter intelligently, we are asking you to be so kind as to give us the benefit of your observation, experience and judgment.\n\nThe theory of the public school is that it should be the foundation of the democracy of the land. To separate children usually means their virtual separation through life. This means misunderstanding, friction, group, class and racial hatred. So far then as possible we should strive in every way to keep the public schools open to all citizens, white and black, Jew and Gentile, rich and poor, native and foreign.\nIn some parts of the land, however, and in some cases, racial feeling is so strong that it would be impossible to carry on schools of this sort. But the community suffers from this and must, if it will keep down riot and race hatred, substitute other bonds of social sympathy to take the place of public school common training.\nIn a few cities it has been found possible while maintaining separate graded schools to have common high schools.\nIn these cities, above all others in the United States, there is the greatest opportunity for real national service. If it is impossible for children of high school age to work together at common knowledge and human training for four years, then it is impossible for white and colored people to live together in the United States and for different races to live together in the world. The test of the possibility of democracy lies in a certain very real sense in the mixed high schools of Indianapolis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nReconstruction (1919)\nSegregation (1910)\nSchool (1918)\nSegregation (1934)\nPublic Schools (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “Lynchings and Mobs.”\nThe Crisis 22 (4): 150–51. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/04/mixed.html."

We expect revolutionary changes in many parts of this life and this world, but we expect these changes to come mainly through reason, human sympathy and the education of children, and not by murder. We know that there have been times when organized murder seemed the only way out of wrong, but we believe those times have been very few, the cost of the remedy excessive, the results as terrible as beneficent, and we gravely doubt if in the future there will be any real recurrent necessity for such upheaval.\nWhether this is true or not, the N.A.A.C.P. is organized to agitate, to investigate, to expose, to defend, to reason, to appeal. This is our program and this is the whole of our program. What human reform demands today is light, more light; clear thought, accurate knowledge, careful distinctions.\nHow far, for instance, does the dogma of the “class struggle” apply to black folk in the United States today? Theoretically we are a part of the world proletariat in the sense that we are mainly an exploited class of cheap laborers; but practically we are not a part of the white proletariat and are not recognized by that proletariat to any great extent. We are the victims of their physical oppression, social ostracism, economic exclusion and personal hatred; and when in self defense we seek sheer subsistence we are howled down as “scabs.”\nThen consider another thing: the colored group is not yet divided into capitalists and laborers. There are only the beginnings of such a division. In one hundred years if we develop along conventional lines we would have such fully separated classes, but today to a very large extent our laborers are our capitalists and our capitalists are our laborers. Our small class of well-to-do men have come to affluence largely through manual toil and have never been physically or mentally separated from the toilers. Our professional classes are sons and daughters of porters, washerwomen and laborers.\nUnder these circumstances how silly it would be for us to try to apply the doctrine of the class struggle without modification or thought. Let us take a particular instance. Ten years ago the Negroes of New York City lived in hired tenement houses in Harlem, having gotten possession of them by paying higher rents than If they had tried to white tenants. If they had tried to escape these high rents and move into quarters where white laborers lived, the white laborers would have mobbed and murdered them. On the other hand, the white capitalists raised heaven and earth either to drive them out of Harlem or keep their rents high. Now between this devil and deep sea, what ought the Negro socialist or the Negro radical or, for that matter, the Negro conservative do?\nManifestly there was only one thing for him to do, and that was to buy Harlem; but the buying of real estate calls for capital and credit, and the institutions that deal in capital and credit are capitalistic institutions. If now, the Negro had begun to fight capital in Harlem, what capital was he fighting? If he fought capital as represented by white big real estate interests, he was wise; but he was also just as wise when he fought labor which insisted on segregating him in work and in residence.\nIf, on the other hand, he fought the accumulating capital in his own group, which was destined in the years 1915 to 1920 to pay down $5,000,000 for real estate in Harlem, then he was slapping himself in his own face. Because either he must furnish capital for the buying of his own home, or rest naked in the slums and swamps. It is for this reason that there is today a strong movement in Harlem for a Negro bank, and a movement which is going soon to be successful. This Negro bank eventually is going to bring into cooperation and concentration the resources of fifty or sixty other Negro banks in the United States, and this aggregation of capital is going to be used to break the power of white capital in enslaving and exploiting the darker world.\nWhether this is a program of socialism or capitalism does not concern us. It is the only program that means salvation to the Negro race. The main danger and the central question of the capitalistic development through which the Negro American group is forced to go is the question of the ultimate control of the capital which they must raise and use. If this capital is going to be controlled by a few men for their own benefit, then we are destined to suffer from our own capitalists exactly what we are suffering from white capitalists today. And while this is not a pleasant prospect, it is certainly no worse than the present actuality. If, on the other hand, because of our more democratic organization and our widespread inter-class sympathy we can introduce a more democratic control, taking advantage of what the white world is itself doing to introduce industrial democracy, then we may not only escape our present economic slavery but even guide and lead a distrait economic world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Class Struggle (1921)\nForward (1920)\nBoddy (1921)\nLet us Reason Together (1919)\nThe Slaughter of the Innocents (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “Hopkinsville, Chicago and Idlewild.”\nThe Crisis 22 (4): 158–59. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/04/hopkinsville.html."

    "text": "Mr. Claude McKay, one of the editors of The Liberator and a Negro poet of distinction, writes us as follows:\n\nI am surprised and sorry that in your editorial, “The Drive,” published in The Crisis for May, you should leap out of your sphere to sneer at the Russian Revolution, the greatest event in the history of humanity; much greater than the French Revolution, which is held up as a wonderful achievement to Negro children and students in white and black schools. For American Negroes the indisputable and outstanding fact of the Russian Revolution is that a mere handful of Jews, much less in ratio to the number of Negroes in the American population, have attained, through the Revolution, all the political and social rights that were denied to them under the regime of the Czar.\n\n\nAlthough no thinking Negro can deny the great work that the N.A.A.C.P. is doing, it must yet be admitted that from its platform and personnel the Association cannot function as a revolutionary working class organization. Aid the overwhelming majority of American Negroes belong by birth, condition and repression to the working class. Your aim is to get for the American Negro the political and social rights that are his by virtue of the Constitution, the rights which are denied him by the Southern oligarchy with the active cooperation of the state governments and the tacit support of northern business interests. And your aim is a noble one, which deserves the support of all progressive Negroes.\n\n\nBut the Negro in politics and social life is ostracized only technically by the distinction of color; in’ reality the Negro is discriminated against because he is of the lowest type of worker. …\n\n\nObviously, this economic difference between the white and black workers manifests itself in various forms, in color prejudice, race hatred, political and social boycotting and lynching of Negroes. And all the entrenched institutions of white America,—law courts, churches, schools, the fighting forces and the Press,—condone these iniquities perpetrated upon black men; iniquities that are dismissed indifferently as the inevitable result of the social system. Still, whenever it suits the business interests controlling these institutions to mitigate the persecutions against Negroes, they do so with impunity. When organized white workers quit their jobs, Negroes, who are discouraged by the whites to organize, are sought to take their places. And these strike-breaking Negroes work under the protection of the military and the police. But as ordinary citizens and workers, Negroes are not protected by the military and the police from the mob. The ruling classes will not grant Negroes those rights which, on a lesser scale and more plausibly, are withheld from the white proletariat. The concession of these rights would immediately cause a Revolution in the economic life of this country.\n\nWe are aware that some of our friends have been disappointed with The Crisis during and since the war. Some have assumed that we aimed chiefly at mounting the band wagon with our cause during the madness of war; others thought that we were playing safe so as to avoid the Department of Justice; and still a third class found us curiously stupid in our attitude toward the broader matters of human reform. Such critics, and Mr. McKay is among them, must give us credit for standing to our guns in the past at no little cost in many influential quarters, and they must also remember that we have one chief cause,—the emancipation of the Negro, and to this all else must be subordinated—not because other questions are not important but because to our mind the most important social question today is recognition of the darker races.\nTurning now to that marvelous set of phenomena known as the Russian Revolution, Mr. McKay is wrong in thinking that we have ever intentionally sneered at it. On the contrary, time may prove, as he believes, that the Russian Revolution is the greatest event of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and its leaders the most unselfish prophets. At the same time The Crisis does not know this to be true. Russia is incredibly vast, and the happenings there in the last five years have been intricate to a degree that must make any student pause. We sit, therefore, with waiting hands and listening ears, seeing some splendid results from Russia, like the cartoons for public education recently exhibited in America, and hearing of other things which frighten us.\nWe are moved neither by the superficial omniscience of Wells nor the reports in the New York Times; but this alone we do know: that the immediate work for the American Negro lies in America and not in Russia, and this, too, in spite of the fact that the Third Internationale has made a pronouncement which cannot but have our entire sympathy:\n\nThe Communist Internationale once forever breaks with the traditions of the Second Internationale which in reality only recognized the white race. The Communist Internationale makes it its task to emancipate the workers of the entire world. The ranks of the Communist Internationale fraternally unite men of all colors: white, yellow and black—the toilers of the entire world.\n\nDespite this there come to us black men two insistent questions: What is today the right program of socialism? The editor of The Crisis considers himself a Socialist but he does not believe that German State Socialism or the dictatorship of the proletariat are perfect panaceas. He believes with most thinking men that the present method of creating, controlling and distributing wealth is desperately wrong; that there must come and is coming a social control of wealth; but he does not know just what form that control is going to take, and he is not prepared to dogmatize with Marx or Lenin. Further than that, and more fundamental to the duty and outlook of The Crisis, is this question: How far can the colored people of the world, and particularly the Negroes of the United States, trust the working classes?\nMany honest thinking Negroes assume, and Mr. McKay seems to be one of these, that we have only to embrace the working class program to have the working class embrace ours; that we have only to join trade Unionism and Socialism or even Communism, as they are today expounded, to have Union Labor and Socialists and Communists believe and act on the equality of mankind and the abolition of the color line. The Crisis wishes that this were true, but it is forced to the conclusion that it is not.\nThe American Federation of Labor, as representing the trade unions in America, has been grossly unfair and discriminatory toward Negroes and still is. American Socialism has discriminated against black folk and before the war was prepared to go further with this discrimination. European Socialism has openly discriminated against Asiatics. Nor is this surprising. Why should we assume on the part of unlettered and suppressed masses of white workers, a clearness of thought, a sense of human brotherhood, that is sadly lacking in the most educated classes?\nOur task, therefore, as it seems to The Crisis, is clear: We have to convince the working classes of the world that black men, brown men, and yellow men are human beings and suffer the same discrimination that white workers suffer. We have in addition to this to espouse the cause of the white workers, only being careful that we do not in this way allow them to jeopardize our cause. We must, for instance, have bread. If our white fellow workers drive us out of decent jobs, we are compelled to accept indecent wages even at the price of “scabbing.” It is a hard choice, but whose is the blame? Finally despite public prejudice and clamour, we should examine with open mind in literature, debate and in real life the great programs of social reform that are day by day being put forward.\nThis was the true thought and meaning back of our May editorial. We have an immediate program for Negro emancipation laid down and thought out by the N.A.A.C.P. It is foolish for us to give up this practical program for mirage in Africa or by seeking to join a revolution which we do not at present understand. On the other hand, as Mr. McKay says, it would be just as foolish for us to sneer or even seem to sneer at the blood-entwined writhing of hundreds of millions of our whiter human brothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRadicals (1919)\nRadicals and the Negro (1925)\nSocialism and the Negro (1921)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nThe Crisis (1910)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “The Negro and Radical Thought.”\nThe Crisis 22 (3): 102–4. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/03/negro_and_radical_thought.html."

Statements were also issued to the New York newspapers warning their readers that a race riot is never caused by one isolated case of assault, and that probably conditions of peonage in the country surrounding Tulsa had brought about a situation of dangerous ill feeling.\nThese statements received startling confirmation when, on June 2, four refugees from the riot zone appeared at the National Office. The names of the refugees were Lizzie Johnson, Stella Harris, Josie Gatlin and Claude Harris, all from Okmulgee. They had formed part of a group of eight which had left Oklahoma before the riots began. They told terrible stories of the oppression visited upon colored people, said that the practice of peonage was common, and that colored farmers were kept always in debt, the planters taking their crops and giving them only a bare subsistence in return. The refugees said warnings had been distributed weeks and months before the riot, telling colored people they would have to leave Oklahoma before June 1, or suffer the consequences. Cards had been posted outside the doors of colored people’s homes warning them to get out of the state, and a white newspaper of Okmulgee had published a similar warning.\n\n\n\nForty four blocks of Negro property destroyed by the mob violence in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\n\nThe refugees had left Oklahoma and arrived in New York City possessing practically nothing except the clothes on their backs. Being members of that body they had gone, they said, to the offices of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, Marcus Garvey’s organization, where they were told they could not be taken care of, and where, according to their accounts, efforts were made to communicate with Okmulgee to prevent other colored people from coming to New York.\nRefused assistance by the Garvey organization, they were brought to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People by Mr. Edward Givens, of 39 West 133d Street, New York City. His rôle was indeed that of the good Samaritan, for he had taken these homeless people under his wing, had given them food, shelter and clothing and had tried to get them work.\nA collection was at once taken up for them in the National Office, and in the offices of The Crisis, and the sum of $51.50 was presented to them to tide them over their immediate difficulties. At a meeting of the New York Branch on the same evening an additional contribution was raised for these people. Thereupon the secretary announced in the newspapers that a relief fund was to be established by the Association, and that every cent contributed to it would be applied to relief of the riot victims.\nMeanwhile, the stories told by the refugees from the riot zone were sent out to the press and were prominently featured in the most important newspapers, appearing on the first page of the New York World, and being published in the New York Times, the Tribune, the Herald, the Evening Post, the Globe and the Evening World.\nThe national secretary then took further action. He sent the following telegram to President Warren G. Harding in Washington:\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People feels that an utterance from you at this time on the violence. and reign of terror at Tulsa, Okla., would have an inestimable effect not only upon that situation but upon the whole country.\n\nJames Weldon Johnson\n\nPresident Harding replied through his secretary on June 7 as follows:\nFollowing the receipt of your telegram of June 2, the President, as you will have noticed, made a public expression of his regret and horror at the recent Tulsa tragedy, which reflected his sentiments.\nMeanwhile telegrams had been sent to Oklahoma branches telling them that a representative of the National Office was on the way. The fearless temper of the men in the midst of the disturbance is well illustrated by the following telegram which the Boley, Okla., branch sent to the National Office in reply to its telegram. This telegram was received at the National Office on June 3:\n\nTelegram received. Representative will have all moral and financial support demanded. Oklahoma branches and friends loyal and fearless.\n\nC. F. Simmons\n\nAt the time of writing, the refugees from Oklahoma are being cared for, and the Association is ready to publish the reports of its investigator as soon as they arrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTulsa (1921)\nLibelous Film (1921)\nThe Riot at Longview, Texas (1919)\nCoffeeville, Kanasas (1927)\nVictory (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, National. 1921.\n“Tulsa Riots.” The Crisis 22 (3): 115–16. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/03/tulsa_riots.html."

Here, at last, white folk died. Innocent, adventitious strangers, perhaps, as innocent as the thousands of Negroes done to death in the last two centuries.

At Waco, at Memphis, at East St. Louis, at Chester, at Houston, at Lexington, and all along that crimsoned list of death and slaughter and orgy and torture.\nThis, at least, remember, you who jump to judgment—Houston was not an ordinary outburst. Just before the riot the acting chaplain of the regiment writes us: “The battalion has made good and all doubts as to the conduct of the Negro soldier have been dissipated. We are striving to add another page to the glorious record of our regiment.”\nWhat it was they had to stand, we learn only in tortuous driblets from sources bitterly prejudiced. These facts, at least, are clear: Contrary to all military precedent the Negro provost guard had been disarmed and was at the mercy of citizen police who insulted them until blood ran. At last, they stole their own arms and turned and fought. They were not young recruits; they were not wild and drunken wastrels; they were disciplined men who said—“This is enough; we’ll stand no more!” That they faced and faced fearlessly the vision of a shameful death, we do not doubt. We ask no mitigation of their punishment. They broke the law. They must suffer. But before Almighty God, if those guiltless of their black brothers’ blood shot the punishing shot, there would be no dead men in that regiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHouston (1918)\nHouston and East St. Louis (1918)\nA Soldier (1920)\nPrejudice (1911)\nHouston: An N.A.A.C.P.

The same spirit is evident in the Chicago Standard, a Baptist publication. The Standard is exercised because the editor of The Crisis told the students of Morehouse College that lying about their ambitions and aspirations was no way to settle the race problem. He says:\n\nSome of Dr. DuBois’ hearers could not help admiring his passion for honesty while at the same time wondering whether this fundamental virtue might not be so accentuated as to delay indefinitely the solution of the great race problems confronting the nation.\n\nWe believe that Professor DuBois, in his passion for frankness, is perhaps in danger of forgetting the injunction of Paul to speak the truth in love.\n\nWe would like to overhear St. Paul explain to this gentleman that truth with love is not truth with lies.

    "text": "Much has been written of the recent migration of colored people from the South to the North, but there have been very few attempts to give a definite, coherent picture of the whole movement. Aided by the funds of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, The Crisis has attempted to put into concrete form such knowledge as we have of this movement.\nThe data at hand are vague and have been collected from a hundred different sources. While the margin of error is large, the actual information which we have gathered is most valuable.\nFirst, as to the number who have migrated to the North, there is wide difference of opinion. Our own conclusion is that about 250,000 colored workmen have come northward. This figure has been builded up from reports like the following which we take from various personal sources and local newspaper accounts:\n\nFrom Alabama, 60,000 able-bodied workers; from Savannah, Ga., 3,000; Montgomery, Ala., 2,000; West Point, Ala., 1,000; Americus, Ga., 3,000; Jefferson County, Ala., 10,000; West Point, Miss., 1,000; South Carolina, 27,000; West Point, Ga., 800; Macon, Ga., 3,000; Florida, 15,000; Notasulga, Ala., 3,000. From Abbeville, S. C., “by the hundreds all through the fall and winter.” From Muskogee, Okla., “5,000 from the city and vicinity.” One day “1,022 Negroes from the South came into Cincinnati.” An estimate of the Boston, Mass., Transcript gives 200,000 immigrants. From Southwest Georgia, 5,000. Bradstreet’s estimate: “An immense migration.” From Birmingham, Ala., 10,000; Arlington, Ga., 500; Waycross, Ga., 900; Bessemer, Ala., 3,000; Columbus, Ga., 500; Tuscaloosa, Ala., 2,500; Dawson, Ga., 1,500. Immigrants to Springfield, Mass., 500; to Chicago, IIl., 50,000, and “coming in at the rate of 10,000 in two weeks,” (estimate of the Chicago American).\n\nAs to the reasons of the migration, undoubtedly, the immediate cause was economic, and the movement began because of floods in middle Alabama and Mississippi and because the latest devastation of the boll weevil came in these same districts.\n\nA second economic cause was the cutting off of immigration from Europe to the North and the consequently wide-spread demand for common labor. The U.S. Dpartment of Labor writes:\n\nA representative of this department has made an investigation in regard thereto, but a report has not been printed for general distribution. It may be stated, however, that most of the help imported from the South has been employed by railroad companies, packing houses, foundries, factories, automobile plants, in the northern States as far west as Nebraska. At the present time the U. S. Employment Service is not co-operating in the direction of Negro help to the north.”\n\nThe third reason has been outbreaks of mob violence in northern and southwestern Georgia and in western South Carolina.\nThese have been the three immediate causes, but back of them is, undoubtedly, the general dissatisfaction with the conditions in the South. Individuals have given us the following reasons for migration from certain points:\n\nMontgomery, Ala., better wages, lack of employment, bad treatment; West Point, Ala., boll weevil; Americus and Cartersville, Ga., lynching, schools, bad treatment, low wages; Birmingham, Ala., right to vote, discontent, bad treatment, low wages; Fairburn, Ga., low wages, bad treatment; Sanford, Fla., low wages, bad treatment; Anniston, Ala., low wages, bad treatment; Jefferson County, Ala., low wages, bad treatment; West Point, Miss., low wages; La Grange, Ga., low wages, bad treatment; Washington, Ga., low wages, schools; Newnan, Ga., low wages; Jackson, Ga., protection, schools; Covington, Ga., low wages; Montezuma, Ga., low wages, oppression; Tallahassee, Fla., unrest, conditions, low wages; Honeapath, S. C., low wages; Douglassville, Ga., bad treatment, poor schools; Raleigh, N. C., protection and the right to vote; West Point, Ga., boll weevil; Franklin, Ga., bad treatment and fear of lynching; Lithonia, Ga., low wages, bad treatment; Rome, Ga., injustice in the courts, low wages, lack of privileges, schools; Live Oak, Fla., low wages, bad treatment; Columbus, Ga., low wages, bad treatment; Atlanta, Ga., low wages; Jackson, Miss., low wages, bad treatment; Augusta, Ga., low wages, bad treatment; Nashville, Tenn., low wages; Meridian, Miss., low wages, discrimination; New Orleans, La., low wages; Mobile, Ala., low wages; South Atlanta, Ga., schools, freedom; Macon, Ga., low wages; Valdosta, Ga., unemployment, bad treatment: Cuthbert, Ga., bad treatment; Wadley, Ga., schools, civil rights; Gainesville, Ga., low wages, bad treatment.\n\nTo this we may add certain general statements from colored leaders thoroughly conversant with conditions in their communities and in some cases with large parts of the South.\nA colored man of Sumter, S. C., says: “The immediate occasion of the migration is, of course, the opportunity in the North, now at last open to us, for industrial betterment. The real causes are the conditions which we have had to bear because there was no escape.”\nThese conditions he sums up as the destruction of the Negroes’ political rights, the curtailment of his civil rights, the lack of protection of life, liberty and property, low wages, the Jim Crow car, residential and labor segregation laws, poor educational facilities.\nFrom Oklahoma we learn that Negroes are migrating because of threatened segregation laws and mob violence.\nA colored man from Georgia states: “In my opinion the strongest factor in this migration is a desire to escape harsh and unfair treatment, to secure a larger degree of personal liberty, better advantages for children, and a living wage.”\nThe A. M. E. Ministers’ Alliance of Birmingham, Ala., names seven causes for the migration: “Prejudice, disfranchisement, Jim Crow cars, lynching, bad treatment on the farms, the boll weevil, the floods of 1916.”\nA colored business man of North Carolina believes: “There is a silent influence operating in the hearts of the growing class of intelligent Negroes that the insurmountable barriers of caste unnecessarily fetter the opportunities to which every living soul is entitled, namely, a fair chance to earn an honest living and educate his children and be protected by the laws.”\nIn many sections of Mississippi the boll weevil destroyed the cotton crop; rains and high waters in the spring destroyed other crops.\nA well-known investigator reports: “Nothing else seemed left for hundreds of the colored tenants to do but to go into the cities or to the North to earn even their food. Nothing was left on the farms and the landowners could not or would not make any further advances. From the country and even from the cities in these unfortunate sections colored people have in many cases streamed northward.”\nThe centres of this migration have been at Jackson, Hattiesburg, and Meridian, Miss., and many have sacrificed property in order to get away.\nA widely-traveled and intelligent colored man writes:\n\nI recently made a trip through the South as far down as New Orleans, La., and I saw hundreds who were making their way northward. When in New Orleans, I learned that there were about 800 in the city from the inland district waiting to go, and who expected to leave during the next week. I went with a friend down where I could meet some of the leaders and talk with them. I met them, and they informed me that they were willing to go anywhere rather than continue to live like they had been. These were heading toward Chicago. I was shocked at the statement made by some of them as to how they lived on those big inland farms, and how badly they were treated by the whites. Many of these men were in overalls. I told them that they were unprepared for the climate; but they were willing to run any risk to get where they might breathe freer. Who blames them?”\n\nMany of the southern whites, through their newspapers, are confirming this general unrest. A white woman says:\n\nThat which a regard for common justice, fair play, human rights could not accomplish, a fear for our bank account is doing, and we are asking: Why is the Negro dissatisfied? What can we do to keep him in the South? We can’t afford to let him go; he means too much for us—financially. He works for little; his upkeep costs us little, for we can house him in any kind of shack, and make him pay us well for that; we do not have to be careful of his living conditions; he is good-natured, long-suffering, and if he should happen to give us trouble we can cope with that and the law will uphold us in anything we do.\n\nThe Columbia, S. C. State asks: &gt; If you thought you might be lynched by mistake, would you remain in South Carolina? Ask yourself that question if you dare.\nThe Greenville, S. C., Piedmont feels that,\n\nThe truth might as well be faced, and the truth is that the treatment of the Negro in the South must change or the South will lose the Negro.\n\nThe Greenville, S. C., News says:\n\nThe Abbeville outrage may yet prove more of an economic crime than an offense against the peace and dignity of the state. Where is our labor to come from if not from these people who have lived here beside us for so many generations? Immigration has been a distinct failure in the South; it is expressly declared to be against the policy of South Carolina by our laws.\n\nIt is interesting to note that this migration is apparently a mass movement and not a movement of the leaders. The wave of economic distress and social unrest has pushed past the conservative advice of the Negro preacher, teacher and professional man, and the colored laborers and artisans have determined to find a way for themselves. For instance, a colored Mississippi preacher says:\n\nThe leaders of the race are powerless to prevent his going. They had nothing to do with it, and, indeed, all of them, for obvious reasons, are opposed to the exodus. The movement started without any head from the masses, and such movements are always significant.\n\nThe character of the people who are going varies, of course, but as the Birmingham, Ala., Age-Herald remarks:\n\nIt is not the riff-raff of the race, the worthless Negroes, who are leaving in such large numbers. There are, to be sure, many poor Negroes among them who have little more than the clothes on their backs, but others have property and good positions which they are sacrificing in order to get away at the first opportunity.\n& nbsp; Various reasons are assigned for the migration of Negroes from the South to the North. It was believed for a while that they were lured away by the glowing reports of labor agents who promised high wages, easy work, and better living conditions. But there is something more behind their going, something that lies deeper than a temporary discontent and the wish to try a new environment merely for the sake of a free trip on the railroads. …\n \nThe entire Negro population of the South seems to be deeply affected. The fact that many Negroes who went North without sufficient funds and without clothing to keep them warm have suffered severely and have died in large numbers, has not checked the tide leaving the South. It was expected that the Negroes would come back, sorry that they ever left, but comparatively few have returned. With the approach of warmer weather the number going North will increase.\n\nHow great this migration will eventually prove depends upon a number of things. The entrance of the United States into the war will undoubtedly have some effect. When the war ends it is doubtful if the labor shortage in Europe will allow a very large migration to the United States for a generation or more. This will mean increased demand for colored laborers in the North. A writer in the New York Evening Globe predicts that 1917 will see 400,000 of the better class of Negro workers come to the North.\nAt any rate, we face here a social change among American Negroes of great moment, and one which needs to be watched with intelligent interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Migration (1917)\nBrothers, Come North (1920)\nMuddle (1914)\nDeath Rates (1927)\nFlood (1927)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1917. “The Migration of Negroes.”\nThe Crisis 14 (2): 63–66. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/14/02/migration_of_negroes.html."

Russia has abolished the ghetto—shall we restore it? India is overthrowing caste—shall we upbuild it? China is establishing democracy—shall we strengthen our Southern oligarchy?\nIn five wars and now the sixth we black men have fought for your freedom and honor. Wherever the American flag floats today, black hands have helped to plant it. American Religion, American Industry, American Literature, American Music and American Art are as much the gift of the American Negro as of the American white man. This is as much our country as yours, and as much the world’s as ours. We Americans, black and white, are the servants of all mankind and ministering to a greater, fairer heaven. Let us be true to our mission. No land that loves to lynch “niggers” can lead the hosts of Almighty God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nFree, White and Twenty One (1914)\nRoosevelt (1917)\nAnti-Lynching Legislation (1922)\nFreedom of Speech (1930)\nLynching (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1917. “Awake America.” The Crisis\n14 (5): 216–17. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/14/05/awake_america.html."

    "text": "The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 70 Fifth Avenue, New York, sent Martha Gruening and W. E. Burghardt Du Bois to East St. Louis, as special investigators of the recent outrages. These two collected in person the facts and pictures from which this article is compiled.\nOn the 2nd of July, 1917, the city of East St. Louis in Illinois added a foul and revolting page to the history of all the massacres of the world. On that day a mob of white men, women and children burned and destroyed at least $400,000 worth of property belonging to both whites and Negroes; drove 6,000 Negroes out of their homes; and deliberately burdered, by shooting, burning and hanging, between one and two hundred human beings who were black.\nSuch an outbreak could not have been instantaneous. There must have been something further reaching even than an immediate cause to provoke such a disaster. The immediate cause usually given is as follows: On the evening of July 1, white “joy riders” rode down a block in Market Street, which was inhabited by Negroes, and began to fire into the houses. The Negroes aroused by this armed themselves against further trouble. Presently a police automobile drove up containing detectives and stopped. The Negroes thinking that these were the “joy riders” returning opened up fire before this misunderstanding was removed, and two of the detectives were killed. Some of the policemen were in plain clothes.\nOne naturally wonders why should the white “joy riders” fire in the first place. What was their quarrel with the Negroes? In answering that question we get down to the real story. It is here we meet with the facts that lay directly back of the massacre, a combination of the jealousy of white labor unions and prejudice.\nEast St. Louis is a great industrial center, possessing huge packing and manufacturing houses, and is, therefore, one of the biggest markets in the country for common unskilled labor. The war, by the deportation of white foreign workers, caused a scarcity of labor and this brought about the beginning of a noticeable influx of Negroes from the South. Last summer 4,500 white men went on strike in the packing plants of Armour & Co., Morris & Co., and Swift & Co., and Negroes from the South were called into the plants as strikebreakers. When the strike ended the Negroes were still employed and that many white men failed to regain their positions. The leaders of various labor unions realized that the supply of Negroes was practically inexhaustible and that they were receiving the same wages as their white predecessors and so evidently doing the same grade of work. Since it was increasingly possible then to call in as many black strike-breakers as necessary, the effectiveness of any strike was accordingly decreased. It was this realization that caused the small but indicative May riots. Evidently, the leaders of the labor unions thought something must be done, some measure sufficiently drastic must be taken to drive these interlopers away and to restore to these white Americans their privileges. The fact that the Negroes were also Americans meant nothing at such a time as this.\nThe leader of a labor union must be an opportunist. The psychology of any unskilled laborer is comparatively simple. To the knowledge then that his job is being held by an outsider add his natural and fostered prejudice against an outsider who is black and you have something of the mental attitude of the rioters of East St. Louis. Doubtless it was with some such prophetic vision as this that Edward F. Mason, secretary of the Central Trades and Labor Union, issued a letter, the facsimile of which appears on the opposite page.\n\nOne point in particular is emphasized, that of color: “The Southern Negro,” writes Mr. Mason, “has come into our community. No less than ten thousand of undesirable Negroes,” he continues, “have poured in and are being used to the detriment of our white citizens.” There is the appeal direct to prejudice. It is not that foreigners—Czechs, Slovaks, Lithuanians—or whatever ethnic division is least indigenous to East St. Louis—it is not that they are ousting Americans of any color or hue, but the “Southern Negro,” the most American product there is, is being used “to the detriment of our white citizens.”\nMr. Mason has no hesitancy in suggesting “that some action should be taken to retard this growing menace” and “to get rid of a certain portion of those who are already here.” Was not Mr. Gompers’ excuse in Carnegie Hall a faint echo of all this?\nMr. Mason wants to be fair. “This is not a protest against the Negro who has been a long resident”—so runs his superb English—“of East St. Louis, and is a law-abiding citizen of the state.” In East St. Louis labor leaders are the arbiters of legal conduct and therefore 10,000 Negroes become undesirable citizens because they are strike-breakers and black.\nThat the July riot grew out of the meeting called by Mr. Mason (see facsimile), we are not prepared to say; but that it grew out of this attitude is only too apparent. By all accounts of eye-witnesses, both white and black, the East St. Louis outrage was deliberately planned and executed.\nSays Richard L. Stokes, writing in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat for Sunday, July 8:\n\nOn the night of May 28th a delegation of about 600 union men marched to the City Hall to appeal to the authorities to prevent the importation of any more Negroes. Among them were many of the Aluminum Ore Company strikers. They took possession of an auditorium, and some cf the leaders made speeches advising that in case the authorities took no action, they should resort to mob law.\n\nWhen genuine mob law did finally reign on July 2, the scenes were indescribable. Germany has nothing on East St. Louis when it comes to “frightfulness.” Indeed in one respect Germany does not even approximate her ill-famed sister. In all the accounts given of German atrocities, no one, we believe, has accused the Germans of taking pleasure in the sufferings of their victims. But these rioters combined business and pleasure. These Negroes were “butchered to make” “holiday.”\nCarlos F. Hurd, an eye-witness, realizes this fact and speaks of it in the article which he publishes July 3 in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, of which he is a staff-reporter. Mr. Hurd writes:\n\nA mob is passionate, a mob follows one man or a few men blindly; a mob sometimes takes chances. The East St. Louis affair, as I saw it, was a man hunt, conducted on a sporting basis, though with anything but an East St. Louis the fair play which is the principle of sport. The East St. Louis men took no chances, except the chance from stray shots, which every spectator of their acts took. They went in small groups, there was little leadership, and there was a horribly cool deliberateness and a spirit of fun about it.\n\nGet a nigger,” was the slogan, and it was varied by the recurrent cry, “Get another!” It was like nothing so much as the holiday crowd, with thumbs turned down, in the Roman Coliseum, except that here the shouters were their own gladiators, and their own wild beasts.\n\n\nThe Fire. St. Louis Star.\nHe goes on with another horrible account of which he was also an eye-witness:\n\nA Negro, his head laid open by a great stone-cut, had been dragged to the mouth of the alley on Fourth Street and a small rope was being put about his neck. There was joking comment on the weakness of the rope, and everyone was prepared for what happened when it was pulled over a projecting cable box, a short distance up the pole. It broke, letting the Negro tumble back to his knees, and causing one of the men who was pulling on it to sprawl on the pavement.\n\nAn old man, with a cap like those worn by street car conductors, but showing no badge of car service, came out of his house to protest. “Don’t you hang that man on this street,” he shouted. “I dare you to.” He was pushed angrily away, and a rope, obviously strong enough for its purpose, was brought.;\n\nRight here I saw the most sickening incident of the evening. To put the rope around the Negro’s neck, one of the lynchers stuck his fingers inside the gaping scalp and lifted the Negro’s head by it, literally bathing his hand in the man’s blood.\n\nGet hold, and pull for East St. Louis!” called a man with a black coat and a new straw hat, as he seized the other end of the rope. The rope was long, but not too long for the number of hands that grasped it, and this time the Negro was lifted to a height of about seven feet from the ground. The body was left hanging there.\n \n\nThese accounts make gruesome reading, but they are all true. Hugh L. Wood paints in the St. Louis Republic another horrible picture. He says:\n\nA Negro weighing 300 pounds came out of the burning line of dwellings just north and east of the Southern freight house. His hands were elevated and his yellow face was speckled with the awful fear of death.\n\nGet him!” they cried. Here was a chance to see suffering, something that bullets didn’t always make.\n\nSo a man in the crowd clubbed his revolver and struck the Negro in the face with it. Another dashed an iron bolt between the Negro’s eyes. Still another stood near and battered him with a rock.\n\nThen the giant Negro toppled to the ground. “This is the way,” cried one. He ran back a few paces, then ran at the pros—black at full speed and made a flying leap.\n\nHis heels struck right in the middle of the battered face. A girl stepped up and struck the bleeding man with her foot. The blood spurted onto her stockings and men laughed and grunted.\n\nNo amount of suffering awakened pity in the hearts of the rioters. Mr. Wood tells us that:\n\nA few Negroes, caught on the street, were kicked and shot to death. As flies settled on their terrible wounds, the gaping-mouthed mobsmen forbade the dying blacks to brush them off. Girls with blood on their stockings helped to kick in what had been black faces of the corpses on the street.\n\nThe St. Louis Republic has still a further touch:\n\nA Negro lay a block east on Broadway, with his face beaten in. He was not dead. An ambulance, driven by white men, dashed up.\n\nIf you pick up that skunk we’ll kill you, too,” cried the crowd.\n\nI’ve got a wife and four children at home,” said the white-faced ambulance man as he climbed back on the wagon.\n\nWhen the fire had eaten its way that far the body was tossed into the flames. Two blocks further east lay a Negro who had been beaten until he was dying. “Let’s string him up,” shouted a man. _A rope was brought and the dying black in a moment was dangling from a pole. Several “good measure” shots were fired into the body and the crowd went further on.\n\nMr. Hurd who writes with much restraint tells how he saw a man covered with blood and half conscious, raise himself on his elbow and look feebly about, when a young man, standing directly behind him, lifted a flat stone in both hands and hurled it upon his neck. This young man was much better dressed than most of the others. He walked away unmolested.\nThe violence was confined not only to men. Women were in many cases the aggressors and always ready to instigate and abet.\nOne woman, according to the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, wanted to “cut the heart out” of a Negro, a man already paralyzed from a bullet wound, who was being then maltreated at the hands of a mob.\nMr. Hurd writes: &gt; I saw Negro women begging for mercy and pleading that they had harmed no one set upon by white women of the baser sort who laughed and answered the coarse sallies of men as they beat the Negresses’ faces and breasts with fists, stones and sticks. I saw one of these furies fling herself at a militiaman who was trying to protect a Negress, and wrestle with him for his bayonetted gun, while other women attacked the refugee.\n\nLet the girls have her,” was the shout as the women attacked one young Negress. The victim’s cry, “Please, please, I ain’t done nothing,” was stopped by a blow in the mouth with a broomstick, which one of the women swung like a baseball bat. Another woman seized the Negress’ hands, and the blow was repeated as she struggled helplessly. Fingernails clawed her hair and the sleeves were torn from her waist, when some of the men called, “Now let her see how fast she can run.” The women did not readily leave off beating her, but they stopped short of murder, and the crying, hysterical girl ran down the street.\n\nAn older Negress, a few moments later, came along with two or three militiamen, and the same women made for her. When one of the soldiers held his gun as a barrier, the woman with the broomstick seized it with both hands, and struggled to wrest it from him, while the others, striking at the Negress, in spite of the other militiamen, frightened her thoroughly and hurt her somewhat.\nTo this the St. Louis Republic adds:\n\nSeized with the mob spirit, two young white girls climbed or a car at Broadway and Main Street at about 4 p. m. and dragged a Negress from her seat. As they dragged the struggling Negress through the door to the street there was a great cheer from men on the sidewalk.\n\nAs the Negress attempted to break away from her assailants one of the girls—for they were only about 17 years old—pulled off her shoe and started to beat the victim over the head. The victim flinched under the blows of the girl and was bleeding when she was rescued by militiamen.\n\nThe girls were not arrested and started to walk away from the scene. There were bloodstains on their clothes and as they passed their friends they told about the part they had played in the riot.\n\nBut this sort of Negro-baiting did not make a strong enough appeal to the jaded senses of the mob. Surely there must be some other means of adding to such pleasurable excitement. Somebody suggested fire. The idea was immediately accepted. Says John T. Stewart:\n\nThe first houses were fired shortly after 5 o’clock. These were back of Main street, between Broadway and Railroad avenue. Negroes were “flushed” from the burning houses, and ran for their lives, screaming and begging for mercy. A Negro crawled into a shed and fired on the white men. Guardsmen started after him, but when they saw he was armed, turned to the mob and said:\n\nHe’s armed, boys. You can have him. A white man’s life is worth the lives of a thousand Negroes.”\n\nA few minutes later matches were applied to hastily gathered debris piled about the corner of one of three small houses 100 feet from the first fired. These were back of the International Harvester Company’s plant. Eight Negroes fied into the last of the houses and hid in the basement. When roof and walls were about to fall in, an aged Negro woman came out. She was permitted to walk to safety. Three Negro women followed and were not fired upon. Then came four Negro men, and 100 shots were fired at them. They fell. No one ventured out to see if they were dead, as the place had come to resemble No Man’s Land, with bullets flying back and forth and sparks from the fires falling everywhere.\n\nA Negro who crawled on hands and knees through the weeds was a target for a volley. The mob then turned back to Main street and another Negro was spied on a Main Street car. He was dragged to the street and a rioter stood over him, shooting.\n\nThe crowd then turned to Black Valley. Here the greatest fire damage was caused. Flames soon were raging and the shrieking rioters stood about in the streets, made lurid by the flames, and shot and beat Negroes as they fled from their burning homes.\n\nThis district today was a waste of smouldering debris. Firemen fought the flames all night. In this stretch were burned the Southern Railroad freight house, the HillsThomas Lime and Cement Company plant and the Broadway Opera House. By desperate effort, firemen saved the Public Library Building, the Bon Bon Baking Powder Company, and the J. C. Grant Chemical Company. The warehouses of the latter ee 1,000 gallons of gasoline and coal oil.\n\nIt was rumored that many Negroes were burned to death in the Broadway Opera House, an abandoned theatre structure. Bystanders claimed to have seen men, women and children seek refuge in the basement of the building.\n\nRioters formed in gangs and trooped through the street, chasing Negroes when they met them, and intimidating white and Negro men alike, if they attempted to offer resistance.\n\nHere again according to the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, the women and children took a hand:\n\nThey pursued the women who were driven out of the burning homes, with the idea, not of extinguishing their burning clothing, but of inflicting added pain, if possible. They stood around in groups, laughing and jeering, while they witnessed the final writhings of the terror and pain wracked wretches who crawled to the streets to die after their flesh had been cooked in their own homes.\n\nWhere was the militia? At best they stood idly about in tacit sympathy with the rioters. It was not their business to protect Negroes against white men. Richard L. Stokes makes their attitude plain in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. He says:\n\nI wish to point out that in these riots all the antipathy toward the Negro was not confined to East St. Louis. Among the first militia to arrive from Central and Northern Illinois, were not a few who declared feelingly their understanding they were not here to protect Negroes against whites, but to guard whites against Negroes.\n\n\nBroadway Opera House after the fire. $700,000 damage was done in this vincinity. St. Louis Globe Democrat.\nSubsequent testimony conflicted with this statement and showed that most of the militia, as one would suppose from the location of East St. Louis, came from Southern Illinois.\nAnd John T. Stewart continues in the St. Louis Star:\n\nThe major riot ensued at 4:30, with not a Negro in sight. A crowd of fifty young men and boys dribbling aimlessly south on Collinsville came to a pawn shop. At once there were shouts of “get his guns,” and the whites crowded through the shop doors and looted the shop of every weapon and all its ammunition. A boy not over fourteen years old emerged with a rifle and several rounds of cartridges. Another boy dragged a shotgun too big for him to carry.\n\nA detachment of militia came along and made a half-hearted effort to disarm the civilians. The only persons who gave up their arms were boys. One white man walking beside me patted a large revolver in his shirt bosom. It was fully loaded. Another handed him two additional rounds of cartridges. Two guards passed.\n\nYou’ve got nothing on me,” the rioter said, and showed the militiaman his revolver and shells. When the militiaman laughed, the rioter threw his disengaged arm around the guardsman’s shoulder and they disappeared around the corner.\n\nSome of the militia were active in the fray. Miss Gruening tells of the two soldiers, members of Troop L, from Olney. She passed them a few days after the riot near Cahokia Creek and entered into conversation with them. They boasted that here “seven niggers” were thrown into the creek, “and every time the niggers came up people rocked them till they was all drowned.” She imitated their vernacular. “And how many ‘niggers’ did you boys actually kill?” she asked. They were modestly uncertain—they were not quite sure how many, but they had certainly shot to kill. That had been their orders.\n&gt; What!” asked Miss Gruening, “to shoot to kill ‘niggers’?”\n\nThey grinned cheerfully. “Oh, no. Only to kill all we saw starting fires.”\n\nAnd did you see any starting fires? &gt;  \n&gt; No, all we saw was niggers flying.\nAnd they were to disarm every “nigger” of any kind of weapon—guns, razors, knives. They got everything away from them.\nMiss Gruening wanted to know if they hadn’t disarmed any whites at all.\nThey were doubtful. Yes, one remembered he had disarmed a drunken white man who was attacking a white woman.\nSubsequently, Miss Gruening met with the Military Board of Inquiry, whose members were: Brigadier General Henry R. Hill, Brigadier General James E. Stewart, Colonel M. J. Foreman, Colonel Taylor E. Brown, Major Edward B. Tollman, Colonel William D. McChesney and Major Richard J. Abbott. She told her story and offered to identify the boys.\nThe Board was unenthusiastic and a trifle skeptical. Didn’t Miss Gruening really suppose that the boys were joking? Doubtless they merely wanted to look big in the eyes of a lady. Yes, such jesting was in bad taste, but boys will be boys. At any rate identification was impossible because the Olney troops had been withdrawn.\nMiss Gruening offered to go to Olney, to go anywhere to identify the two guardsmen.\nWell, that was unnecessary, it was rather late now—on the third day of the inquiry—to institute such a complaint. Why hadn’t the lady gone immediately to the commandant, who was present, and made her charge.\nMiss Gruening had already been to the commandant on another matter and had been rebuffed.\nAs she was about to leave they laid on her a solemn charge.\n\nYoung lady, as a writer, you have a heavy responsibility. If you go away and give the world the impression that the boys of the Illinois Militia or their officers failed in their duty you will be doing a serious injustice. We have gone exhaustively into the evidence. We have followed up every accusation made against Illinois guardsmen and we find not a single instance in which they misconducted themselves. On the contrary, we have found innumerable instances of the greatest heroism on the part of these young and untrained boys—instances in which Negroes were rescued from crowds of two or three hundred people. We have examined every body (Query: the burned and drowned bodies too?) and none of the wounds were made by rifles.\n\nMiss Gruening inquired why, in the case of so much heroism, were so many Negroes killed and only eight white men. There was no answer to that.\nMany white people told Miss Gruening that the militia had done remarkably well when one considered that most of them came from towns in Southern Illinois, like Olney, for instance, at whose railway stations were placards with the inscription: “Nigger, don’t let the sun set on you.” It was impossible, it was argued, for such men to suppose that they were being called on to protect “niggers!”\nAnd now we come to a short list of savage deeds which most of the newspapers have failed to print. Some of them though hint at them, like the St. Louis Globe-Democrat for instance, when it says “enormities of savagery which would shame the jungle were committed in the presence of policemen and militiamen.” All of the following statements were related by eyewitnesses to Miss Gruening and Dr. Du Bois.\nMiss Gruening writing in the Boston Journal says succintly:\n\nOne girl was standing at a window of a white woman’s house in which she worked. Her arm was shot away. A policeman and a soldier, she said, did the shooting. … An old woman, frightfully burned, dying in the hospital, was asked if the mob had done it and replied: “No, they jes’ set fire to my house and I burned myself trying to get out’… One of the St. Louis reporters said that he knew exactly how people felt who had seen atrocities abroad and were trying to ‘get them across’ to the rest of the world, ‘although,’ he added, ‘not even Belgium probably has anything quite as horrible to show’… About 10 blocks of Negro homes were burned, and the mobs stood outside and shot and stoned those who tried to escape. The mob seized a colored woman’s baby and threw it into the fire. The woman was then shot and thrown in.”\n\nOne dares not dwell too long on these horrors. There are the stories too related by Mrs. Luella Cox (white) of the Volunteers of America, a St. Louis organization. Mrs. Cox had gone over to East St. Louis on that memorable day on business connected with her society. She passed through scenes that she can never forget. She realized the storm that was brewing and tried to persuade some of the colored families living in what afterwards became the burned district to flee. They were afraid to venture out but remained hidden in their houses with what results one can shudderingly surmise.\nMrs. Cox saw a Negro beheaded with a butcher’s knife by someone in a crowd standing near the Free Bridge. The crowd had to have its jest. So its members laughingly threw the head over one side of the bridge and the body over the other.\nA trolley-car came along. The crowd forced its inmates to put their hands out the window. Colored people thus recognized were hauled out of the car to be beaten, trampled on, shot. A little twelve-year-old colored girl fainted—her mother knelt beside her. The crowd surged in on her. When its ranks opened up again Mrs. Cox saw the mother prostrate with a hole as large as one’s fist in her head.\nAround a corner came a group of miners, fresh from work, their pick-axes over their shoulders. They plunged joyously into the arena. Presently Mrs. Cox caught sight of them again resting from their labors, their pick-axes slung once more over their shoulders, and on their backs dripped blood.\n\nLooking for bodies of victims. Six were found here. St. Louis Star.\nWhile Mrs. Cox was talking to Miss Gruening and Dr. Du Bois, a colored woman came up and exclaimed: “There’s the lady that saved me!” The woman had spent all that terrible night crouching in a sewer pipe.\nIt was Mrs. Cox, too, who saw the baby snatched from its mother’s arms and thrown into the flames, to be followed afterwards by the mother. This last act was the only merciful one on the part of the crowd.\nThis recital deals only with facts. But stop and picture for a moment Mrs. Cox’s day and the memories which must haunt her and all others who spent those awful hours in St. Louis.\nFirst the mob, always a frightful thing—lowering in dense cowardly ranks through the streets. Then the fleeing Negroes, hunted, despairing. A hoarse, sullen cry, “Get the nigger!” A shower of bullets, of bricks and stones. The flash of meat-cleavers and pickaxes. The merciless flames. And everywhere bodies, blood, hate and terrible levity.\nAll our hunting-songs and descriptions deal with the glory of the chase as seen and felt by the hunters. No one has visualized the psychology of the quarry, the driven, hunted thing. The Negroes of East St. Louis have in their statements supplied the world with that lack.\nThe following accounts are published in the somewhat disjointed fashion in which they were necessarily collected by the investigators. No interpolation whatever is added to detract from their simplicity and sincerity.\nThis is the testimony of Mary Edwards. She is twenty-three years old, directress of a cafeteria at Lincoln School at fifty dollars a month, has lived in East St. Louis for sixteen years:\n\nKnew at ten o’clock in the morning that white and colored had been fighting, but did not know seriousness of fight until five o’clock in evening when riot started at Broadway and Fourth Street. Heard shooting and yelling, saw mob pull women off street cars and beat them, but did not think rioters would come up to Eighth Street. Fires had started and were as far as Fifth Street and Broadway and swept through Fourth St., to Fifth and on to Eighth. The shooting was so violent that they were afraid to leave home. By this time rioters were on Eighth Street, shooting through homes and setting fire to them. Daughter and father were in house dodging bullets which were coming thick. Building at corner of Eighth and Walnut was occupied by whites. Some of mob yelled, “Save it. Whites live there.” Some of the rioters went to Eighth and Broadway and set fire to colored grocery store and colored barber shop. Man in barber shop escaped but the man and wife in store were burned up. By that time Opera House was on fire and flats on side and back of it. East end of Library Flats caught and heat was so great that father and daughter tried to escape through alley and up street to Broadway, but encountered mob at Broadway. Soldiers were in line-up on north side of street and offered no assistance. Ran across street to Westbrook’s home with bullets flying all around them and rioters shouting, “Kill him, kill him.” Here daughter lost track of father. She beat on back door of Westbrook’s home but no response, ran across alley to Division Avenue, ran on white lady’s porch, but the lady would not let her in. Men were shooting at her for all they were worth, but she succeeded in dodging bullets. Ran across field and got in house and crawled under bed. Mob following right behind her, but lost sight of which house she went in and set fire to each end of flat. Rather than be burned to death she ran out and mob began shooting at her again. Just at that time a man ran out of the house, and mob let girl alone and started at him. She fell in weeds and lay very quiet. Could see them beating man. About one hour afterwards she heard someone say, “Any niggers in here?” She kept very quiet thinking them rioters. One said, “No one does answer. Come on, boys, let’s go in after them.” She then raised up not knowing they were soldiers and pleaded for her life. They picked her up and took her over the same ground she had run from the mob; put her in a machine and took her to City Hall. When she came to herself she was in the doctor’s office surrounded by friends and her sister, Josephine, who had escaped with the Westbrooks. It was about one o’clock when she reached the City Hall. Mr. Edwards succeeded in getting away from mob, hid under a white man’s porch until three o’clock in the morning, crawled from under there and went under side walk on Broadway and stayed there till five o’clock. (In East St. Louis, Ill., the streets are higher than the houses). He got out from under the walk and walked over where his home was still burning and stayed there till five-thirty. Started out to find girls, saw a policeman who told him he would probably find them at City Hall. On way to City Hall, he met two policemen with two colored men. One man asked him if he would send a message to his wife. Mr. Edwards said he could not do so. Policeman then arrested him charging him with being one of the rioters. He was locked up in jail and did not get out until twelve o’clock, when he was carried before Justice of Peace for trial. They found him guilty and set his trial for nine o’clock Wednesday morning and told him he would have to give bond for three hundred dollars. They would not let him have an attorney nor would they let him send for any one. He then asked the Judge to let him make a statement to the court. That was granted.\n \nHe got up and told of his experience from five o’clock Monday evening until he was arrested at 5:45 Tuesday morning.\n\n\nColored man, in front of car, being mobbed.

He says:\n\nI was on my way from Alton on an Interurban car. When the car reached East St. Louis I saw a crowd of whites hollering, “Stop the car and get the nigger.” The car was pulled off and stopped and a Negro man pulled out and beaten. In the mean time a white child called “There’s another nigger.” I was then pulled off the car, beaten and left in the street. After the mob left, I attempted to board a car and was ejected by the conductor. Not knowing anything about East St. Louis or the mob, I ran into a white neighborhood and a woman hollered, “Stop that nigger. Stop that nigger.” Two fellows ran out of a gangway, one with a brick and the other with a long club. I ran and was well out of the way when a Ford car came along and about twelve of the rioters got in and overtook me after I had entered an alley. They then hemmed me in a yard, where a carpenter was at work and began beating me. The carpenter then asked the rioters not to beat me up there, but to turn me over to the police if I had done anything to deserve it. The rioters replied, “The nigger takes the white man’s job.” I was beaten in the face with a cane and a rubber hose. I was beaten into insensibility and when I came to they were taking stitches in my head at St. Mary’s Hospital.\n\nObserve the terseness of the statement of Nina Fleet:\n\nHusband worked at M. & O. Round House. Was a resident of East St. Louis for ten years.\n\nI stayed with white people in the neighborhood the night of the riot and when I returned home, Tuesday, found my house had been ransacked and burned.\n \nMy husband was killed in the riot on his way home from work.\n\nHere follows the continued story of Mary Lewis and her sister Hattie House. Mary Lewis, who is thirty-three, speaks first. She says:\n\nThe mob gathered about my house shouting oaths, etc., and after watching and listening for a long time, I decided to try to escape. Just as I started to leave I saw them shoot a man dead, less than thirty feet from my window. The mob then went to the rear of the house and I, with my four children, slipped out the front door. I had gone but a short distance when I was spied by one of the mob and they wanted to come back, but were urged by the leader to go on as he had seen some men on another street. His remark was, “Let her go and get the niggers running on the other street.”\n\nI left in my house, my husband, Allen Lewis; sister, Hattie House, and a friend who was visiting Mr. McMurray.\n\nHer sister, Hattie House, continues:\n\nIn less than twenty minutes from the time my sister left, the mob returned and began shooting and throwing bricks through the windows, while the three of us lay flat upon the floor, hoping to escape. The mob then set fire to both the front and back and when the roof began falling in we ran out through the rear door amidst the rain of bullets to the home of a Mr. Warren, white, begging him to save us. Mr. Lewis was shot just as he reached the door, and I ran into the house.\n\nSome women who were always at the Warren house began beating me and I was compelled to leave there. I ran through a shed and seeing a big tin box, I jumped in, pulling on the lid and succeeded in concealing myself. The mob pursued, looking in every place as they thought for me, but overlooked the box. As they stood discussing the riot, one said, “I felt sorry for that old nigger. He begged so for his life.” The answer was, “Why should you feel sorry, Irene, you helped to kill him?” Some other person in the crowd then said, “He was such a hard nigger to kill, he was shot and then had to have his head smashed with an ax.\n\nLulu Suggs is twenty-four years old, and has lived in East St. Louis since April. She tells of seeing children thrown into the fire. She says:\n\nMy house was burned and all the contents. My husband was at Swifts’ the night of the riot. I, with about one hundred women and children, stayed in a cellar all night, Monday night. The School for Negroes on Winstanly Avenue was burned to the ground. When there was a big fire the rioters would stop to amuse themselves, and at such time I would peep out and actually saw children thrown into the fire. Tuesday came and with that the protection of the soldiers. We escaped to St. Louis.\n\nChickens were of more value than Negro, human lives. Mabel Randall, who is twenty-four years old, and has lived in East St. Louis for one and one-half years tells us:\n\nMonday evening the mob broke out the windows and doors and we stayed under the bed. When dark came, we begged the white lady next door to let us get under her house and she told us that she had chickens in the yard and we could not. We then went next door and got into a coal-house piling stoves upon us until four o’clock next morning when we went to the M. & O. Railroad yards. We remained there until 5:30 and then reached the ferry.\n\nThe statement of Josephine Jones is interesting. She says:\n\nMrs. Jones made this statement to me, that the mob formed both times at the City Hall, May, 1917, and July 2, 1917. She also said that Mayor Mollman stood in the alley leaning on the bannister of the Justice of Peace Building when a white man ran down the alley chasing two colored men, whom he afterwards shot and threw into the creek. When he returned to the street, Mayor Mollman was still standing there and he said, “Fred, I shot two niggers. How do you like that?” Mayor Mollman said nothing and made no protest.\n\nRena Cook returned from a day’s outing to horror and death. Her statement follows:\n\nWhile returning from a fishing trip on an Alton St. car, we were met by a mob at Collinsville and Broadway who stopped the car and had the white people get out. The mob came in and dragged my husband and son out, beating them at the same time, threw them off the car and shot both my husband and son, killing them instantly. Two policemen stood by, but did not interfere. The mob came back in the car and ran me out and beat me into insensibility. I knew nothing more until I found myself in St. Mary’s Hospital. After staying in the hospital for two days I was taken to City Hall in East St. Louis and from there the police and militia escorted me to St. Louis.\n\nHere is a brief but comprehensive tale of treachery as told by Edward Spence:\n\nBorn in Lafayette, Alabama—came to East St. Louis five years ago. Worked in a Rolling Mill, Madison, Ill., but lived in East St. Louis. Wages $3.25 a day. He had taken his family, seven children and a wife to friends out from East St. Louis for safety. He returned to East St. Louis and walked down the street with a white man, whom he thought to be a friend. When he passed this man’s gate he was shot by this same man in both arms and back. He ran one and one-half blocks and was picked up and carried to the hospital by three colored men. His address is 1208 Colas Ave., East St. Louis.\n\nComments are needless. Here is the testimony of Elsie L. Lothridge, twenty years old, and a resident of East St. Louis for five months. She says:\n\nMonday, about four o’clock, mob surrounded house. My husband and I were under the bed, and the mob threw stones and broke the windows and furniture up. The spread hid us from the people and after they broke up everything they left. Then we went to a white lady and asked could we hide in her house and she refused us, and we went in the next neighbor’s house and hid in the coal-house until about four o’clock Tuesday morning. We hid in an engine until about 5:30 and then we went down to the Ferry and came across to St. Louis.\n\nTestimony of Giles Bowmer, sixty years old, and a resident of East St. Louis for four years:\n\nI was at my work when the rioting began. I witnessed the rioting and being so excited I could hardly realize what the trouble was. My house was not burned but it was broken into and nearly everything was destroyed, things that I have had over twenty years. I saw many homes from a short distance of Fourth Street to Seventh Street burned to the ground.\n\nTestimony of Mose Campbell, for seven months a resident of East St. Louis:\n\nI was attacked by the mob of about 50 or more with stones and shots, but gave chase. They shot continuously and before we reached the Southern Freight House one bullet passed through my hand, shattering the bone. The mob threatened to burn the freight house so I crawled to the other end and found safety under the trunks of a freight car. Another victim drew the mob away by this time. This man was beaten until unconscious and when he revived the soldiers who were watching him raised cry which brought the mob back to complete the murder.\n\nWhile this excitement was at its height, it gave me an opportunity to make my way to Brooklyn by back lanes. I saw the mob fire into houses the first being my own, afterwards proved to be the bier for five men and two children. Among the men were Allen Lewis, Jas. Thomas and Arbry Jones.\n\nTestimony of twenty-year-old Vassie Randall, an employee of the Electric Sack Plant:\n\nThe mob had benches stretched across the street facing both directions that no one might escape. A Negro came along and one fellow stepped out and struck him, and then others jumped on him, kicked out his eye and when he tried to get up, they returned and killed him. They then took him to Third and Main and swung him to a telegraph pole.\n\nI was trying to escape with my four children and the mob threatened to throw me and the children in the river. Some white people from St. Louis, Mo., came to us and then the mob let us alone and we were allowed to escape.\n\nThe testimony of William Seawood shows the attitude of the soldiers. Seawood is thirty years old and has been a resident of East St. Louis seven years. He says:\n\nAge, thirty years old, and have been a resident of East St. Louis seven years. I left my work at 2:30 P.M., went down Fifth Street to Walnut Avenue. I then went to a lunch stand, and as there was so much shooting I was afraid to leave. The mob came very close to the stand and I ran into an alley; there I found more of the rioters. I ran out of the alley between two buildings. I met a soldier who pointed a gun at me and told me to stop and throw up my hands. One of the men hit me on the back of my neck with his fist and another hit me across the head with a stick, and I also received a glance shot. One of the rioters also put a rope around my neck and said, “We will hang this one.\n\n\nAt the Municipal Lodging House, St. Louis, Mo.\nThe statement of Troy Watkins is to the same effect:\n\nTuesday I went to my house to get what I could. While inside a man was killed in front of my house. I thought since the soldiers were there to protect me I could go out of my house. I started out of my home and the white lady told me to go back, that they (the soldiers) had killed a man in front of my house. I went into the coal shed, got behind some tubs, when four men came in and saw me, but did not harm me. Then I went to where I was working (Kehlor Mill) where Mr. Cunningham gave us a team to go to my house and get my things. When I got there my house was burned down.\n \n\n\nMineola McGee. Shot by soldier and policeman. Her arm had to be amputated.\nMiss Gruening told of a girl who lost her arm. Here is the girl’s own account. Her name is Mineola McGee (see page 234) and she has been a chambermaid at $3.50 a week. She has resided in East St. Louis since February 8, 1917. She says:\n\nCannot locate a relative since riot, several cousins, aunt and uncle.\n\nTuesday morning between seven and eight o’clock, as I was on my way to work (at Mrs. Gray’s) I was shot in the arm, as I was about to enter the door. The only men whom I saw on the street were a soldier and a policeman, and I think I was shot by one of the two. I fainted after being shot, and when I came to I was being taken to the hospital in a patrol wagon. At the hospital the remainder of my arm was amputated. No insurance.\n\n\nNarcis Gurley, 71 next birthday, lived in her home 30 years. Afraid to come out till the blazing walls fell in.\nAnd here is the testimony of Narcis Gurley (see page 236), who had lived for seventy-one years to come at last to this. She says that she has lived in East St. Louis for thirty years and had earned her living by keeping roomers and as a laundress. She says:\n\nBetween five and six o’clock we noticed a house nearby burning and heard the men outside. We were afraid to come outside and remained in the house, which caught fire from the other house. When the house began falling in we ran out, terribly burned, and one white man said, “Let those old women alone.” We were allowed to escape. Lost everything, clothing and household goods.\n\nThe picture shows how terribly her arms were burned.\nTestimony of the Kendricks, residents of West Madison, Ill., since 1909:\n\nMonday about 1:30 P. M. I passed through East St. Louis from Belleville on my way to West Madison and the car met the mob at State and Collinsville. The mob shouted, “There’s a Negro on the car, stop that car and get him off.” The motorman stopped the car and all the white passengers left the car, leaving myself and sister-in-law and another lady, Mrs. Arthur. At that time three of the mob ran in the car and commenced beating me. I was shot through the left arm. They dragged me to the street. I was hit in the back of the head by one white, another hit me in the mouth. When I went to make a step another hit me on the side of the head and knocked me down. After this, one shot me in the leg. They jumped on me and beat me. After this they thought me dead and left me. There were three soldiers and a policeman in this mob, but offered me no assistance. In about twenty minutes I was carried to the hospital in an ambulance.\n\nTestimony of Mary Bell White, age fifty-nine years. She was born in East St. Louis and did laundry-work at $1.25 a day:\n\nSaw two people burn an old man and a very old woman. They were thrown into a burning house. Monday at 4 P. M. I saw three women burned. By that time I was so excited that I ran to Tenth Street, where I met a white man who offered me and about one hundred others his protection. He had us go into an old building that had been used for a storage house. We stayed there all night. The next day I went to the City Hall and from there to St. Louis. I lost everything.\n\nTestimony of Thomas Crittenden:\n\nAge forty-six years and a resident of East St. Louis for five years. Worked as a laborer at $3.60 a day. Monday night his boss found out about the riot and secreted him and another fellow. The next day he found that the district in which he lived had been burned. His wife was pulled from her house by the women of the mob, who beat her into insensibility and knocked out three teeth. She was sent to Cleveland, O., where she is in a very serious condition. Through the kindness of his employer he escaped to St. Louis.\n\nTestimony of Lulu Robinson, age 33 years, has lived in East St. Louis for eight months:\n\nBetween five and six o’clock Monday evening the mob began shooting into my home at me and my child. We backed up against the wall to dodge the shots, but I was hit three times, once through the finger, shoulder and face. My boy of twelve years was shot twice and killed. I ran away and luckily escaped the shots that were rained upon me, and found shelter in another house. My husband I have not seen or heard from since the riot.\n\nTestimony of Frank Smith, resident of East St. Louis for about twenty-five years and employed for the last fifteen years at the Acme Cement Company:\n\nHis house was set afire by the: mob, and they waited outside to shoot him when he should emerge from the house. He waited till the last possible moment and was frightfully burned.\n\nFamily consists of a sister and brother who lived at 2136 Gayety, East St. Louis. Lost everything and will probably have to stay in hospital for six or seven weeks longer.\n\nTestimony of Samuel J. Green, age 34 years:\n\nI lived with my wife in East St. Louis; we have no children. I was born in Alabama and attended school through the fourth grade. I came to East St. Louis last October in search of better wages and better treatment from the white folks. I worked for the Loomin Owin Company; I received $3 for eight hours’ work. I rented our home; I paid $10 a month rent. Before the riot things were fine, but on Sunday the rioting began. At night when I was going home from work I got off the car right into the thickest of the rioters. I ran and they chased me, firing at me all the time. I saw the state guards but they were helping the mob to club the Negroes. It is wonderful how I escaped unhurt. I hid in the weeds and was lost to the mob. It was about ten o’clock Monday when I saw the state guards clubbing the colored people. I shall stay here a while, then I shall go farther north.\n\nTestimony of Salena Hubble, age 42 years:\n\nI am a widow. I lived in East St. Louis five years. I came to wait on my sick daughter.\n\nBefore the riot the people of both races were friendly and pleasant in manners. On the evening the rioters told me to leave because they were going to burn up the whole block, as they thought I was a white woman, so they warned me to flee. I talked with a neighbor, Mrs. Clemens (a white woman) and asked her if she thought the mob would do any more harm. She said: “I don’t know, but you get ready and leave by the way of the cars over the bridge.”\n\nJust as I started over the bridge the mob broke my windows out with rocks. I escaped because the mob didn’t know I belonged to the Negro race. Before I got out of East St. Louis I saw the mob with a rope and I heard them say: “There’s a nigger. Let us hang the S of a B——,” and they threw the rope over the telegraph pole, but I didn’t know what came of that; I saw the soldiers and they offered no assistance to the colored people. I saw the fire department come before the fire was started, but when the fire was started they did nothing to stop it. I also saw the mob throw a rope around a colored man’s neck and shoot him full of holes. The soldiers offered no assistance to the man who was shot, neither did the police. I saw a crowd of soldiers go into a saloon and engage in drinking heavily of beer. The mob burned the houses in the localities where colored lived mostly. The women were as vile as the men in their vile treatment to the Negroes. I saw the soldiers driving a crowd of colored men in the streets. The men were made to hold their hands above their heads as they walked.\n\nTestimony of Beatrice Deshong, age 26 years:\n\nI saw the mob robbing the homes of Negroes and then set fire to them. The soldiers stood with folded arms and looked on as the houses burned. I saw a Negro man killed instantly by a member of the mob, men, small boys, and women and little girls all were trying to do something to injure the Negroes. I saw a colored woman stripped of all of her clothes except her waist. I don’t know what became of her. The police and the soldiers were assisting the mob to kill Negroes and to destroy their homes. I saw the mob hang a colored man to a telegraph pole and riddle him with bullets. I saw the mob chasing a colored man who had a baby in his arms. The mob was shooting at him all of the time as long as I saw him. I ran for my life. I was nearly exhausted when a white man in the block opened the door of his warehouse and told me to go in there and hide. I went in and stayed there all night. The mob bombarded the house during the night, but I was not discovered nor hurt. The mob stole the jewelry of Negroes and used axes and hatchets to chop up pianos and furniture that belonged to them. The mob was seemingly well arranged to do their desperate work. I recognized some of the wealthy people’s sons and some of the bank officials in the mob. They were as vile as they could be.\n\nTestimony of Jerry Mayhorn:\n\nI saw the mob running the Negroes and beating them and killing them. I saw thirty white men beating one Negro. They clubbed the Negro to death. I saw the mob shooting into the homes of Negroes and throwing stones into them. The women and children were as bad as the men. The man that worked with me in the Stock Yards swam the creek to escape the mob and they stopped to beat another Negro man to death. He escaped. I saw the mob set fire to the church and to the school; then they ran. This was about seven o’clock in the evening. I ran through the Stock Yards and down the railroad to Brooklyn, carrying my three children. I saw the soldiers, who seemed to run a little pretense, and the mob just kept on killing Negroes. The soldiers searched the colored men, but I never saw them attempt to search any of the white men.\n\nTestimony of Robert Hersey, age 20 years:\n\nI have lived in East St. Louis since the 25th of March, 1917. I came here because of bad treatment and poor wages. I worked in a tobacco factory in St. Louis, Mo., and received two dollars a day.\n\nBefore the riot everyone seemed friendly toward me. I never got into the thickest of the men or riot, but they hit me with clubs, bricks, and stamped me on the head. They broke my arm. But for all of that I got away from them.\n\nI shall never return to the South whatever may happen to me here, for in the South it is always killing and burning some of our people. No let up on bad treatment and no wages either. Men must work for eighty cents a day, women for fifty cents a week, and if the whites choose not to pay that, they won’t do it. I shall stay in St. Louis, Mo.\n\nThe damning statements go on and on. Among the Negroes one finds a note sometimes of blank stark despair. John T. Stewart in the St. Louis Star draws a pathetic picture:\n\nOne aged Negro woman passed the police station carrying in her arms all that mob spirit and fire had left of her belongings. They consisted of a worn pair of shoes—she was barefooted—an extra calico dress, an old shawl and two puppies. Tears were streaming down her face and she saw neither soldiers nor her enemies as she passed beneath the lights of the City Hall, going she knew not where.\n\nSaddest of all is Miss Gruening’s account of the old woman whom she saw poking about in the desolate ruins of what had once been her home. Her family had escaped to St. Louis, but not a fraction of their possessions remained intact. The woman was old—sixty-five—not an easy age at which to begin life anew.\n“What are we to do?” she asked Miss Gruening. “We can’t live South and they don’t want us North. Where are we to go?”\nFrom the statements gathered by the investigators, many of these driven people seem to feel that the example of the South in dealing with Negroes is responsible for the methods of East St. Louis. Many of them express firmly their resolve, in spite of all, never to go back South. They will stay in St. Louis, they say, or push further North.\nHow does East St. Louis feel? According to all accounts she is unrepentant, surly, a little afraid that her shame may hurt her business, but her head is not bowed.\nIn this connection Miss Gruening supplies the statement of East St. Louis Postman No. 23, who said: “The only trouble with the mob was it didn’t get niggers enough. You wait and see what we do to the rest when the soldiers go. We’ll get every last one of them.”\nAnd here follows a sort of composite statement of the best citizens, editors, and liberty-bond buyers of East St. Louis and its surroundings:\n\nWell, you see too many niggers have been coming in here. When niggers come up North they get insolent. You see they vote here and one doesn’t like that. And one doesn’t like their riding in the cars next to white women—and, well what are you going to do when a buck nigger pushes you off the sidewalk?\n\nThis last pathetic question was put to Miss Gruening by three different editors on as many separate occasions.\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch gives the views of District Attorney Karch on the attitude of the rioters. He says:\n\nThose men have not left the city, and they have not repented of their excesses. They are just as bitter as they were, and the action of the Chamber of Commerce in forcing these Negroes down their throats is only inflaming the men who participated in the riot.\n\nThe District Attorney told of seeing a man on a street car exhibit a revolver openly Thursday night, and remark that “it had killed niggers, and would kill some more as soon as the damned militia leaves.” Other men near by expressed similar sentiments, he added. They were laboring men, apparently going home from work.\nKarch emphatically confirmed the statements made to the Post-Dispatch Tuesday by City Clerk Whalen, who is president of the Central Trades and Labor Union of East St. Louis, to the effect that large employers of labor had given marked and continuous preference to Negroes.\n“Their attitude for some time has been that they would give jobs to white men when they couldn’t get any more Negroes,” Karch declared. “This, as Mr. Whalen said, is because the Negroes will not unionize. Before the tenseness of this situation is relieved, these employers must convince the laboring whites that they will be given preference over imported blacks in applying for work. Instead of doing that, they are declaring they will put all the Negroes back to work, and protect them, if they have to keep troops here indefinitely. That kind of flamboyant talk only angers the men who should be quieted.”\n“As long as the heads of these big plants break up strikes by importing Negro strikebreakers, so long can they expect to have race riots. This is no defense for the rioters; there is no defense for them. It is just a fact that when a man’s family is hungry his sense of justice doesn’t operate very accurately.”\nPrejudice is a bad thing. But prejudice in the hands of Organized Labor in America! The Central Trades and Labor Union of East St. Louis has perpetrated a grim jest. Its motto as one may see by glancing back at page 221, is “Labor omnia vincit.” Latin is apt to be a bit obscure, so we translate: “Labor conquers everything.” It does. In East St. Louis it has conquered Liberty, Justice, Mercy, Law and the Democracy which is a nation’s vaunt.\nAnd what of the Federal Government?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Crusade (1914)\nSt. Louis (1916)\nMemphis or East St. Louis?

It was this same Department of Justice which discovered German plots among Negroes of the South, raising a furor which was promptly drowned out by loud reassurances from the white South itself.

    "text": "We Negroes ever face it.\nWe cannot escape it.\nWe must continually choose between insult and injury: no schools or separate schools; no travel or “Jim Crow” travel; homes with disdainful neighbors or homes in slums.\nWe continually submit to segregated schools, “Jim Crow” cars, and isolation, because it would be suicide to go uneducated, stay at home, and live in the “tenderloin.”\nYet, when a new alternative of such choice faces us it comes with a shock and almost without thinking we rail at the one who advises the lesser of two evils.\nThus it was with many hasty edi­tors in the case of the training camp for Negro officers which Dr. J. E. Spingarn is seeking to establish.\nDoes Dr. Spingarn believe in a “Jim Crow” training camp? Certainly not, and he has done all he could to induce the government to admit Negroes to all training camps.\nThe government has so far courteously refused.\nBut war is imminent.\nIf war comes to-morrow Negroes will be compelled to enlist under white officers because (save in very few cases) no Negroes have had the requisite training.\nWe must choose the insult of a separate camp and the irreparable injury of strengthening the present custom of putting no black men in positions of authority.\nOur choice is as clear as noonday.\nGive us the camp.\nLet not 200, but 2,000 volunteer.\nWe did not make the damnable dilemma.\nOur enemies made that.\nWe must make the choice else we play into their very claws.\nIt is a case of camp or no officers.\nGive us the officers.\nGive us the camp.\nA word to those who object:\n\nThe army does not wish this camp. It wishes the project to fail. General Wood refuses to name date or place until 200 apply. The reason is obvious. Up to March 8, sixty-nine men have applied.\nThe camp is a temporary measure lasting four weeks and designed to FIGHT not encourage discrimina­tion in the army. The New York Negro regiment could not find enough qualified Negroes for its commissions. W e want trained colored officers. This camp will help furnish them.\nThe South does not want the Negro to receive military training of any sort. For that reason the general staff reduced its estimate from 900,000 to 500,000 soldiers—they expect to EXCLUDE Negroes!\nIf war comes, conscription will follow. All pretty talk about not vol­unteering will become entirely aca­demic. This is the mistake made by the Baltimore AFRO-AMERICAN, the Chicago DEFENDER, the New York NEWS, and the Cleveland GAZETTE. They assume a choice between volunteering and not volunteer­ing. The choice will be between con­scription and rebellion.\n\nCan the reader conceive of the pos­sibility of choice? The leaders of the colored race who advise them to add treason and rebellion to the other grounds on which the South urges discrimination against them would hardly be doing a service to those whom they profess to love. No, there is only one thing to do now, and that is to organize the colored people for leadership and service, if war should come. A thousand commissioned officers of colored blood is something to work for.\nGive us the camp!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOfficers (1917)\nA Statement (1919)\nThe “Jim Crow” Argument (1913)\nBlessed Discrimination (1913)\nThe Newer South (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1917. “The Perpetual Dilemma.”\nThe Crisis 13 (6): 270–71. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/13/06/perpetual_dilemma.html."

    "text": "The following letter was sent to Honorable Charles Evans Hughes, September 28, 1916:\nSir:\nAs an organization representing the Negro race and thousands of its friends we are deeply interested in the presidential election.\nDuring the last campaign, believing firmly that the Republican Party and its leaders had systematically betrayed the interests of colored people, many of our members did what they could to turn the colored vote toward Mr. Wilson. We received from him a promise of justice and sincere endeavor to forward their interests. We need scarcely to say that Mr. Wilson grievously disappointed us.\nWe find ourselves again facing a presidential campaign with but indifferent choice. We have waited for some time to gather from your writings and speeches something of your attitude toward the colored people. We have seen little. We are told, of course, in general that you have no race policy and propose to treat all Americans squarely. If Negroes were Americans—if they had a reasonable degree of rights and privileges we could ask no more than this; but being as they are, members of a segregated class and struggling against tremendous prejudices, disabilities and odds, we must for their own salvation and the salvation of our country ask for more than such treatment as is today fair for other races. We must continually demand such positive action as will do away with their disabilities. Lynching is a national evil of which Negroes are the chief victims. It is perhaps the greatest disgrace from which this country suffers, and yet we find you and other men of influence silent in the matter. A republic must be based upon universal suffrage or it is not a republic; and yet, while you seem anxious to do justice toward women, we hear scarcely a word concerning those disfranchised masses of the South whose stolen votes are used to make Rotten Boroughs of a third of the nation and thus distort and ruin the just distribution of political power. Caste restrictions, fatal to Christian civilization and modern conceptions of decency, are slowly, but forcibly, entering this land and making black folk the chief victims. There should be outspoken protest against segregation by race in the civil service, caste in public travel and in other public accommodations. As Negroes and as their friends; as Americans; as persons whose fathers have striven for the good of this land and who ourselves have tried unselfishly to make America the land of just ideals, we write to ask if you do not think it possible to make to the colored and white people of America some statement of your attitude toward this grievous problem such as will allow us at least to vote with intelligence.\nIt seems to us that we have a right to know your attitude toward lynching, disfranchisement, caste and race hatred, and that without this knowledge it will be impossible for us to cast a discriminating vote. We are especially anxious to know how far the possession of a dark face or a drop of Negro blood will in your administration act as a bar to appointment to office and how far the inherited prejudice of many Americans shall veto the rights and civil privileges of others.\nWe trust, Sir, that you will not regard this statement and request as beyond the courtesy due you or as adding too much to the burdens of a public man.\nWe beg to remain, Sir,     Very respectfully yours,\n\n\nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\n(Signed) J.

Where is the South in this list? Where would you expect it to be? At the end, of course, with Mr. Vardaman’s State leading the rear and Mr. Tillman’s State next to it and Georgia, Alabama and Texas, of lynching fame, ranking close to the end. This is not only the natural fruit of slavery; it is the fruit of present political and legal conditions in the South. We have it out of the South’s own mouth. The Macon Telegraph writes of the recent Primary in Georgia: “The ‘red shirt’ days in South Carolina; the rottenest days during the period of the Hamburg riot; the slime of the most nauseating politics ever known in Georgia—none of it even nearly borders on to the method of campaigning now going on in behalf of Hugh M. Dorsey.”\nThe Primary in South Carolina was just as bad if not worse. It is this kind of oligarchy that the South wants perpetuated; it is for this reason that the Southern women in the Suffrage convention at Atlantic City were so strenuously opposed to a National Suffrage Amendment. Suffrage based on National law will eventually be enforced by the National Government; but Suffrage based on Georgia law will be enforced as Georgia is now enforcing it. Yet the Northern women in the Suffrage convention were blind as bats as to the real animus behind the fight of Laura Clay and Kate Gordon. The woman correspondent of the New Republic grows enthusiastic, shrill and almost inarticulate over one of them: “We gloried in her. We revelled in her!”\nOf course we did, and if some poor, old black woman, disfranchised and deprived of her rightful support by a lyncher’s mob which had made a mistake, had happened into that convention “we” would not have “gloried” or “revelled” in her. We would have passed the hat and told her to go home and not agitate for the “Impossible.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Newest South (1913)\nSlavery (1922)\nBrothers, Come North (1920)\nThe Newer South (1926)\nRemember (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Southern Civilization.”\nThe Crisis 13 (1): 11–12. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/13/01/southern_civilization.html."

That sort of a foundation is too weak; it cannot last. So is it not better to keep before our people ideas and thoughts of culture, refinement, service and love and in that way build our progress on a sure foundation?\n\nNo one wishes more than The Crisis that “culture, refinement, service and love” should triumph in the world; but we continually fear lest easy-going young folk should loll in their parlors toasting their toes and expect the horror of the world’s blood sacrifice to be accomplished by someone else while they are practising “refinement and love.” Terrible as it may be, the awful fact faces the colored races in this world: That no human group has ever achieved freedom without being compelled to murder thousands of members of other groups who were determined that they should be slaves. Let us hope and deeply pray that this may not happen in the case of colored folk; but at the same time let us set our faces grimly toward the fact, with unwinking eyes, that it may be necessary.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Lube Martin is a colored man who lives at Murray, Calloway County, Ky., in the regions where the night riders have had full sway. In the same city lived a white man, Guthrie Diuguid. He was the policeman of the town. In the spring of 1916 he declared that certain white people had hired Lube Martin to kill him. He was so insistent in repeating this story that his friends feared he was “cracked.” Finally, when he went before the city council and demanded protection, he was forced to resign his position. He then became a road supervisor and apparently forgot the alleged plot against his life. Diuguid, however, had meanwhile sent word to Martin that he would kill him on sight. Martin succeeded in dodging him for a long time. Finally, on January 9, 1917, the two met. Diuguid shot at Martin four or five times and when Martin saw that further dodging was impossible, he shot and killed Diuguid.\nLube Martin was immediately arrested and assigned a white attorney, J. P. Holt. Holt was a shrewd man and took his job seriously. He told the court that two principal witnesses were not present to testify and that he wanted a continuance of the case. The Kentucky law is curious in this respect: if a defendant asks for a continuation because of the absence of a material witness, the prosecution may keep the trial from being postponed by admitting the alleged testimony of the absent person as TRUE. This the prosecution did in Martin’s case, thereby admitting that Diuguid had threatened to kill Martin and had drawn a pistol on him first. The trial, therefore, was fixed to go on the next day and undoubtedly the black man would have been condemned to death; but Holt found another witness and declared that that witness would swear that Diuguid shot first when he saw Martin. This the prosecution could not admit.\n\n\n\nThe Court House, Murray, KY\n\n\nOn the morning of January 10, one thousand of the mountain whites came into Murray to see Martin condemned to death and then to lynch him. They crowded into the new $75,000 court house and heard Judge Charles H. Bush say that the trial had been postponed and that the prisoner had been taken to Hopkinsville. Immediately the mob went wild.\n“Give us the nigger or we’ll hang the judge,” they said.\n\n\n\nGovernor Stanley of Kentucky\n\n\nEvidently the judge believed what they said, because he forthwith signed an order to bring the prisoner back to town. Meantime, somebody thought of the governor. They telephoned to Louisville and found him, but the governor had no militia because the militia had been sent to Texas. He came, however, without militia. When he walked into Murray next morning, he saw the judge and the timid commonwealth’s attorney, D. P. Smith. The stores had been open all night and when the governor got to the courthouse, things looked pretty bad. But Governor Stanley took his stand boldly and told the mob the difference between a savage and a civilized community. He asserted that every member of a lynching mob was a murderer. He told them that the judge and the commonwealth’s attorney had agreed to produce the accused there and that he had countermanded the order, that he alone was responsible, and that if anybody was going to be lynched, it would have to be he. The mad and hungry looking backwoodsmen were impressed.\nOne of them yelled, “Say, Gov., you’ve got the guts; I’m fer yer.”\nFinally, it was agreed that the trial should be postponed until February 19.\nThus Lube Martin has been saved from the mob—at least temporarily. As to justice for a man who killed his assailant in self-defense, that, even in Kentucky, is quite another story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Moral Void (1917)\nCowardice (1916)\nLynching (1928)\nPeonage (1916)\nThe Lynching Industry (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 1917.\n“The Attempted Lynching of Lube Martin: An N.A.A.C.P.\nInvestigation.” The Crisis 13 (5): 226–27. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/13/05/attempted_lynching.html."

    "text": "The most sinister power that the N.R.A. has re-inforced is the American Federation of Labor. The American Federation of Labor never did represent the labor movement and represents it less today than in the past. It is a petty bourgois organization, with all the ideals of the small capitalists and with the desire and program to increase the wages of a small class of skilled and favorably situated laborers at the expense of the mass of the working people. The A. F. of L. has discriminated against Jews, Italians, Slovaks and Negroes, and it has discriminated against white Americans, whenever chance or opportunity came; high wage for the few even if that involved aiding in the exploitation of common labor and being bribed by employers to keep labor peace when the mass of laborers is receiving less than the living wage and indecent treatment. The extremes to which this movement has gone is illustrated by the engineers who started a bank in Cleveland to perform the same kind of functions that any capitalist bank would form and which ran a mine in West Virginia with non-Union labor.\nThe A. F. of L. has from the beginning of its organization stood up and lied brazenly about its attitude toward Negro labor. They have affirmed and still affirm that they wish to organize Negro labor when this is a flat and proven falsehood. They do not wish to organize Negroes. They keep Negroes out of every single organization where they can. They allow any organization under the Federation to exclude Negroes on any pretense and make no protest. Their officials have repeatedly refused to sit down with black men and discuss ways and means by which race prejudice within the labor movement could be abated. Whenever any trade union within the A. F. of L. does receive Negro laborers, it does so against the policy of the A. F. of L. leaders, and it is encouraged to discriminate against the Negroes even if they are in the ranks of union labor.\nNegro workers have been and are continually traduced and libeled by these so-called labor leaders, and yet today this organization is the one that is being set up to “represent” labor. Of the twenty or thirty millions of laborers in the United States, the American Federation of Labor does not adequately or decently represent a single million. It is this fact that gives sinister reinforcement to the demand on the part of the employers for the open shop. No one is deceived by the motives behind the steel trust and Henry Ford. They sought the open shop because there are bigger profits in unorganized labor. But, on the other hand, the only chance for the Negro to find work and the only chance for millions of white workers to find employment is in those industrial institutions that are not dominated by William Green and his contemptible monopoly of recognized labor effort.\nIt is too bad that the rank and file or the American Federation of Labor cannot see the kind of bureaucracy by which they are ruled and give at least some aid and comfort to the recurrent demands inside the organization for reform. Unless they do this, some time there is coming a great wave of demand from the mass of exploited laborers for an organization which represents their injuries and their wishes. And that new organization is going to sweep the A. F. of L. off the face of the earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRailroad Unions (1921)\nTo the American Federation of Labor (1924)\nOrganized Labor (1912)\nEugene Debs (1926)\nWhite Co-Workers (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “The A.F.

We did not question then but what universal suffrage was able to bring to all, popular education, industrial efficiency and economic justice, by slow but progressive reform movements.

That on the contrary, the economic and industrial organization of the world is such that democracy, even among the more advanced white nations, is singularly ineffective. And that if the masses are going to achieve incomes adequate to a decent livelihood, and the economic justice which is the only basis of a broad human culture, a revolution in the control and method of our present political activities must come.\nIf this conviction is true, and it is shared by so large a proportion of the best and keenest thought of the world, that it can hardly today be questioned, then the problem of the Negro voter becomes dynamic rather than static, and relative rather than absolute; that is, he has to ask himself: What am I going to do with my vote and my work and my other activities, so that I may not simply escape racial and class discrimination, but may also help the world in its progress toward human emancipation?\nManifestly, this is no easy task, particularly in a country like the United States, where the Negro forms a decided minority, and is discriminated against in almost every particular, by all the elements of the population,—the artist and the religious worker; especially by the employer and organizer of industry; and last but not least by the whole of the white laboring class."

They stand essentially for the same thing. They represent a dictatorship of organized industry which is running the United States for the benefit of the owners of wealth. Perhaps the most characteristic thing of our present era is the frankness with which this truth is today openly admitted. What difference does it make, then, whether the Negro votes the Republican or Democratic ticket? He is voting for the same essential dictatorship. Both parties agree in a policy which nullifies the popular vote, limits the wages of common labor, monopolizes capital and land, supports the state mainly by taxes upon the poor, and increases the income of the rich by privilege and administration.\nThird parties of various kinds bid for the Negro vote; reform movements, Populist and Socialist parties, and today, the Communists. The ability of any of these parties to carry elections according to present conditions is from the very start hindered and made almost impossible by the rotten boroughs of the South, based on Negro disfranchisement. This fact, from time to time, the Negro has impressed upon Third Parties. But from the day of the Bull Moose, down to that of the L. I. P. A., no effective attack upon this situation has been even initiated, while the more radical parties openly ask the Negro to join white labor in mass action to gain their ends by force."

    "text": "White Labor\nBut as The Crisis has continually pointed out, the white laboring class and the middle class of clerks and merchants and engineers are the bitterest and most implacable enemies of Negroes. It is to no purpose that thoughtful observers remind Negroes that the Negro prejudice of laborers and clerks is the result of ignorance and often of the machination of the employing and investing classes. That fact, of which the Negro is perfectly aware, can have no essential effect upon his actions, because in the present organization or industry he must get his living mainly as a concession from the employer and the capitalist and this will remain true in his case so long as his fellow white laborer will not permit him to enter industry on equal terms, or consent to fight with him for higher wages and more decent conditions of work. Thus the Negro worker has absolutely no choice but to accept what the employers offer, or starve. There are today among Negroes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57,000\nCoal Miners.\n\n\n12,000\nMasons.\n\n\n32,000\nCarpenters.\n\n\n18,000\nStationary firemen.\n\n\n26,000\nMechanics.\n\n\n13,000\nPlasterers.\n\n\n130,000\nIn iron and steel industries.\n\n\n100,000\nRailway Laborers.\n\n\n5,000\nPlumbers.\n\n\n8,000\nMolders.\n\n\n\nAll these black men and thousands of others have gotten their jobs and are keeping them by fighting the effort of white labor to keep bread and butter from their mouths. In most of the more highly skilled and better paid branches of labor and industry, the white workers have been successful, and today, no matter what the skill of a colored locomotive engineer might be, or a colored telegrapher, or a chemist, or an engraver, or an electrician, or a business manager, the doors of most industrial organizations are slammed fast in his face, simply and solely on account of his color.\nIn those semi-skilled and unskilled jobs which he holds, he has gotten them only by scabbing and underbidding the white worker. And where he is a member of a trade union, he is tolerated only to keep him from working for less wages than the whites, and he is subjected to every discrimination within the Union that the Union dare apply. Naturally, there are exceptions to these sweeping general statements, but in the main, they are true.\nWhen, therefore, Third Parties appeal to the clerks and laborers of the land, they appeal to potential enemies of the black man as things are today. Or if, as in the case of the Communists, an appeal is made on the basis of no racial discrimination, white labor does not give the slightest response to the appeal, and the Communist vote is less than negligible."

    "section": "Opportunism",
    "text": "Opportunism\nUnder these circumstances, how is a Negro to vote? Manifestly, his voting program has got to be purely opportunist. In the long run, and in the end, he wants his vote to help in the re-organization of society, and particularly the re-organization of the economic basis of society upon which social development depends. From this great end, he must never swerve. But in approaching it, he must see to it that his interests, his essential rights and his well being are not deliberately sacrificed, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the well being of mankind. No one has a right to make the black man a bloody sacrifice on the altar of advance simply because he is weak and unable to defend himself, and when such sacrifice is absolutely uncalled for. Recognizing then that political action seeking reform movements are just and necessary steps toward the realization of permanent betterment of man, the Negro can carefully follow such a program of reform as Karl Marx laid down in his Communist Manifesto, recognizing that such steps may prove pitably inadequate to the great end of re-making this world, but, nevertheless, for a minority they are steps forward and as such, better than inaction or retreat.\nSuch a program for American Negroes includes universal education of youth, adult education, the taxation of the rich with the avowed purpose of redistributing income, the appropriation by the state of the unearned increment on land values and other monopoly, the reduction of the tariff on imports, the protection of the ballot and proportional representation for minorities, the prevention of crime and reform of criminals, minimum wage standards, limitation of the right of inheritance, state control of banking and credit, increasing state ownership of industry, especially of railroads and public service corporations,\nWhenever and wherever there is a chance for the Negro to cast his vote in favor of such measures, he should do so, only insisting that in their application there be no discrimination on account of color or race. Beyond this, when a Third Party asks for his vote, he should insist upon specific promises to attack and abate color discrimination throughout the country and in every particular, and in the absence of such promises, he should refuse categorically any political support. When such promises are made his next step is to see whether those who promise have the power to fulfill.\n## Communists\nIt makes no difference how much the Communist Party may promise the Negro, so long as the white people of the country refuse support, it is idiotic for the colored people to throw their votes away. Moreover, in the case of the Communists there is acute danger that the Negro vote will be deliberately sacrificed to ulterior purposes. For instance, there are in the United States 700,000 Negro farm tenants. Some of them rent land on a money basis and are as well off or as poorly off as the corresponding class of whites. But at least 400,000 of these tenants are share croppers, and their economic condition, under the laws and usages of the South, is but little removed from slavery. Moreover, there is naturally a much larger number of white share croppers whose situation is practically almost as bad as that of the Negroes.\nWithout plan or apparent forethought, the Communists sent agitators down into a rural county of northern Alabama, and induced the wretched Negro sharecroppers to form a “Union.” The result was an immediate clash with the authorities; the Communist organizers ran away, and a half-dozen black men face a term in the penitentiary.\nIf the object of this maneuver was simply to stir up trouble, it succeeded, but at bitter expense to deluded Negroes. If its object was to organize the victims of the share crop system, in order to resist exploitation, and to lead to steps for betterment, then the whole thing was doomed to failure from the beginning because the white sharecroppers of that particular part of Alabama would rather starve than unite in an organization with Negroes. It may well be that this attitude on their part is the result of silly ignorance and instigated directly or indirectly by the land holders and capitalists. But whatever its cause may be, it is a fact, and to ignore such a fact is stupid and wrong."

Keeping his eye upon ideals, and measures which make for the uplift of mankind, and particulary for the establishment of a state ruled by the working classes for the benefit of all the workers, his object is so to use his vote as to accomplish any and all reforms leading toward the great goal, so long as he is able, simultaneously and in the same degree to break down color caste. No matter how fair the promises or programs of parties may be, Negroes will refuse to support them unless they can show an object compatible with the Negro’s survival and reasonable power to carry this out. He will tell both Socialists and Communists that their first job is to make the American working classes free from color prejudice. And that until they do this, the Negro refuses to give up his chance to make a living, in order to put bread and butter into the mouths of his enemies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVotes (1919)\nThe Negro in Politics (1929)\nThe Presidential Campaign (1916)\nThe Oath of the Negro Voter (1918)\nPolitical Straws (1923)"

    "text": "My Grandfather left a passage in his diary expressing his indignation at receiving an invitation to a “Negro” picnic. Alexander DuBois, born in the Bahamas, son of Dr. James DuBois of the well-known DuBois family of Poughkeepsie, N. Y., had been trained as a gentleman in the Cheshire School of Connecticut, and the implications of a Negro picnic were anathema to his fastidious soul. It meant close association with poverty, ignorance and suppressed and disadvantaged people, dirty and with bad manners.\nThis was in 1856. Seventy years later, Marcus Garvey discovered that a black skin was in itself a sort of patent to nobility, and that Negroes ought to be proud of themselves and their ancestors, for the same or analogous reasons that made white folk feel superior.\nThus, within the space of three-fourths of a century, the pendulum has swung between race pride and race suicide, between attempts to build up a racial ethos and attempts to escape from ourselves. In the years between emancipation and 1900, the theory of escape was dominant. We were, by birth, law and training, American citizens. We were going to escape into the mass of Americans in the same way that the Irish and Scandinavians and even the Italians were beginning to disappear. The process was going to be slower on account of the badge of color; but then, after all, it was not so much the matter of physical assimilation as of spiritual and psychic amalgamation with the American people.\nFor this reason, we must oppose all segregation and all racial patriotism; we must salute the American flag and sing “Our Country ’Tis of Thee” with devotion and fervor, and we must fight for our rights with long and carefully planned campaign; uniting for this purpose with all sympathetic people, colored and white.\nThis is still the dominant philosophy of most American Negroes and it is back of the objection to even using a special designation like “Negro” or even “Afro-American” or any such term.\nBut there are certain practical difficulties connected with this program which are becoming more and more clear today. First of all comes the fact that we are still ashamed of ourselves and are thus estopped from valid objection when white folks are ashamed to call us human. The reasons of course, are not as emphatic as they were in the case of my grandfather. I remember a colored man, now ex-patriate, who made this discovery in my company, some twenty-five years ago. He was a handsome burning brown, tall, straight and well-educated, and he occupied a position which he had won, across and in spite of the color line. He did not believe in Negroes, for himself or his family, and he planned elaborately to escape the trammels of race. Yet, he had responded to a call for a meeting of colored folk which touched his interests, and he came. He found men of his own caliber and training; he found men charming and companionable. He was thoroughly delighted. I know that never before, or I doubt if ever since, he had been in such congenial company. He could not help mentioning his joy continually and reiterating it.\nAll colored folk had gone through the same experience, for more and more largely in the last twenty-five years, colored America has discovered itself; has discovered groups of people, association with whom is a poignant joy and despite their ideal of American assimilation, in more and more cases and with more and more determined object they seek each other.\nThat involves, however, a drawing of class lines inside the Negro race, and it means the emergence of a certain social aristocracy, who by reasons of looks and income, education and contact, form the sort of upper social group which the world has long known and helped to manufacture and preserve. The early basis of this Negro group was simply color and a bald imitation of the white environment. Later, it tended, more and more, to be based on wealth and still more recently on education and social position.\nThis leaves a mass of untrained and uncultured colored folk and even of trained but ill-mannered people and groups of impoverished workers of whom this upper class of colored Americans are ashamed. They are ashamed both directly and indirectly, just as any richer or better sustained group in a nation is ashamed of those less fortunate and withdraws its skirts from touching them. But more than that, because the upper colored group is desperately afraid of being represented before American whites by this lower group, or being mistaken for them, or being treated as though they were part of it, they are pushed to the extreme of effort to avoid contact with the poorest classes of Negroes. This exaggerates, at once, the secret shame of being identified with such people and the anomaly of insisting that the physical characteristics of these folk which the upper-class shares, are not the stigmata of degradation.\nWhen, therefore, in offense or defense, the leading group of Negroes must make common cause with the masses of their own race, the embarrassment or hesitation becomes apparent. They are embarrassed and indignant because an educated man should be treated as a Negro, and that no Negroes receive credit for social standing. They are ashamed and embarrassed because of the compulsion of being classed with a mass of people over whom they have no real control and whose action they can influence only with difficulty and compromise and with every risk of defeat.\nEspecially is all natural control over this group difficult—I mean control of law and police, of economic power, of guiding standards and ideals, of news propaganda. On this comes even greater difficulty because of the incompatibility of any action which looks toward racial integrity and race action with previous ideals. What are we really aiming at? The building of a new nation or the integration of a new group into an old nation? The latter has long been our ideal. Must it be changed? Should it be changed? If we seek new group loyalty, new pride of race, new racial integrity—how, where, and by what method shall these things be attained? A new plan must be built up. It cannot be the mere rhodomontade and fatuous propaganda on which Garveyism was based. It has got to be far-sighted planning. It will involve increased segregation and perhaps migration. It will be pounced upon and aided and encouraged by every “niggerhater” in the land.\nMoreover, in further comment on all this, it may be pointed out that this is not the day for the experiment of new nations or the emphasis of racial lines. This is, or at least we thought it was, the day of the Inter-nation, of Humanity, and the disappearance of “race” from our vocabulary. Are we American Negroes seeking to move against, or into the face of this fine philosophy? Here then is the real problem, the real new dilemma between rights of American citizens and racial pride, which faces American Negroes today and which is not always or often clearly faced,\nThe situation is this: America, in denying equality of rights, of employment and social recognition to American Negroes, has said in the past that the Negro was so far below the average nation in social position, that he could not be recognized until he had developed further. In the answer to this, the Negro has eliminated five-sixths of his illiteracy according to official figures, and greatly increased the number of colored persons who have received education of the higher sort. They still are poor with a large number of delinquents and dependents. Nevertheless, their average situation in this respect has been greatly improved and, on the other hand, the emergence and accomplishment of colored men of ability has been undoubted. Notwithstanding this, the Negro is still a group apart, with almost no social recognition, subject to insult and discrimination, with income and wage far below the average of the nation and the most deliberately exploited industrial class in America. Even trained Negroes have increasing difficulty in making a living sufficient to sustain a civilized standard of life. Particularly in the recent vast economic changes, color discrimination as it now goes on, is going to make it increasingly difficult for the Negro to remain an integral part of the industrial machine or to increase his participation in accordance with his ability.\nThe integration of industry is making it more and more possible for executives to exercise their judgment in choosing for key positions, persons who can guide the industrial machine, and the exclusion of persons from such positions merely on the basis of race and color or even Negro descent is a widely recognized and easily defended prerogative. All that is necessary for any Christian American gentleman of high position and wide power to say in denying place and promotion to an eligible candidate is: “He is of Negro descent.” The answer and excuse is final and all but universally accepted. For this reason, the Negro’s opportunity in State directed industry and his opportunity in the great private organization of industry if not actually growing less, is certainly much smaller than his growth in education and ability. Either the industry of the nation in the future is to be conducted by private trusts or by government control. There seems in both to be little or no chance of advancement for the Negro worker, the educated artisan and the educated leader.\nOn the other hand, organized labor is giving Negroes less recognition today than ever. It has practically excluded them from all the higher lines of skilled work, on railroads, in machine-shops, in manufacture and in the basic industries. In agriculture, where the Negro has theoretically the largest opportunity, he is excluded from successful participation, not only by conditions common to all farmers, but by special conditions due to lynching, lawlessness, disfranchisement and social degradation.\nFacing these indisputable facts, there is on the part of the leaders of public opinion in America, no effective response to our agitation or organized propaganda. Our advance in the last quarter century has been in segregated, racially integrated institutions and efforts and not in effective entrance into American national life. In Negro churches, Negro schools, Negro colleges, Negro business and Negro art and literature our advance has been determined and inspiring; but in industry, general professional careers and national life, we have fought battle after battle and lost more often than we have won. There seems no hope that America in our day will yield in its color or race hatred any substantial ground and we have no physical nor economic power, nor any alliance with other social or economic classes that will force compliance with decent civilized ideals in Church, State, industry or art.\nThe next step, then, is certainly one on the part of the Negro and it involves group action. It involves the organization of intelligent and earnest people of Negro descent for their preservation and advancement in America, in the West Indies and in Africa; and no sentimental distaste for racial or national unity can be allowed to hold them back from a step which sheer necessity demands.\nA new organized group action along economic lines, guided by intelligence and with the express object of making it possible for Negroes to earn a better living and, therefore, more effectively to support agencies for social uplift, is without the slightest doubt the next step. It will involve no opposition from white America because they do not believe we can accomplish it. They expect always to be able to crush, insult, ignore and exploit 12,000,000 individual Negroes without intelligent organized opposition. This organization is going to involve deliberate propaganda for race pride. That is, it is going to start out by convincing American Negroes that there is no reason for their being ashamed of themselves; that their record is one which should make them proud; that their history in Africa and the world is a history of effort, success and trial, comparable with that of any other people.\nSuch measured statements can, and will be exaggerated. There will he those who will want to say that the black race is the first and greatest of races, that its accomplishments are most extraordinary, that its desert is most obvious and its mistakes negligible. This is the kind of talk we hear from people with the superiority complex among the white and the yellow race.\nWe cannot entirely escape it, since it is just as true, and just as false as such statements among other races; but we can use intelligence in modifying and restraining it. We can refuse deliberately to lie about our history, while at the same time taking just pride in Nefertari, Askia, Moshesh, Toussaint and Frederick Douglass, and testing and encouraging belief in our own ability by organized economic and social action.\nThere is no other way; let us not be deceived. American Negroes will be beaten into submission and degradation if they merely wait unorganized to find some place voluntarily given them in the new reconstruction of the economic world. They must themselves force their race into the new economic set-up and bring with them the millions of West Indians and Africans by peaceful organization for normative action or else drift into greater poverty, greater crime, greater helplessness until there is no resort but the last red alternative of revolt, revenge and war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAgain, Social Equality (1920)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nWilliam Monroe Trotter (1914)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\nOptimism (1929)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “On Being Ashamed of Oneself.”\nThe Crisis 40 (9): 199–200. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/09/on_being_ashamed.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was the great Jew, Benjamin Disraeli, who said: “Youth is a blunder; manhood a struggle; old age a regret.” And so with blunder and regret and perhaps something of struggle, we came together last month in the second Amenia Conference.\nThe first conference at Joel Spingarn’s beautiful country estate, took place in 1916. And after its few days of frank fellowship there was no adequate reason left for essential differences of opinion between the followers of Booker T. Washington, then just dead, and those younger men who had so vigorously opposed some of his policies.\nThe second Amenia conference held at Troutbeck, seventeen years later, had a definite object,—one much more usual in this world, and yet emphasized today both within and without the Negro race because of World War and unemployment. It was an attempt to bring together and into sympathetic understanding, Youth and Age interested in the Negro problem. And more particularly Youth, with a fringe of Age; and not extreme youth. Eliminating four admittedly among the elders, the others ranged in age between twenty-five and thirty-five, with a median age of thirty, that is, they were well out of college and started on their life work, and yet, as the invitations suggested, they were still with inquiring minds and still unsettled as to their main life work.\nThese younger conferees may be classed in various ways:\nThere were 5 social workers; 5 college professors, 4 Y.W.C.A. workers, 3 teachers, 3 lawyers, 2 artisans, 2 librarians, a physician, a student and a Y.M.C.A. worker.\nRepresenting age (more or less willingly), were 2 editors, a professor and a social worker. All were college graduates except one. There were two Doctors of Philosophy.\nAmong the visitors were a distinguished author, a Federal official, a social worker and a physician.\nThis, of course, was far from being a cross-section of the group represented. Those present were picked almost haphazard from a list of over 400 names sent to us from all parts of the country. The younger people were, however, very interesting. Among them 3 gave evidence of first-class scholarship, based on thoughtful study and reading; ten were clear-thinkers, able to state their thoughts succinctly and definitely, not at all settled in thought or opinion and frankly aware of the fact, and yet able to contribute to thought. Four were more emotional, not altogether clear in thought, but evidently in earnest and groping. Two were bright but cynical, and the rest were a miscellaneous group, some of whom lacked training and others were merely silent.\nOn the whole, they were inspiring. They had evidently been thinking and they had not stopped the process. Their difficulty was mainly the difficulty of all youth. Inspired and swept on by its vision, it does not know or rightly interpret the past and is apt to be too hurried carefully to study the present. For instance, one earnest young man told of the need of a Negro lobby in Washington and how certain persons were going to start one. The officials of the N.A.A.C.P. promptly told of the lobby which had been sustained there for five or more years; and the real solution of this apparent contradiction was: How efficient was the former lobby? Why was it not continued? And how far was the present proposal learning from the mistakes and successes of the first venture?\nOnly by such linking of past, present and future can real national and group advance be made, and this, I think, the Amenia conference was conscious of before it adjourned.\nOf course, the difficulty with age and youth is to find a common language; an attitude in which they can approach each other. It is hard for age to admit or understand that it has not thought of everything or attempted everything, or done what it has done as efficiently as it might have done. It is equally difficult for youth to know that age has thought of some of the various problems which bother youth; has tried and failed and succeeded and for reasons not explained altogether by either stupidity or cowardice. In attitude, youth with its tongue in its cheek assumes very often a silent reverence for age which it does not in the slightest feel. And age recognizes the mockery, and on the other hand, it is exceedingly difficult for age not to patronize youth, and to say by silences and inflections: “You really know very little.” Which is of course true but applies but little more to youth than to age.\nWe talked from Friday to Monday, interspersed with swimming and glorious food. Our general thesis was:\n\nIn view of the present world depression and the race problems which have exhibited themselves in Germany, India and Africa, the West Indies and the United States, what should be the ultimate goal of a young, educated American Negro with regard to:\nA. Occupation and Income\nB. Racial Organization\nC. Inter-Racial Co-operation\n\nAs a matter of fact most of the discussion confined itself to the economic conditions and the influence of education and politics on these conditions, There was little time left for the matter of racial organization, while the interracial aspects of the problem received practically no attention.\nThe discussion was interesting. There was not a single speech made; that is, there was no attempt at rounded periods and eloquence by persons who had nothing in particular to say. No one even attempted it. When anyone got the floor, they really took hold of the thought and did something with it. And in the end, the general consensus of agreement was rather startling. Far greater than most of us had thought. These were the resolutions:\nThis conference was called to make a critical appraisal of the Negro’s existing situation in American Society and to consider underlying principles for future action. Such criticism at this stage does not involve the offering of concrete program for any organization for administrative guidance.\nThere has been no attempt to disparage the older type of leadership. We appreciate their importance and contributions but we feel that in a period in which economic, political, and social values are rapidly shifting, and the very structure of organized society is being revamped, the leadership which is necessary is that which will integrate the special problems of the Negro within the larger issues facing the nation.\nThe primary problem is economic. Individual ownership expressing itself through the control and exploitation of natural resources and industrial machinery has failed in the past to equalize consumption with production.\nAs a result of which the whole system of private property and private profit is being called into question. The government is being forced to attempt an economic reorganization based upon a “co-partnership” between capital, labor and government itself. The government is attempting to augment consumptive power by increasing wages, shortening hours and controlling the labor and commodity markets. As a consumer the Negro has always had a low purchasing power as a result of his low wages coming from his inferior and restricted position in the labor market. If the government program fails to make full and equal provision for the Negro, it cannot be effective in restoring economic stability.\nIn the past there has been a greater exploitation of Negro labor than of any other section of the working class, manifesting itself particularly in lower wages, longer hours, excessive use of child labor and a higher proportion of women at work. Heretofore there has been slight recognition by Negro labor or Negro leaders of the significance of this exploitation in the economic order. Consequently no technique or philosophy has been developed to change the historic status of Negro labor. Hence in the present governmental set-up there is grave danger that this historic status will be perpetuated. As a result the lower wages on the one hand will reduce the purchasing power of Negro labor and on the other be a constant threat to the standards and security of white labor.\nThe question then arises how far existing agencies working among and for Negroes are theoretically and structurally prepared to cope with this situation. It is the opinion of the conference that the welfare of white and black labor are one and inseparable and that the existing agencies working among and for Negroes have conspicuously failed in facing a necessary alignment between black and white labor.\nIt is impossible to make any permanent improvement in the status and the security of white labor without making an identical improvement in the status and the security of Negro labor.\nThe Negro worker must be made conscious of his relation to white labor and the white worker must be made conscious that the purposes of labor, immediate or ultimate cannot be achieved, without full participation by the Negro worker.\nThe traditional labor movement as based upon craft autonomy and separatism which is non-political in outlook and centering its attention upon the control of jobs and wages for the minority of skilled white workers is an ineffective agency for aligning white and black labor for the larger labor objectives.\nThese objectives can only be attained through a new labor movement. This movement must direct its immediate attention to the organizing of the great mass of workers both skilled and unskilled, white and black. Its activities must be political as well as economic for the purpose of effecting such social legislation as old age pensions, unemployment insurance, child and female labor, etc. These social reforms may go to the extent of change in the form of Government itself. The Conference sees three possibilities:\n\nFascism\nCommunism\nReformed Democracy.\n\nThe conference is opposed to Fascism because it would crystalize the Negro’s position at the bottom of the social structure. Communism is impossible without a fundamental transformation in the psychology and the attitude of white workers on the race question and a change in the Negro’s conception of himself as a worker. A democracy that is attempting to reform itself is a fact which has to be reckoned with. In the process of reform the interests of the Negro cannot be adequately safeguarded by white paternalism in government. It is absolutely indispensable that in this attempt of the government to control agriculture and industry, there be adequate Negro representations on all boards and fields staffs.\nWhile the accomplishment of these aims cannot be achieved except through the cooperation of white and black, the primary responsibility for the initiation development and execution of this program rests upon the Negro himself. This is predicated upon the increased economic independence of the Negro. No matter what artificial class difference may seem to exist within the Negro group it must be recognized that all elements of the Race must weld themselves together for the common welfare. This point of view must be indoctrinated through the churches, educational institutions and other agencies working in behalf of the Negro. The first steps toward the rapprochement between the educated Negro and the Negro mass must be taken by the educated Negro himself. The Finding Committee recommends that the practical implications of this program be referred to a committee on continuation to be appointed at this conference.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThere were some little sidelights that are of interest First and foremost, I discovered that these young people could not sing. It was astonishing. It would be impossible to get thirty young Germans, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Haitians or Chinese together, who could not and would not sing enthusiastically songs that they all knew. But we did not know any songs and we could not sing them. We could not even try. We were too sophisticated. We had heard Hayes and Marian Anderson, not to mention the Metropolitan Opera, and we were dumb in both senses of the word.\nIn addition to that there was on the part of a few a certain, not unexpected, but nevertheless startling lack of self-discipline. It has always been interesting to me to see how young people in many countries organized their government and discipline and enforce it with a certain ruthlessness. But here out of twenty-six, five did as they pleased with regard to noise, sleep and enjoyment with utter disregard of the perfectly evident desires of the rest, and to cap the climax, the rest uttered no protest. I have seen evidence of this sort of thing among young colored people elsewhere. It is for us and the race a new and pressing problem.\nPerhaps the second Amenia conference will not be as epoch-making as the first, but on the other hand, it is just as possible that it will be more significant for the future than any conference which colored people have yet held, That depends entirely upon what reactions follow this meeting.\nThis sketch of the conference cannot close without reference to the hospitality of the host, Joel E. Spingarn, and the thoughtful co-operation of his wife, his two daughters and his two sons. It was withal a very beautiful experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVictory (1917)\nThe New Crisis (1925)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nThe White Church (1917)\nThe Crisis (1910)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “Youth and Age at Amenia.”\nThe Crisis 40 (10): 226–27. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/10/youth_and_age.html."

And this, not on account of their color, which may be yellow, brown or black, but on account of their history and their social surroundings. They react as white Americans. They have all the racial prejudices of white America, not only against Asiatics and Jews, but even against Mexicans and West Indians. In all questions of human interest, they would flock to white America before they would flock to the brown West Indies or to black Africa or to yellow Asia.\nThis, of course, is quite natural, and in a sense proves how idiotic most of our racial distinctions are. Here is a boy, born in America, of parents who were born in America, of grandparents and great grandparents born in America. He speaks the American twang; he reads American history, he gets his news from American papers, and he understands American baseball. It is impossible for that boy to think of himself as African, simply because he happens to be black. He is an American. But on the other hand, as he grows up and comprehends his surroundings, he is going to be made to think of himself as at least a peculiar sort of American. Against this, he is going to protest, logically and emotionally, and dwell upon the anomaly of a person being outcast and discriminated against in his own home. Gradually, however, he is going to find that this protest has only limited effect; that to most white Americans of today, Negro prejudice is something that is beyond question and will. It is a stark, true fact and little or nothing can be done about it at present. In the future, the long future, things may change. But they are not going to change in the lifetime of those now living.\nSo long now as this is an academic question, a matter of attitudes and thoughts and spiritual likes and dislikes, we can leave it there. But when it becomes an economic problem, a stark matter of bread and butter, then if this young, black American is going to survive and live a life, he must calmly face the fact that however much he is an American there are interests which draw him nearer to the dark people outside of America than to his white fellow citizens.\nAnd those interests are the same matters of color caste, of discrimination, of exploitation for the sake of profit, of public insult and oppression, against which the colored peoples of Mexico, South America, the West Indies and all Africa, and every country in Asia, complain and have long been complaining. It is, therefore, simply a matter of ordinary common sense that these people should draw together in spiritual sympathy and intellectual co-operation, to see what can be done for the freedom of the human spirit which happens to be incased in dark skin.\nThis was the idea that was back of the Pan-African Congresses; started in Paris directly after the war, and carried on for several years. These Congresses brought upon themselves the active enmity and disparagement of all the colony-owning powers. Englishmen, Frenchmen, Belgians and others looked upon the movement as a political movement designed to foment disaffection and strife and to correct abuse by force.\nIt may be that in the end nothing but force will break down the injustice of the color line. But to us who have seen and known the futility of war, the ghastly paradox of talking about Victor and Vanquished in the last world holocaust, there is a feeling that we must desperately try methods of thought and co-operation and economic re-adjustment before we yield to councils of despair. And in this program, all that has been said about economic readjustment in America for American Negroes can be said with even more emphasis concerning the Negroes of the world and concerning the darker peoples. These people raise everything necessary to satisfy human wants. They are capable of carrying on every process by which material, transported and re-made, may satisfy the needs and appetites of men.\nThey are all of them willing and eager to work, and yet because their work is misdirected in order to make a profit for white people, these dark people must starve and be unemployed.\nHere in the United States the net result of the National Recovery Act so far has been to raise wages for a small number of favored white workers and to decrease wages or push out of employment entirely the Negro. It is possible that this present result may in time be changed, and we note with interest what Secretary Ickes has said to the State Engineers and Public Works Administration:\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that the Public Works Administration is for the benefit of all the people of the country. The established policy in the construction of public buildings and public works under its control is that in the employment of mechanics and labor, preference be given to local labor to the extent that it is available and competent, and that there be no discrimination exercised against any person because of color or religious affiliation.\n\nNevertheless, this we feel is going to make little difference so long as the American people believe that any white men of whatever character or education is better than any possible colored man.\nIt is, therefore, imperative that the colored peoples of the world, and first of all those of Negro descent, should begin to concentrate upon this problem of their economic survival, the best of their brains and education. Pan-Africa means intellectual understanding and co-operation among all groups of Negro descent in order to bring about at the earliest possible time the industrial and spiritual emancipation of the Negro peoples.\nSuch a movement must begin with a certain spiritual housecleaning. American Negroes, West Indians, West Africans and South Africans must proceed immediately to wipe from their minds the preconcepts of each other which they have gained through white newspapers. They must cease to think of Liberia and Haiti as failures in government; of American Negroes as being engaged principally in frequenting Harlem cabarets and Southern lynching parties; of West Indians as ineffective talkers; and of West Africans as parading around in breech-clouts.\nThese are the pictures of each other which white people have painted for us and which with engaging naiveté we accept, and then proceed to laugh at each other and criticize each other before we make any attempt to learn the truth. There are, for instance, in the United States today several commendable groups of young people who are proposing to take hold of Liberia and emancipate her from her difficulties, quite forgetting the fact that Liberia belongs to Liberia. They made it. They suffered and died for it. And they are not handing over their country to any group of young strangers who happen to be interested. If we want to help Liberia, our business is to see in what respect the Liberians need help, and the person best able to give this information are the Liberians themselves.\nIt is a large and intricate problem but the sooner we put ourselves in position to study it with a vast and increasing area of fact and with carefully guided and momentarily tested effort, the sooner we shall find ourselves citizens of the world and not its slaves and pensioners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nUnity (1924)\nCorrespondence (1926)\nA Statement (1919)\nThe Strength of Segregation (1913)\nThe Name Negro (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “Pan-Africa and New Racial\nPhilosophy.” The Crisis 40 (10): 247, 262. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/11/panafrica_and_new_racial_philosophy.html."

Being a minority group in numbers, resources, and power, the Negro has nothing to gain by violence, they hold, but, on the contrary, everything to lose, including his life. What is even more tragic, they point out, is the fact that violence inevitably brings suffering and peril to multitudes in no way responsible. They believe communist organizers are seeking to use the Negro merely as a fagot to light the fires of political revolution, and that Negroes should be too wise to let themselves be sacrificed.\n\nThis is a pitiful dodging of the issue. When in God’s name did American Negroes need to have non-resistance preached to them?\nThe point that the decent white South must face is: How long is the sheriff’s posse, recruited from the white mob, going to be permitted to be the willing and pliant tool of Southern Capital, Credit, Extortion and Graft? And how long are black men going to be shot in the back running for the “crime” of defending their own homes against legal thieves and marauders?\nWhat has this elementary matter of simple justice and decency to do with Communism or Methodism or the Integral Calculus? Why dodge and hide behind Russia every time a cowardly Southern mob kills a black man? I believe in Peace. I shudder at Revolution. But when in 1906 the Atlanta mob began killing Negroes wholesale, I went and bought a repeating shot-gun and loaded it with buckshot.

Both of us thank you, and wish for you long years of happiness.\n\nI am minded, therefore, to add: Do your friends all say. “Too bad it wasn’t a boy?” If they do, listen and reply:\nThe ancient idea that boys are intrinsically and naturally better than girls is a relic of barbarism that dies a hard death. We must, however, insist on reminding ourselves that the idea is uncivilized and pre-historic and rooted in a day when women were owned and men their owners by force or theft. Many things still remind us of that stage of culture: the loss of a woman’s name by her marriage; the persistent idea that a married woman should not have a career; and the older opposition to woman suffrage. In other words, the continued inferiority of women in work and wage and certain phases of social esteem is at the bottom of this supposed preference for boy children. And this is especially pronounced among primitive and ignorant people.\nOn the other hand there are certain distinct advantages in girls. They contribute to the home, in the first ten or fifteen fateful years, far more than boys. They become the intimate and loving part of its organism, its work and play and decoration. They are educated and trained in the home by parents and chosen guests, while the boy, despite every effort, gets his chief training on the streets and even in the gutter.

    "text": "Karl Marx was a Jew born at Treves, Germany, in March, 1818. He came of an educated family and studied at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin, planning first to become a lawyer, and then to teach philosophy.\nBut his ideas were too radical for the government. He turned to journalism, and finally gave his life to economic reform, dying in London in 1883, after having lived in Germany, Belgium, France, and, for the last thirty-five years of his life, in England. He published in 1867, the first volume of his monumental work, “Capital.”\nThere are certain books in the world which every searcher for truth must know: the Bible, the Critique of Pure Reason, the Origin of Species, and Karl Marx’ “Capital.”\nYet until the Russian Revolution, Karl Marx was little known in America. He was treated condescendingly in the universities, and regarded even by the intelligent public as a radical agitator whose curious and inconvenient theories it was easy to refute. Today, at last, we all know better, and we see in Karl Marx a colossal genius of infinite sacrifice and monumental industry, and with a mind of extraordinary logical keenness and grasp. We may disagree with many of the great books of truth that I have named, and with “Capital,” but they can never be ignored.\nAt a recent dinner to Einstein, another great Jew, the story was told of a professor who was criticized as having “no sense of humor” because he tried to explain the Theory of Relativity in a few simple words. Something of the same criticism must be attached to anyone who attempts similarly to indicate the relation of Marxian philosophy and the American Negro problem. And yet, with all modesty, I am essaying the task knowing that it will be but tentative and subject to much criticism, both on my own part and that of other abler students.\nThe task which Karl Marx set himself was to study and interpret the organization of industry in the modern world. One of Marx’s earlier works, “The Communist Manifesto,” issued in 1848, on the eve of the series of democratic revolutions in Europe, laid down this fundamental proposition.\n\nThat in every historical epoch the prevailing mode of economic production and exchange, and the social organization necessarily following from it, form the basis upon which is built up, and from which alone can be explained, the political and intellectual history of that epoch; that consequently the whole history of mankind. … has been a history of class struggles, contest between exploiting and exploited, ruling and oppressed classes; that the history of these class struggles forms a series of evolution in which, now-a-days, a stage has been reached where the exploited and oppressed class (the proletariat) cannot attain its emancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling class (the bourgeoisie) without, at the same time, and once and for all, emancipating society at large from all exploitation, oppression, class-distinction and class struggles.\n\nAll will notice in this manifesto, phrases which have been used so much lately and so carelessly that they have almost lost their meaning. But behind them still is living and insistent truth. The class struggle of exploiter and exploited is a reality. The capitalist still today owns machines, materials, and wages with which to buy labor. The laborer even in America owns little more than his ability to work. A wage contract takes place between these two and the resultant manufactured commodity or service is the property of the capitalist.\nHere Marx begins his scientific analysis based on a mastery of practically all economic theory before his time and on an extraordinary, thoroughgoing personal knowledge of industrial conditions over all Europe and many other parts of the world.\nHis final conclusions were never all properly published. He lived only to finish the first volume of his “Capital,” and the other two volumes were completed from his papers and notes by his friend Engels. The result is an unfinished work, extraordinarily difficult to read and understand and one which the master himself would have been first to criticize as not properly representing his mature and finished thought.\nNevertheless, that first volume, together with the fairly evident meaning of the others, lay down a logical line of thought. The gist of that philosophy is that the value of products regularly exchanged in the open market depends upon the labor necessary to produce them; that capital consists of machines, materials and wages paid for labor; that out of the finished product, when materials have been paid for and the wear and tear and machinery replaced, and wages paid, there remains a surplus value. This surplus value arises from labor and is the difference between what is actually paid laborers for their wages and the market value of the commodities which the laborers produce. It represents, therefore, exploitation of the laborer, and this exploitation, inherent in the capitalistic system of production, is the cause of poverty, of industrial crises, and eventually of social revolution.\nThis social revolution, whether we regard it as voluntary revolt or the inevitable working of a vast cosmic law of social evolution, will be the last manifestation of the class struggle, and will come by inevitable change induced by the very nature of the conditions under which present production is carried on, It will come by the action of the great majority of men who compose the wage-earning proletariat, and it will result in common ownership of all capital, the disappearance of capitalistic exploitation, and the division of the products and services of industry according to human needs, and not according to the will of the owners of capital.\nIt goes without saying that every step of this reasoning and every presentation of supporting facts have been bitterly assailed. The labor theory of value has been denied; the theory of surplus value refuted; and inevitability of revolution scoffed at; while industrial crises—at least until this present one—have been defended as unusual exceptions proving the rule of modern industrial efficiency.\nBut with the Russian experiment and the World Depression most thoughtful men today are beginning to admit:\nThat the continued recurrence of industrial crises and wars based largely on economic rivalry, with persistent poverty, unemployment, disease and crime, are forcing the world to contemplate the possibilities of fundamental change in our economic methods; and that means thorough-going change, whether it be violent, as in France or Russia, or peaceful, as seems just as possible, and just as true to the Marxian formula, if it is fundamental change; in any case, Revolution seems bound to come.\nPerhaps nothing illustrates this better than recent actions in the United States: our re-examination of the whole concept of Property; our banking moratorium; the extraordinary new agriculture bill; the plans to attack unemployment, and similar measures. Labor rather than gambling is the sure foundation of value and whatever we call it—exploitation, theft or business acumen—there is something radically wrong with an industrial system that turns out simultaneously paupers and millionaires and sets a world starving because it has too much food.\nWhat now has all this to do with the Negro problem? First of all, it is manifest that the mass of Negroes in the United States belong distinctly to the working proletariat. Of every thousand working Negroes less than a hundred and fifty belong to any class that could possibly be considered bourgeois. And even this more educated and prosperous class has but small connection with the exploiters of wage and labor. Nevertheless, this black proletariat is not a part of the white proletariat. Black and white work together in many cases, and influence each other’s rates of wages. They have similar complaints against capitalists, save that the grievances of the Negro worker are more fundamental and indefensible, ranging as they do, since-the day of Karl Marx, from chattel slavery, to the worst paid, sweated, mobbed and cheated labor in any civilized land.\nAnd while Negro labor in America suffers because of the fundamental inequities of the whole capitalistic system, the lowest and most fatal degree of its suffering comes not from the capitalists but from fellow white laborers. It is white labor that deprives the Negro of his right to vote, denies him education, denies him affiliation with trade unions, expels him from decent houses and neighborhoods, and heaps upon him the public insults of open color discrimination.\nIt is no sufficient answer to say that capital encourages this oppression and uses it for its own ends. This may have excused the ignorant and superstitious Russian peasants in the past and some of the poor whites of the South today. But the bulk of American white labor is neither ignorant nor fanatical. It knows exactly what it is doing and it means to do it. William Green and Mathew Woll of the A. F. of L. have no excuse of illiteracy or religion to veil their deliberate intention to keep Negroes and Mexicans and other elements of common labor, in a lower proletariat as subservient to their interests as theirs are to the interests of capital.\nThis large development of a petty bourgeoisie within the American laboring class is a post-Marxian phenomenon and the result of the tremendous and world wide development of capitalism in the 20th Century. The market of capitalistic production has gained an effective world-wide organization. Industrial technique and mass production have brought possibilities in the production of goods and services which out-run even this wide market. A new class of technical engineers and managers has arisen forming a working class aristocracy between the older proletariat and the absentee owners of capital. The real owners of capital are small as well as large investors—workers who have deposits in savings banks and small holdings in stocks and bonds; families buying homes and purchasing commodities on installment; as well as the large and rich investors.\nOf course, the individual laborer gets but an infinitesimal part of his income from such investments. On the other hand, such investments, in the aggregate, largely increase available capital for the exploiters, and they give investing laborers the capitalistic ideology. Between workers and owners of capital stand today the bankers and financiers who distribute capital and direct the engineers.\nThus the engineers and the saving better-paid workers, form a new petty bourgeois class, whose interests are bound up with those of the capitalists and antagonistic to those of common labor. On the other hand, common labor in America and white Europe far from being motivated by any vision of revolt against capitalism, has been blinded by the American vision of the possibility of layer after layer of the workers escaping into the wealthy class and becoming managers and employers of labor.\nThus in America we have seen a wild and ruthless scramble of labor groups over each other in order to climb to wealth on the backs of black labor and foreign immigrants. The Irish climbed on the Negroes. The Germans scrambled over the Negroes and emulated the Irish. The Scandinavians fought forward next to the Germans and the Italians and “Bohunks” are crowding up, leaving Negroes still at the bottom chained to helplessness, first by slavery, then by disfranchisement and always by the Color Bar.\nThe second influence on white labor both in America and Europe has been the fact that the extension of the world market by imperial expanding industry has established a world-wide new proletariat of colored workers, toiling under the worst conditions of 19th century capitalism, herded as slaves and serfs and furnishing by the lowest paid wage in modern history a mass of raw material for industry. With this largess the capitalists have consolidated their economic power, nullified universal suffrage and bribed the white workers by high wages, visions of wealth and the opportunity to drive “niggers.” Soldiers and sailors from the white workers are used to keep “darkies” in their “places” and white foremen and engineers have been established as irresponsible satraps in China and India, Africa and the West Indies, backed by the organized and centralized ownership of machines, raw materials, finished commodities and land monopoly over the whole world.\nHow now does the philosophy of Karl Marx apply today to colored labor? First of all colored labor has no common ground with white labor. No soviet of technocrats would do more than exploit colored labor in order to raise the status of whites. No revolt of a white proletariat could be started if its object was to make black workers their economic, political and social equals. It is for this reason that American socialism for fifty years has been dumb on the Negro problem, and the communists cannot even get a respectful hearing in America unless they begin by expelling Negroes.\nOn the other hand, within the Negro groups, in the United States, in West Africa, in South America and in the West Indies, petty bourgeois groups are being evolved. In South America and the West Indies such groups drain off skill and intelligence into the white group, and leave the black labor poor, ignorant and leaderless save for an occasional demagog.\nIn West Africa, a Negro bourgeoisie is developing with invested capital and employment of natives and is only kept from the conventional capitalistic development by the opposition and enmity of white capital, and the white managers and engineers who represent it locally and who display bitter prejudice and tyranny; and by white European labor which furnishes armies and navies and Empire “preference.” African black labor and black capital are therefore driven to seek alliance and common ground.\nIn the United States also a petty bourgeoisie is being developed, consisting of clergymen, teachers, farm owners, professional men and retail business men. The position of this class, however, is peculiar: they are not the chief or even large investors in Negro labor and therefore exploit it only here and there; and they bear the brunt of color prejudice because they express in word and work the aspirations of all black folk for emancipation. The revolt of any black proletariat could not, therefore, be logically directed against this class, nor could this class join either white capital, white engineers or white workers to strengthen the color bar.\nUnder these circumstances, what shall we say of the Marxian philosophy and of its relation to the American Negro? We can only say, as it seems to me, that the Marxian philosophy is a true diagnosis of the situation in Europe in the middle of the 19th Century despite some of its logical difficulties. But it must be modified in the United States of America and especially so far as the Negro group is concerned. The Negro is exploited to a degree that means poverty, crime, delinquency and indigence. And that exploitation comes not from a black capitalistic class but from the white capitalists and equally from the white proletariat. His only defense is such internal organization as will protect him from both parties, and such practical economic insight as will prevent inside the race group any large development of capitalistic exploitation.\nMeantime, comes the Great Depression. It levels all in mighty catastrophe. The fantastic industrial structure of America is threatened with ruin. The trade unions of skilled labor are double-tongued and helpless. Unskilled and common white labor is too frightened at Negro competition to attempt united action. It only begs a dole. The reformist program of Socialism meets no response from the white proletariat because it offers no escape to wealth and no effective bar to black labor, and a mud-sill of black labor is essential to white labor’s standard of living. The shrill cry of a few communists is not even listened to, because and solely because it seeks to break down barriers between black and white. There is not at present the slightest indication that a Marxian revolution based on a united class-conscious proletariat is anywhere on the American far horizon. Rather race antagonism and labor group rivalry is still undisturbed by world catastrophe. In the hearts of black laborers alone, therefore, lie those ideals of democracy in politics and industry which may in time make the workers of the world effective dictators of civilization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nKarl Marx and the Negro (1933)\nThe Negro and Radical Thought (1921)\nThe Negro and Communism (1931)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nMarcus Garvey and the NAACP (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “Marxism and The Negro Problem.”\nThe Crisis 40 (5): 103–4, 118. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/05/marxism_and_the_negro_problem.html."

    "text": "Without doubt the greatest figure in the science of modern industry is Karl Marx. He has been a center of violent controversy for three-quarters of a century, and for that reason there are some people who are so afraid of his doctrines that they dare not study the man and his work. This attitude is impossible, and particularly today when the world is so largely turning toward the Marxian philosophy, it is necessary to understand the man and his thought. This little article seeks merely to bring before American Negroes the fact that Karl Marx knew and sympathized with their problem.\nHeinrich Karl Marx was a German Jew, born in 1818 and died in 1883. His adult life, therefore, reached from the panic of 1837 through the administration of President Hayes. The thing about him which must be emphasized now was his encyclopedic knowledge. No modern student of industry probably ever equalled his almost unlimited reading and study.\nHe knew something about American Negroes from his German comrades who migrated to the United States; but these emigrants were of little help so far as his final conclusions were concerned. Kriege, a German radical, who came to the United States, said frankly in 1846, that “We feel constrained to oppose abolition with all our might.” Weitling, a Communist, paid scant attention to the slavery question. The German Labor Convention at Philadelphia in 1850 was dumb on slavery. Even Weidemeyer, Marx’s personal friend, said nothing about slavery in his Workingmen’s League, which was founded in 1853, although the next year he opposed the Kansas-Nebraska Bill. When the League was re-organized in 1857, it still said nothing about slavery, and a powerful branch of the League which seceded in 1857 advocated wide-spread serfdom of blacks and Chinese.\nThen came the war and Marx began to give the situation attention.\n\nThe present struggle between the South and the North,” he wrote in 1861, “is … nothing but a struggle between two social systems, the system of slavery and the system of free labor. Because the two systems can no longer live peaceably side by side on the North American continent, the struggle has broken out.”\n\nHe was well acquainted with those splendid leaders of the English workers who kept England from recognizing the South and perhaps entering the Civil War, who employed Frederick Douglass to arouse anti-slavery sentiment, and who organized those monster mass meetings in London and Manchester late in 1862 and early in 1863. It is possible that Marx had some hand in framing the addresses sent to President Lincoln in which they congratulated the Republic and found nothing to condemn except “The Slavery and degradation of men guilty only of a colored skin or African parentage.” The Manchester address congratulated the President on liberating the slaves in the District of Columbia, putting down the slave trade, and recognizing the Republics of Haiti and Liberia, and concluded that “You cannot now stop short of a complete up-rooting of slavery.”\nIt was after this, in September, 1864, that the International Workingmen’s Association was formed in which Marx was a leading spirit, and his was the pen that wrote the address to Abraham Lincoln in November, 1864.\n\nTo Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America.\n\nSir: —We congratulate the American peoople upon your re-election by a large majority. If resistance to the Slave Power was the watchword of your first election, the triumphal war-cry of your re-election is Death to Slavery.\n\nFrom the commencement of the titanic American strife the workingmen of Europe felt distinctively that the Star Spangled Banner carried the destiny of their class. The contest for the territories which opened the dire epopée, was it not to decide whether the virgin soil of immense tracts should be wedded to the labor of the immigrant or be prostituted by the tramp of the slave-driver?\n\nWhen an oligarchy of 300,000 slaveholders dared to inscribe for the first time in the annals of the world ‘Slavery’ on the banner of armed revolt, when on the very spots where hardly a century ago the idea of one great Democratic Republic had first sprung up, whence the first declaration of the Rights of Man was issued, and the first impulse given to the European Revolution of the eighteenth century, when on those very spots counter-revolution, with systematic thoroughness, gloried in rescinding ‘the ideas entertained at the time of the formation of the old constitution’ and maintained ‘slavery to be a beneficial institution.’ Indeed, the only solution of the great problem of the ‘relation of capital to labor,’ and cynically proclaimed property in man ‘the cornerstone of the new edifice,’—then the working classes of Europe understood at once, even before the fanatic partisanship of the upper classes, for the Confederate gentry had given its dismal warning, that the slaveholders’ rebellion was to sound the tocsin for a general holy war of property against labor, and that for the men of labor, with their hopes for the future, even their past conquests were at stake in that tremendous conflict on the other side of the Atlantic. Everywhere they bore therefore patiently the hardships imposed upon them by the cotton crisis, opposed enthusiastically the pro-slavery intervention-importunities of their betters—and from most parts of Europe contributed their quota of blood to the good of the cause.\n\nWhile the workingmen, the true political power of the North, allowed slavery to defile their own republic, while before the Negro, mastered and sold without his concurrence, they boasted it the highest prerogative of the white-skinned laborer to sell himself and choose his own master, they were unable to attain the true freedom of labor, or to sup- port their European brethren in their struggle for emancipation; but this barrier to progress has been swept off by the red sen of civil war.\n\nThe workingmen of Europe felt sure that, as the American War of Independence initiated a new era of ascendency for the middle class, so the American Anti-slavery War will do for the working classes. They consider it an earnest sign of the epoch to come that it fell to the lot of Abraham Lincoln, the single-minded ion of the working class, to lead his country through the matchless struggle for the rescue of the enchained race and the reconstruction of a social world.\n\nTo this the American Ambassador to London replied sympathetically. After Lincoln’s assassination, Marx again drafted a letter, May 13, 1865, in behalf of the International Association.\n\nThe demon of the ‘peculiar institution,’ for whose preservation the South rose in arms, did not permit its devotees to suffer honorable defeat on the open battlefield. What had been conceived in treason, must necessarily end in infamy. As Philip II’s war in behalf of the Inquisition produced a Girard, so Jef- ferson Davis’s rebellion a Booth. …\n\nAfter a gigantic Civil War which, if we consider its colossal extension and its vast scene of action, seems in comparison with the Hundred Years’ War and the Thirty Years’ War and the Twenty-three Years’ War of the Old World scarcely to have lasted ninety days, the task. Sir, devolves upon you to uproot by law what the sword has felled, and to preside over the more difficult work of political reconstruction and social regeneration. The profound consciousness of your great mission will preserve you from all weakness in the execution of your stern duties. You will never forget that the American people at the inauguration of the new era of the emancipation of labor placed the burden of leadership on the shoulders of two men of labor—Abraham Lincoln the one, and the other Andrew Johnson.\n\nAfter the war had closed, in September, 1865, still another letter went to the people of the United States from the same source.\n\nAgain we felicitate you upon the removal of the cause of these years of affliction—upon the abolition of slavery. This stain upon your otherwise, so shining escutcheon is forever wiped out. Never again shall the hammer of the auctioneer announce in your market-places sales of human flesh and blood and make mankind shudder at the cruel barbarism.\n\nYour noblest blood was shed in washing away these stains, and desolation has spread its black shroud over your country in penance for the past.\n\nToday you are free, purified through your sufferings. A brighter future is dawning upon your republic, proclaiming to the old world that a government of the people and by the people is a government for the people and not for a privileged minority.\n\nWe had the honor to express to you our sympathy in your affliction, to send you a word of encouragement in your struggles, and to congratulate you upon your success. Permit us to add a word of counsel for the future.\n\nInjustice against a fraction of your people having been followed by such dire consequences, put an end to it. Declare your fellow citizens from this day forth free and equal, without any reserve. If you refuse them citizens’ rights while you exact from them citizens’ duties, you will sooner or later face a new struggle which will once more drench your country in blood.\n\nThe eyes of Europe and of the whole world are on your attempts at reconstruction, and foes are ever ready to sound the death-knell of republican institutions as soon as they see their opportunity.\n\nWe therefore admonish you, as brothers in a common cause, to sunder all the chains of freedom, and your own victory will be complete.\n\nIn June of that year, a few months after Johnson had become President, Marx, writing to Engels, senses the beginnings of reaction:\n\nI naturally see what is repulsive in the form of the Yankee movement, hut I find the reason for it in the nature of a bourgeois democracy … where swindle has been on the sovereign throne for so long. Nevertheless, the events are world-upheaving …\n\nNaturally, Marx stood with the Abolitionist democracy, led by Sumner and Stevens.\n\nMr. Wade declared in public meetings that after the abolition of slavery, a radical change in the relation of capital and of property in land is next upon the order of the day.\n\nHe was suspicious of Johnson and wrote Engels in 1865:\n\nJohnson’s policy disturbs me. Ridiculous affectation of severity against individual persons; up to now highly vacillating and weak in the thing itself. The reaction has already begun in America and will soon be strengthened if this spinelessness is not put an end to.\n\nAnd finally, in 1877, after the Negroes had been betrayed by the Northern industrial obligarchy, he wrote:\n\nThe policy of the new president (Hayes) will make the Negroes, and the great exploitation of land in favor of the railways, mining companies, etc. … will make the already dissatisfied farmers, into allies of the working class.\n\nIt was a great loss to American Negroes that the great mind of Marx and his extraordinary insight into industrial conditions could not have been brought to bear at first hand upon the history of the American Negro between 1876 and the World War. Whatever he said and did concerning the uplift of the working class must, therefore, be modified so far as Negroes are concerned by the fact that he had not studied at first hand their peculiar race problem here in America. Nevertheless, He did know the plight of the working class in England, France and Germany, and American Negroes must understand what his panacea was for those folk if they would see their way clearly in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMarxism and The Negro Problem (1933)\nThe Negro and Radical Thought (1921)\nEugene Debs (1926)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nDives, Mob, and Scab (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “Karl Marx and the Negro.”\nThe Crisis 40 (3): 55–56. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/03/karl_marx_and_the_negro.html."

This has been supplemented by the startling information on the part of southern whites that they are the “best friends of the colored people,” etc.\nWe might as well face the facts squarely: If there is any colored man in the South who wishes to have his children educated and who wishes to be in close touch with civilization and who has any chance or ghost of a chance of making a living in the North it is his business to get out of the South as soon as possible. He need not seek for reasons for so doing. The same reasons that drive the Jew from Russia, the peasants from Austria, the Armenians from Turkey and the oppressed from tyranny everywhere should drive the colored man out of the land of lynching, lawlessness and industrial oppression.\nIt would, of course, be foolish for a man to give up a good chance of making a living and migrate to a country where he had little or no chance. But we are speaking of the case where men have an opportunity. These opportunities at present are widening in the North. Every single colored man who can should take advantage of it. The only effective protest that the Negroes en masse can make against lynching and dis­franchisement is through leaving the devilish country where these things take place.\nThe colored people of the North on the other hand, should welcome their escaping fellows. It means, undoubtedly, increased hardships for them; it will be proscription and temporary difficulties, but anything that means freedom to black slaves should be welcomed by their free northern brothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Migration (1917)\nSeparation (1911)\nLight (1912)\nPan-Africa and New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nBlessed Discrimination (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Migration.” The Crisis 12\n(6): 270. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/12/06/migration.html."

Jones became the first colored Episcopal priest in America and Allen founded the African Methodist Episcopal church. It was not, however, until a generation later that there were enough churches and conferences to call a General Conference of this church. It is fitting that its Centennial Conference should be celebrated in some striking manner and the General Conference Committee has asked the Horizon Guild to present again the Pageant, the “Star of Ethiopia.”\nThis pageant has been given in New York and in Washington with striking success. It is planned to make it even more successful in Philadelphia.

At a recent dinner given to the oldest woman doctor in the United States, Dr. Anna Manning Comfort told of the indignities which she suffered at Bellevue Hospital in 1865 for the unforgivable crime of being female:\n\nWe had to go to Bellevue Hospital for our practical work, and the indignities we were made to suffer are beyond belief. There were five hundred young men students taking post-graduate courses, and we were jeered at and catcalled, and the ‘old war horses,’ the doctors, joined the younger men.\n\nWe were considered aggressive. They said women did not have the same brains as men and were not trustworthy. All the work at the hospital was made as repulsively unpleasant for us as possible. There were originally six in the class, but all but two were unable to put up with the treatment to which we were subjected and dropped out. I trembled whenever I went to the hospital, and I said once that I could not bear it. Finally the women went to the authorities, who said that if we were not respectfully treated they would take the charter from the hospital.\n\nAs a physician there was nothing that I could do that satisfied people. If I wore square-toed shoes and swung my arms they said I was mannish, and if I carried a parasol and wore a ribbon in my hair they said I was too feminine. If I smiled they said I had too much levity, and if I sighed they said I had no sand.\n\nThey tore down my sign when I began to practice; the drug stores did not like to fill my prescriptions, and the older doctors would not consult with me. But that little band of women made it possible for the other women who have come later into the field to do their work. When my first patients came and saw me they said I was too young, and they asked in horrified tones if I had studied dissecting just like the men. They were shocked at that, but they were more shocked when my bills were sent in to find that I charged as much as a man.\n\nRemember this is the story of the treatment of a white woman by chivalrous American white men, the same men who tremble with indignation lest a black man look at one of these beautiful creatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSocial Equals (1927)\nBooze (1928)\nThe Tuskegee Hospital (1923)\nAgain, Social Equality (1920)\nGirls (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Consolation.” The Crisis 12\n(2): 169–73. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/12/02/consolations.html."

Movements toward furnishing model tenements for colored people are on foot in New York, Chicago and other cities. They are on their face in every way commendable. For the most part colored people in large cities have been compelled to put up with the old fashioned, inconvenient dwellings which white tenants no longer wanted, or they have gotten hold of better class houses only by the payment of exorbitant rents. The experiments of the Suburban Homes Company in New York City show conclusively that an excellent class of colored tenants may be had and good accommodations furnished at a fair rental. This effort should be extended; but when we find taking part in such philanthropic efforts the identical real estate interests in New York which have been working for years to oust colored people from the decent parts of Harlem and establish them upon the mud flats of the river in the extreme northeast, we have a right to view the matter with suspicion. The crucial question is, in New York and Chicago, WHERE are these proposed new tenements to be? Are they to be in a segregated district, or are they to be where there is light, air, transportation and decent surroundings? One great victory for anti-segregation democracy has been the buying of a site for the New York colored branch of the Y.M.C.A. outside of the proposed segregated dead line.\nWe would be very glad if the Urban League and the Harlem Property Owners’ Improvement Corporation would let the public know where their proposed new tenements in New York are to be erected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHomes (1912)\nReal Estate in New York (1914)\nBaltimore (1910)\nHyde Park (1920)\nAn Old Folks’ Home (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Tenements.” The Crisis 12\n(2): 81. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/12/02/tenements.html."

We have read of attacks by gas, of raids on non-fortified towns, of Zeppelins dropping bombs on women and children, and the whole campaign of “frightfulness” which left us at first cold and faint and even yet inspires in us a Sick distaste. What good can come out of it all? Much is still on the knees of the gods; but it takes no prophet to presage the advent of many things—notably the greater emancipation of European women, the downfall of monarchies, the gradual but certain dissolution of caste and the advance of a true Socialism. All this and much more. But for the immediate present and especially for us there is coming a gradual and subtle encouragement to strengthen race predilections and revel in them unashamed.\nThe civilization by which America insists on measuring us and to which we must conform our natural tastes and inclinations is the daughter of that European civilization which is now rushing furiously to its doom. This civilization with its aeroplanes and submarines, its wireless and its “big business” is no more static than that of those other civilizations in the rarest days of Greece and Rome. Behind all this gloss of culture and wealth and religion has been lurking the world-old lust for bloodshed and power gained at the cost of honor.\nThe realization of all this means for us the reassembling of old ideals. Honor which has had no meaning for us in this land of inconstant laws, takes on a new aspect; mediocrity, so long as it does not mean degradation, is sweet; peace—not “at any price,”—is a precious boon; old standards of beauty beckon us again, not the blue-eyed, white-skinned types which are set before us in school and literature but rich, brown and black men and women with glowing dark eyes and crinkling hair. Music has always been ours; but with the disappearance of those effete ideals comes the assurance that the plantation song is more in unison with the “harmony of the spheres” than Wagner’s greatest triumph. Life, which in this cold Occident stretched in bleak, conventional lines before us, takes on a warm, golden hue that harks back to the heritage of Africa and the tropics.\nBrothers, the war has shown us the cruelty of the civilization of the West. History has taught us the futility of the civilization of the East. Let ours be the civilization of no man, but of all men.

    "text": "The Crisis hastens to extend to you on your accession to the headship of Tuskegee the assurances of its good will and personal respect. The Crisis does this all the more willingly because it has to some extent been the mouthpiece of many who have had occasion repeatedly to criticize the words and deeds of your predecessor.\nIt would be a matter of hope and rejoicing if your assumption of new duties could be the beginning of a new era of union and understanding among the various groups of American Negroes.\nBut understanding and cooperation must be based on frank conference and clear knowledge. As a preliminary step to such understanding the Crisis ventures in this open letter to express to you publicly its hopes and fears.\nIt hopes that the aims of the colored American have become sufficiently clear to admit of no misunderstanding or misstatement. We desire to become American citizens with every right that pertains to citizenship:\n\nThe right to vote and hold office.\nEquality before the law.\nEqual civil rights in all public places, and in all public services.\nA proportional share in the benefits of all public expenditures.\nEducation according to ability and aptitude.\n\nWith these rights we correlate our duties as men and citizens—the abolition of poverty, the emancipation of women, the suppression of crime and the overcoming of ignorance.\nThe Crisis assumes—indeed, it knows—that in these matters you believe substantially, as we do, and that the real differences between us, if there be such, lie in matters of present emphasis and present procedure.\nWe assume, without demur, that following the late Booker T. Washington you will place especial emphasis on vocational training, property getting and conciliation of the white South. These are necessary policies, but they have their pitfalls, and against these The Crisis speaks this warning word:\n\nOnly the higher and broader training will give any race its ultimate leadership. This Mr. Washington came to realize, and this you must not forget.\nIndividual accumulation of wealth must gradually and inevitably give way to methods of social accumulation and equitable distribution,\nFinally: Conciliation is wise and proper. But how far shall it go? It is here that the Crisis confesses to its deepest solicitude in your case. It cannot but remember its unanswered query of you in the case of the St. Louis luncheon. It has before it the heading of a Rochester paper which gives as your opinion that “from North one gets distorted view of South.” And finally, there is the recent case of the Pullman car and your family.\n\nThe Crisis will assume in all of these cases that you have not been correctly reported; that you did not voluntarily give up lunching at the St. Louis City Club; that you did not assert that the South was maligned usually at the North, and above all, that you did not say that you had no sympathy with the attempt of members of your family to ride on Pullman cars in the South.\nThe Crisis knows only too well the way in which Southern newspapers put such sentiments into the mouths of colored leaders; but the point upon which we insist is this: that such atrocious statements cannot be always passed in silence.\nWe do not wish the principal of Tuskegee to spend his valuable time in answering calumnies and misstatements, but we do believe that when so monstrous a statement is made, as in the case of the Pullman car, something besides silence and acquiescence is called for.\nWe hope to see, therefore, at Tuskegee in the future a carrying out and development of the best of its past work and a continued attempt to come to terms of understanding with the best of the white South; but to these policies we hope to see added a policy of making it clearly understood to the people of this country that Tuskegee does believe in the right to vote; that it does not believe in Jim-Crow cars; that it recognizes the work of the Negro colleges, and that it agrees with Charles Sumner that “Equality of rights is the first of rights.”\nThis, then, is the forward step at Tuskegee which the Crisis and its friends look for under your administration, and it desires to express its earnest hope, and indeed its faith, that you will not disappoint your fellow workers,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nThe Present (1917)\nAnother Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson (1913)\nThe Tuskegee Resolutions (1917)\nHelp Us to Help (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “An Open Letter to Robert Russa\nMoton.” The Crisis 12 (4): 169–73. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/12/03/open_letter.html."

    "text": "The Crisis has now for several months been developing a program looking toward an economic forward movement among the Negroes of the United States. The matter has been developed slowly in order to have as large a number of people as possible understand just what it is that The Crisis has in mind.\nThe first duty of a modern citizen is to earn a living; but earning a living today is a complicated thing and it would be a great mistake for Negroes to try the old, individualistic laissez-faire method.\nCo-operation in economics can, perhaps, best be explained by quoting a leaflet by Dr. J. P. Warbasse:\n\nThe Co-operative Movement is an organized non-political effort of the people to control the production and distribution of the things needed to satisfy their wants. It is devoted to the principle that things should be done and commodities produced for use rather than for exchange.”\n \nWith a regularity of increase which has seemed almost fatalistic, the movement has spread. In most European countries the membership in the co-operative societies has about doubled itself every ten years. Now, after three-quarters of a century, in many of these countries the number of people embraced in the movement is passing from a large minority toward a majority of the total population. In some sections it has already become a large majority.\n\nFood, clothing, housing, fuel, insurance, transportation, and entertainment are all provided by cooperative societies for their members. To attain these things has meant, first, the organization of people as consumers, and then production for these organized consumers. This has involved study, consecration, and organization talent. There have been many conflicts with the forces of capitalism, but co-operation has won.\n\nThe powerful combines, with capital, unscrupulous control of politics, and the force of vested interests behind them, have been beaten by organizations largely composed of working people. Co-operation has succeeded against the greatest economic odds. Now the distributing agencies, the lands and mills of the co-operators, have become noteworthy objects of industry. Some of these are among the largest flour mills, shoe factories, clothing factories, canneries and bakeries in the world—all producing things, not for the competitive market, but for the people who own and consume them.\n\nExperience and not theory has developed the fact that the successful co-operative movement which leads straight to the goal, begins with the organization of the people as consumers. These have an immutable economic principle working for them. The consumer has the money; if he has not he cannot consume; or he consumes with somebody’s else money. He and his purse are the aim and object of business. Commerce is addressed to him. It is for him that the honey of trade is spread, music plays, lights sparkle, and all the prostitution of business is made as alluring as genius can contrive. As consumers, business takes off its hat to the workers; bows, flatters and smirks, and licks the dust from their shoes.\n\nWhenever the people organize as consumers, then they begin to enjoy the economic advantages of their organization; not at some remote day, but from the moment they organize; not when all are organized, but when even a few are gathered together.\n\nThese are some of the important things which experience has revealed, and it may be assumed that they will hold as true for the future as for the past.\n\nThis is the movement which The Crisis wishes to bring more and more to the attention of the Negroes of the United States. It firmly believes that this is our economic way out, our industrial emancipation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMore Suggestions (1917)\nThe Present (1917)\nEugene Debs (1926)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nOur Class Struggle (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1918. “Co-Operation.” The Crisis\n15 (1): 9–10. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/15/01/cooperation.html."

    "text": "Three bishops sat in San Francisco, New Orleans and New York, peering gloomily into three flickering fires which cast and recast shuddering shadows on book-lined walls. Three letters lay in their laps and said:\n“And thou, Valdosta, in the land of Georgia, art not least among the princes of America, for out of thee shall come a Governor who shall rule my people.”\nThe white Bishop of New York scowled and impatiently threw the paper into the fire.\n“Valdosta?” he said, “that’s where I go to the Governor’s wedding—little Marguerite, my white flower—” Then he forgot the writing in his musing; but the paper flared red in the fireplace.\n“Valdosta?” said the black bishop In New Orleans, and turned uneasily in his chair. “I must go down there. Those colored folk are acting strangely. I don’t know where all this unrest and moving will lead to. Then, there’s poor Lucy—” And he threw the letter into the fire; but eyed it suspiciously, as it flamed green.\n“Stranger things than that have happened,” he said slowly, “and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars…, for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.”\nIn San Francisco the priest of Japan, abroad to study strange lands, sat in his lacquer chair with face like soft yellow and wrinkled parchment. Slowly he wrote in a great and golden book:\n“I have been strangely bidden to the Vale of Dosta where one of those religious cults that swarm here will welcome a Prophet. I shall go and report to Kioto.”\nSo, in the dim waning of the day before Christmas, three bishops met in Valdosta and saw its mills and storehouses, its wide-throated and sandy streets in the mellow glow of a crimson sun. The governor glared anxiously up the street as he helped the Bishop of New York into his car and welcomed him graciously.\n“I am troubled,” he said, “about the Niggers. They are acting queer. I’m not certain but Fleming is back of it.”\n“Fleming?”\n“Yes; he’s running against me next term for governor; he’s a fire-brand; wants niggers to vote and all that— Pardon me a moment, there’s a darky I know—” and he hurried to the black bishop, who had just descended from the “Jim Crow” car, and clasped his hand cordially. They talked in whispers.\n“Search diligently,” said the governor in parting, “and bring me word again.” Then returning to his Guest: “You will excuse me, won’t you?” he said, “but I am sorely troubled. I never saw niggers act so. They’re leaving by the hundreds and those who stay are getting impudent. They seem to be expecting something. What’s the crowd. Jim?”\nThe chauffeur said that there was some sort of Chinese official in town and everybody wanted to glimpse him. He drove around another way.\nIt all happened very suddenly. The Bishop of New York, in full canonicals for the early wedding, stepped out on the rear balcony of his mansion, just as the dying sun lit crimson clouds of glory in the East and burned the West.\n“Fire!” yelled a wag in the surging crowd that was gathering to celebrate a southern Christmas Eve; all laughed and ran.\nThe bishop did not understand. He peered around. Was it that dark little house in the far back yard that flamed? Forgetful of his robes, he hurried down—a brave white figure in the sunset. He found himself before an old black rickety stable. He could hear the mules stamping within.\nNo, it was not fire. It was the sunset glowing through the cracks. Behind the hut its glory rose toward God like flaming wings of Cherubim. He paused until he heard the faint wail of a child. Hastily he entered. A white girl crouched before him, down by the very mules’ feet, with a baby in her arms A little mite of a baby that wailed weakly. Behind mother and child stood a shadow. The bishop turned to the right, inquiringly, and saw a black man in bishop’s robes that faintly echoed his own. Hastily he turned away to the left and saw a golden Japanese in golden garb. Then he heard the black man mutter behind him:\n“But He was to come the second time in clouds of glory, with the nations gathered around Him and angels—” at the word a shaft of glorious light fell full upon the child, while without came the tramping of unnumbered feet and the whirring of winds.\nThe Bishop of New York bent quickly above the baby.\nIt was black!\nThe bishop stepped back with a gesture of disgust, hardly listening to and yet hearing the black bishop who spoke almost as if in apology:\n“She ain’t really white; I know Lucy—you see, her mother worked for the Governor—” The bishop turned on his heel and nearly trod on the yellow priest, who knelt with bowed head before the pale mother and offered incense and a gift of gold.\nOut into the night rushed the bishop. The wings of the Cherubim were folded back against the stars. As he hastened down the front stair-case the governor came rushing up the street steps.\n“We are late,” he cried nervously. “The Bride awaits.” He hurried the bishop to the waiting limousine, asking him anxiously:\n“Did you hear anything? Do you hear that noise? The crowd is growing strangely on the streets and there seems to be a fire over toward the East. I never saw so many people here—I fear violence—a mob—a lynching—hark!” What was that which the Bishop, too, heard beneath the rhythm of unnumbered feet? Deep in his heart a wonder grew. What was it? Ah, he knew. It was music—some strong and mighty chord. It rose higher as the brilliantly-lighted church split the night and swept radiantly toward them. So high and clear that music flew, it seemed above, around, behind them. The governor, ashen-faced, crouched in the car; but the bishop said softly as the ecstasy pulsed in his heart:\n“Such music, such wedding music! What choir is it?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Crusade (1914)\nFall Books (1924)\nBurleson (1913)\nThe Massacre in East St. Louis (1917)\nUnrest (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1917. “The Second Coming.”\nThe Crisis 15 (2): 59–60. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/15/02/second_coming.html."

    "text": "I am among the few colored men who have tried conscientiously to bring about understanding and co-operation between American Negroes and the Labor Unions. I have sought to look upon the Sons of Freedom as simply a part of the great mass of the earth’s Disinherited, and to realize that world movements which have lifted the lowly in the past and are opening the gates of opportunity to them today are of equal value for all men, white and black, then and now.\nI carry on the title page, for instance, of this magazine the Union label, and yet I know, and everyone of my Negro readers knows, that the very fact that this label is there is an advertisement that no Negro’s hand is engaged in the printing of this magazine, since the International Typographical Union systematically and deliberately excludes every Negro that it dares from membership, no matter what his qualifications.\nEven here, however, and beyond the hurt of mine own, I have always striven to recognize the real cogency of the Union argument. Collective bargaining has, undoubtedly, raised modern labor from something like chattel slavery to the threshold of industrial freedom, and in this advance of labor white and black have shared.\nI have tried, therefore, to see a vision of vast union between the laboring forces, particularly in the South, and hoped for no distant day when the black laborer and the white laborer, instead of being used against each other as helpless pawns, should unite to bring real democracy in the South.\nOn the other hand, the whole scheme of settling the Negro problem, inaugurated by philanthropists and carried out during the last twenty years, has been based upon the idea of playing off black workers against white. That it is essentially a mischievous and dangerous pro­ gram no sane thinker can deny, but it is peculiarly disheartening to realize that it is the Labor Unions themselves that have given this movement its greatest impulse and that today, at last, in East St. Louis have brought the most unwilling of us to acknowledge that in the present Union movement, as represented by the American Federation of Labor, there is absolutely no hope of justice for an American of Negro descent.\nPersonally, I have come to this decision reluctantly and in the past have written and spoken little of the closed door of opportunity, shut impudently in the faces of black men by organized white workingmen. I realize that by heredity and century-long lack of opportunity one cannot expect in the laborer that larger sense of justice and duty which we ought to demand of the privileged classes. I have, therefore, inveighed against color discrimination by employers and by the rich and well-to-do, knowing at the same time in silence that it is practically impossible for any colored man or woman to become a boiler maker or book binder, an electrical worker or glass maker, a worker in jewelry or leather, a machinist or metal polisher, a paper maker or piano builder, a plumber or a potter, a printer or a pressman, a telegrapher or a railway trackman, an electrotyper or stove mounter, a textile worker or tile layer, a trunk maker, upholsterer, carpenter, loco­ motive engineer, switchman, stone cutter, baker, blacksmith, boot and shoemaker, tailor, or any of a dozen other important well-paid employments, without encountering the open determination and unscrupulous opposition of the whole united labor movement of America. That further than this, if he should want to be­ come a painter, mason, carpenter, plasterer, brickmaker or fireman he would be subject to humiliating dis­criminations by his fellow Union workers and be deprived of work at every possible opportunity, even in defiance of their own Union laws. If, braving this outrageous attitude of the Unions, he succeeds in some small establishment or at some exceptional time at gaining employment, he must be labeled as a “scab” throughout the length and breadth of the land and written down as one who, for his selfish advantage, seeks to over­ throw the labor uplift of a century.\nThe recent convention of the American Federation of Labor, at Buffalo, is no proof of change of heart. Grudgingly, unwillingly, almost insultingly, this Federation yields to us inch by inch the status of half-a-man, denying and withholding every privilege it dares at all times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nWhite Co-Workers (1920)\nRadicals (1919)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nCriteria of Negro Art (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1918. “The Black Man and the Unions.”\nThe Crisis 15 (5): 214. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/15/05/the_black_man_and_the_unions.html."

The need of continued philanthropic aid to private schools is emphasized and there are several good maps. Despite, then, some evidently careless proofreading (pages 59, 129, 157), the ordinary reader unacquainted with the tremendous ramifications of the Negro problem will hail this report with unstinted praise.\nThinking Negroes, however, and other persons who know the problem of educating the American Negro will regard the Jones’ report, despite its many praiseworthy features, as a dangerous and in many respects unfortunate publication."

    "title": "Negro Education",
    "section": "The Negro College",
    "text": "The Negro College\nThe whole trend of Mr. Jones’ study and of his general recommendations is to make the higher training of Negroes practically difficult, if not impossible, despite the fact that his statistics show (in 1914-15) only 1643 colored students studying college subjects in all the private Negro schools out of 12,726 pupils. He shows that there are (in proportion to population) ten times as many whites in the public high schools as there are colored pupils and only sixty-four public high schools for Negroes in the whole South! He shows that even at present there are few Negro colleges and that they have no easy chance for survival. What he is criticising, then, is not the fact that Negroes are tumbling into college in enormous numbers, but their wish to go to college and their endeavor to support and maintain even poor college departments.\nWhat, in fact, is back of this wish? Is it merely a silly desire to study “Greek,” as Mr. Jones several times intimates, or is it not rather a desire on the part of American Negroes to develop a class of thoroughly educated men according to modern standards? If such a class is to be developed these Negro colleges must be planned as far as possible according to the standards of white colleges, otherwise colored students would be shut out of the best colleges of the country.\nThe curriculum offered at the colored southern colleges, however, brings the author’s caustic criticism. Why, for instance, should “Greek and Latin” be maintained to the exclusion of economics, sociology, and “a strong course in biology?”\nThe reason for the maintenance of these older courses of study in the colored colleges is not at all, as the author assumes, that Negroes have a childish love for “classics.” It is very easily and simply explicable. Take, for instance, Fisk University. Fisk University maintained Greek longer than most northern colleges, for the reason that it had in Adam K. Spence not simply a finished Greek scholar, pupil of the great D’Ooge, but a man of singularly strong personality and fine soul. It did not make much difference whether the students were studying Greek or Biology—the great thing was that they were studying under Spence. So, in a large number of cases the curriculum of the southern Negro college has been determined by the personnel of the available men. These men were beyond price and working for their devotion to the cause. The college was unable to call men representing the newer sciences—young sociologists and biologists. They were unable to equip laboratories, but they did with infinite pains and often heartbreaking endeavor keep within touch of the standard set by the higher northern schools and the proof that they did well came from the men they turned out and not simply from the courses they studied.\nThis, Mr. Jones either forgets or does not know and is thus led into exceedingly unfortunate statements as when, for instance, he says that the underlying principle of the industrial school “is the adaptation of educational activities whether industrial or literary to the needs of the pupils and the community,” which is, of course, the object of any educational institution and it is grossly unfair to speak of it as being the object of only a part of the great Negro schools of the South. Any school that does not have this for its object is not a school but a fraud."

    "section": "The Public Schools",
    "text": "The Public Schools\nNot only does this report continually decry the Negro college and its curriculum but, on the other hand, it seeks to put in its place schools and courses of study which make it absolutely impossible for Negro students to be thoroughly trained according to modern standards. To illustrate: Mr. Jones shows (page 90) that in Butte, Mont., manual training has been put into the elementary schools at the rate of half a day a week during the first six years and two half days a week in the seventh and eighth grades. When, however, it comes to the smaller elementary industrial schools of the South Mr. Jones recommends one-half day classroom work and one-half practice in the field and shops every day.\nWhat, now, is the real difference between these two schemes of education? The difference is that in the Butte schools for white pupils a chance is held open for the pupil to go through high school and college and to advance at the rate which the modern curriculum demands; that in the colored schools, on the other hand, a program is being made out that will land the boy at the time he becomes self-conscious and aware of his own possibilities in an educational impasse. He cannot go on in the public schools even if he should move to a place where there are good public schools because he is too old. Even if he has done the elementary work in twice the time that a student is supposed to it has been work of a kind that will not admit him to a northern high school. No matter, then, how gifted the boy may be he is absolutely estopped from a higher education. This is not only unfair to the boy but it is grossly unfair to the Negro race.\nThe argument, then, against the kind of school that is being foisted upon Negroes in the name of industrial education is not any dislike on the part of the Negroes for having their children trained in vocations, or in having manual training used as a means of education; it is rather in having a series of schools established which deliberately shut the door of opportunity in the face of bright Negro students."

    "text": "Industrial Training\nWith the drive that has been made to industrialize elementary schools before the children have learned to read and write and to turn the high schools to vocational teaching without giving any of the pupils a chance to train for college, it is, of course, beside the mark to criticize the colored colleges because the children that come to them are poorly trained.\nMuch of the criticism of colored teachers is also unfair. Even well-trained teachers are having curious pressure put upon them. Here is a teacher with eighty or one hundred pupils trying to teach them three r’s in a country district. The Jeanes Fund sends a supervisor and introduces, to quote the report (page 35), “shuck mat work, simple sewing, patch quilting for girls, repair of buildings and woodworking for boys.” It might be possible with money and teachers so to interlock this work with the teaching of the three r’s as to help the net result; but when the stress, the emphasis, and the inspection has to do mainly with the industrial work as such, and nobody knows or cares about the chief work for which the school ought to exist; when the white community demands .of these schools servants and laborers and not educated men and women, what is the result bound to be?\nWith its insistent criticising of Negro colleges this report touches with curious hesitation and diffidence upon the shortcomings of industrial schools. Their failure to distinguish between general education and technical trade training has resulted in sending out numbers of so-called teachers from educational schools who cannot read and write the English language and who are yet put in public and other schools as teachers. They may show children how to make tin pans and cobble shoes, but they are not the right persons to train youth, mentally or morally. In the second place, most of the trades taught by these trade schools are, because of hostile public opinion and poverty, decadent trades: carpentry, which is rapidly falling below the level of skilled trades; the patching of shoes; blacksmithing, in the sense of repair work, etc. The important trades of the world that are today assembled in factories and call for skilled technique and costly machinery are not taught in the vast majority of Negro industrial schools. Moreover, the higher industrial training calls for more education than the industrial schools give. I remember some ten years ago going into the wheel-wrighting shop at Hampton. I said to the white instructor: “How are your students getting on?” He said: “Fairly well, only they haven’t enough mathematics.” Yet here is a report that has much to say over the foolishness of teaching mathematics!\nThat the course of study in the Southern schools as well as in the schools of the nation has got to be changed and adapted is absolutely true, but the object of a school system is to carry the child as far as possible in its knowledge of the accumulated wisdom of the world and then when economic or physical reasons demand that this education must stop, vocational training to prepare for life work should follow. That some of this vocational training may be made educational in object is true; that normal training may use manual training and even to some extent vocational training is true, but it is not true that the industrializing of any curriculum necessarily makes it better or that you can at one and the same time educate the race in modern civilization and train it simply to be servants and laborers. Anyone who suggests by sneering at books and “literary courses” that the great heritage of human thought ought to be displaced simply for the reason of teaching the technique of modern industry is pitifully wrong and, if the comparison must be made, more wrong than the man who would sacrifice modern technique to the heritage of ancient thought."

    "title": "Negro Education",
    "section": "Cooperation",
    "text": "Cooperation\nThe second part of Mr. Jones’ thesis lies in an insistence that the private schools of the Negro should “cooperate” with the South. He stresses the adaptation of education to the needs of the “community” (page 18), evidently meaning the white community. He quotes on page 25 the resolution of the white Southern Educational Association which deplores that the Negro schools are isolated from the “community,” meaning again the white community. He instances Willcox County, Ala., where there are almost no public schools and recommends that the private schools established there be put under “community” authorities (page 149). Now what is this “community” with which the colored people are to cooperate?\nIn the first place, Mr. Jones admits (pages 4 and 5), that it is only the progressive few in the white South that care anything at all about Negro schools. He might go even further and acknowledge that if a plebescite were taken tomorrow in the South the popular vote of white people would shut every single Negro school by a large majority. The hostile majority is kept from such radical action by the more progressive minority and by fear of northern interference, but the condition in which they have today left the colored schools is shown by this report to be truly lamentable.\nMr. Jones quotes from Southern white men who speak of Negro school houses as “miserable beyond all description,” of teachers as “absolutely untrained” and paid “the princely fortune of $80.92 for the whole term.” He goes on with fact after fact to show the absolute inadequacy in the provision for colored children in the public schools of the South. On the other hand, he shows the increase in Negro property, the larger and larger amounts which Negroes are contributing to the school funds; and with all this he practically asks that the domination of the Negro private schools, which are now bearing the burden of nearly all the secondary and higher education of the Negro and much of the elementary education—that the domination of these schools be put into the hands of the same people who are doing so little for the public schools!\nThere is not in the whole report a single word about taxation without representation. There is not a single protest against a public school system in which the public which it serves has absolutely no voice, vote, or influence. There is no defense of those colored people of vision who see the public schools being used as training schools for cheap labor and menial servants instead of for education and who are protesting against this by submitting to double taxation in the support of private schools; who cannot see that these schools should be turned over to people who by their actions prove themselves to be enemies of the Negro race and its advancement.\nUntil the southern Negro has a vote and representation on school boards public control of his education will mean his spiritual and economic death and that despite the good intentions of the small white minority in the South who believe in justice for the Negro. It is, therefore, contradictory for this report to insist, on the one hand, on the continuation of northern philanthropy for these schools and, on the other, to command various southern schools in proportion as they have gained the approval of the white community.\nCompare, for instance, Fisk University and Atlanta University. Both Cravath of Fisk and Ware of Atlanta were men radical in their belief in Negro possibility and in their determination to establish well equipped Negro colleges. Cravath, however, lived in a more enlightened community which was earlier converted to his ideals. He did not yield his opinion any more than Ware, but Ware lived in a community that to this day will not furnish even a high school for its colored pupils. To say that Fisk should receive on this account more support than Atlanta is rank injustice; if anything Atlanta deserves the greater credit.\nCooperation with the white South means in many cases the surrender of the very foundations of self-respect. Mr. Jones inserts in his report one picture of a colored principal and his assistant waiting on table while the white trustees of his school eat. The colored people of the South do not care a rap whether white folks eat with them or not, but if white officials are coming into their schools as persons in control or advisors, then to ask that in those schools and in their homes the colored people shall voluntarily treat themselves as inferiors is to ask more than any self-respecting man is going to do.\nThe white community, undoubtedly, wants to keep the Negro in the country as a peasant under working conditions least removed from slavery. The colored man wishes to escape from those conditions. Mr. Jones seeks to persuade him to stay there by asserting that the advance of the Negro in the rural South has been greatest (pages 97 and 123), and he refers to the “delusion” of city life even among white people. This may be all good enough propaganda but, in fact, it is untrue. Civilization has always depended upon the cities. The advance of the cities has been greatest for all people, white and colored, and for any colored man to take his family to the country districts of South Georgia in order to grow and develop and secure education and uplift would be idiotic.\nMr. Jones touches the State schools very lightly. Here are cases where the whites have control and stories of graft and misappropriation of funds and poor organization are well known to everybody with the slightest knowledge of southern conditions. Teachers there and in the public schools are often selected not from the best available, but from the worst or most complacent. In small towns and country districts white trustees may maintain their mistresses as teachers and the protest of the colored people has fallen upon deaf ears. Until, then, colored people have a voice in the community, surrender to the domination of the white South is unthinkable."

    "section": "Norther Philanthropy",
    "text": "Norther Philanthropy\nThis brings us to the third part of Mr. Jones’ thesis, namely, that the boards working for southern education should unite as far as possible with one policy. This is an unfortunate and dangerous proposal for the simple reason that the great dominating philanthropic agency, the General Education Board, long ago surrendered to the white South by practically saying that the educational needs of the white South must be attended to before any attention should be paid to the education of Negroes; that the Negro must be trained according to the will of the white South and not as the Negro desires to be trained. It is this board that is spending more money today in helping Negroes learn how to can vegetables than in helping them to go through college. It is this board that by a system of interlocking directorates bids fair to dominate philanthropy toward the Negro in the United States. Indeed, the moving thought back of the present report is the idea of a single authority who is to say which Negro school is right or is wrong, which system is right and which is wrong, etc.\nNo one doubts the efficiency of concentration and unity in certain lines of work but always, even in work that can be unified, the question is whose influence is going to dominate; it may well be that diversity and even a certain chaos would be better than unity under a wrong idea. This is even more true in educational than in economic matters. Of course, the economic foundation of all recent educational philanthropy, particularly toward the Negro, is evident. Mr. Jones rather naively speaks of the fact that at certain times of the year “it is exceedingly difficult to prevail upon children to attend school” in the colored South which is, of course, another way of saying that bread and butter in the cotton fields is of more importance than trained intelligence.\nUndoubtedly, there has already been a strong public opinion manufactured in the country which looks upon the training of Negroes in the South as cheap, contented labor to be used in emergency and for keeping white union labor from extravagant demands as a feasible and workable program. It is, in fact, one of the most dangerous programs ever thought out and is responsible for much of the lynching, unrest, and unhappiness in the South. Its genesis came easily with the idea of working for the Negro rather than working with him, a thing which Mr. Jones condemns, but hardly lives up to his condemnation.\nIn this very report the Negro was practically unrepresented. Instead of choosing a strong, experienced colored man to represent the Negro race (like W. T. B. Williams, or President Young of Tallahassee, or President Hope of Morehouse) an inexperienced young man was taken, of excellent character but absolutely without weight or influence. Of course, back of all this is the great difficulty of ordinary social intercourse. The reason that boards of trustees like those that control the Phelps-Stokes Fund find it so much easier to work for the Negro than with him; the reason that forgetting the investigations by Negroes at Atlanta University they turned to white institutions to encourage investigation and neglected established and worthy work is because if they are going to cooperate with the dominant white South and even with certain classes of Northerners they cannot meet Negroes as men. The propaganda that is so largely carried on and the influence that is so often formed through social intercourse must always, at present, be offered with the Negro unrepresented and unheard.\nThere follows easily the habit of having no patience with the man who does not agree with the decisions of such boards. The Negro who comes with his hat in his hand and flatters and cajoles the philanthropist—that Negro gets money. If these foundations raise, as they do in this report, the cry of fraud they have themselves to thank. They more than any other agency have encouraged that kind of person. On the other hand, the Negro who shows the slightest independence of thought or character is apt to be read out of all possible influence not only by the white South but by the philanthropic North.\nIf philanthropic agencies could unite for certain obvious great movements how splendid it would be! Take, for instance, the duplication of higher educational schools which Mr. Jones repeatedly denounces and which, undoubtedly, is a source of weakness. The General Education Board could settle the matter with the greatest ease. Let it offer in Atlanta an endowment of $500,000 for a single Negro college, provided that there be but one college there for Negroes. The boards of the different schools immediately would have something to act upon. As it is nothing that they can do individually would really better the situation. A new college formed by a federation of colored colleges in Atlanta, Marshall, Texas, and elsewhere, would be easily possible if an endowment was in sight."

Not only does it probably mark the ending of a system of private profit, based upon so general and standardized a necessity as travel, but it goes further than that. With the proper administration in Washington, it means the end of the “Jim-Crow” car, for with the government as owner, what state can prescribe conditions of travel?\nMoreover, the railway unions have absolutely excluded colored men. Only white men can belong to the conductors’ union, the engineers’ union, the switchmen’s union, the firemen’s union, etc. If the government continues to hold the railways after the war, and this is more than probable, these union men will become civil servants. Any person passing the requisite examination, be he white or black, can enter this service, and he cannot be excluded from the unions.\nIt is, therefore, the business of every black voter to see that the railways of the United States never revert again to private hands; and then to use his growing political power in the North to oust the southern oligarchy from its entrenched power in Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBurleson (1913)\nRailroad Unions (1921)\nEducation (1913)\nSupreme Court (1914)\nThe “Jim Crow” Argument (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1918. “The Railroads.” The Crisis\n15 (4): 164–65. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/15/04/railroads.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "India has been called a land of saints, the home of religions, and, living up to her well earned reputation, she produces in our own time a man who from sheer impeccability of character, and extraordinary personality, and from loftiness and originality of doctrine and ideas, takes rank at once among the great men of the world whose mark is high enough to make for them a permanent niche in the repository of the benefactors of mankind.\nNo man who is in the least interested in the throbbing mass of peoples of the earth can fail to take notice of this exceptional soul called forth by a great need and destined to make a significant contribution to the very human effort which man is putting forth to get himself out of the encircling gloom into the promised land. I say “destined,” but that is to detract from the glory which already enshrines Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. I should speak in the present instead of the future tense, for the man about whom I write, not only will be but is indeed he is so vital a factor that he is called at once the most dangerous yet the most beloved man in India today.\nWhen Lord Reading, the newly appointed viceroy of India, reached that country, one of his first acts was a long heart to heart talk with Mr. Gandhi. Writing in the London Nation, a member of parliament says:\n\nThe saint, or Mahatma (Gandhi) has India at his feet. The ‘intellegentsia’ differ from him sometimes in private, rarely in public; property differs from him and trembles; the government—any government differs from him and thinks it is best to—wait.\n\nTo ask who this man Gandhi is, is to ask more than one can properly answer. To many of his Indian countrymen he is Mahatma, or saint, a human being in touch with the divine, to bring relief to the suffering, food to the hungry, and satisfaction to the other physical wants of India; to enthusiastic and idealistic students and members of the educated class, and to many leaders in political life he is the embodiment of a great challenge, which, if answered, must lead out into the possession of not only that which the body needs and must have, but into that indefinable realm of the mind and spirit, the imponderable kingdom of the soul—a possession which may sound very theoretical and impracticable, yet one which is the very stuff that life, and living, human well being, and achievement are made of.\nMr. Ben Spoor of the British Labor Party, who went to India to represent that organization at the Indian National Congress, writes:\n\nThe West has produced a Lenin, strong, masterful, relentless alike in logic and method. The East has given birth to a Gandhi, equally strong, masterful and relentless. But whilst the former pins his faith on force, the latter relies on non-resistance. One trusts the sword, the other the spirit. In an extraordinary manner these men appear to incarnate those fundamentally opposing forces that—behind all the surface struggle of our day—are striving for the mastery.\n\nA learned man of India writes that no one can understand Mr. Gandhi’s crusade who does not know Mr. Gandhi. Let us dispose briefly of the common facts of his life and then undertake to see the man as he is.\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born of an old Bania family, resident in Kathiawar, India, October 2, 1869. Politics appears to be the heritage of his fathers. Through business enterprise they had accumulated some wealth. His mother, an orthodox Hindu lady, rigidly observing religious obligations, performing in the highest manner her duties as wife and mother, could be expected to demand of her children the most desirable qualities of character. From the records one reads, young Gandhi was no disappointment to her. Mohandas Gandhi received his early training in Kathiawar and his final academic instruction in London, where he qualified as a barrister-at-law. It is reported of him during his stay in London, that he was rich and clever, of a cultivated family, gentle and modest in manner. He dressed and behaved like other people. There was nothing particular about him to show that he had taken a Jain vow to abstain from wine, from flesh, and from sexual intercourse. He took his degree and became a successful lawyer in Bombay, but he cared more for religion than for law. Gradually his asceticism began to show itself. He gave away all his money to good causes, except the most meagre allowance. He took vows of poverty. He gradually ceased a large part of his practice at law because his religion forbade him to take part in a system which tried to do right by violence.\nThe beginning of Mr. Gandhi’s larger life was in South Africa, whither he had been induced to go in connection with an Indian legal case of some difficulty. It is worth while to relate his first experience after disembarking at the port of Durban in Natal. Brought up in the British tradition of the equality of all British subjects, an honored guest in the capital of the Empire, he found that in the colony of Natal he was regarded as an outcast. When he applied for admission as an advocate of the supreme court of Natal, he was opposed by the law society on the ground that the law did not contemplate that a colored person should practice. Fortunately, the supreme court viewed the matter in another light and granted the application, but Mr. Gandhi received sudden warning of what awaited him in years to come.\nIf this was the test of fire through which a great man was to pass, it was certainly not a fire which consumed, but rather one which kindled all the nobler qualities of his soul, and sent him forth purged of whatever dross he may have had—Mahatma Gandhi, both feared and loved. Professor Gilbert Murray, writing in the Hibbert Journal, relates the significant part of Mr. Gandhi’s South African experience:\n\nIn South Africa, there are some 150,000 Indians, chiefly in Natal, and the South African government, feeling that the color question in its territories was quite sufficiently difficult already, determined to prevent the immigration of any more Indians and if possible to expel those who were already there. This could not be done. It violated a treaty; it was opposed by Natal, where much of the industry depended on Indian labor; and it was objected to by the Indian government and the home government. Then began a long struggle. The whites of South Africa determined to make life in South Africa undesirable, if not for all Indians, at least for all Indians above the coolie class. Indians were specially taxed; were made to register in a degrading way; their thumb prints were taken by the police as if they were criminals. If, owing to the scruples of the government, the law was in any case too lenient, patriotic mobs undertook to remedy the defect. Quite early in the struggle the Indians in South Africa asked Mr. Gandhi to come and help them. He came as a barrister in 1893; he was forbidden to plead; he proved his right to plead; he won his case against the Asiatic Exclusion Act on grounds of constitutional law and returned to India.\n\nGandhi came again in 1895. He was almost mobbed and nearly killed at Durban. I will not tell in detail how he settled down eventually in South Africa as a leader and counsellor to his people; how he began a settlement in the country outside Durban where the workers should live directly on the land and be bound by a vow of poverty. For many years he was engaged in constant passive resistance to the government and constant efforts to raise and ennoble the inward life of the Indian community. But he was unlike other strikers or resisters in this: that mostly the resister takes advantage of any difficulty of the government in order to press his claim the harder. Mr. Gandhi, when the government was in any difficulty that he thought serious, always relaxed his resistance and offered help. In 1899 came the Boer War. Gandhi immediately organized an Indian Red Cross Unit. There arose a popular movement for refusing it and treating it as seditious. But it was needed. The soldiers wanted it; it served throughout the war, and was mentioned in dispatches and thanked publicly for its skillful work and courage under fire. In 1904 there was an outbreak of plague in Johannesburg, and Mr. Gandhi had a private hospital opened before the government had begun to act. In 1906 there was a native rebellion in Natal. Gandhi raised and personally led a corps of stretcher bearers whose work seems to have proved particularly dangerous and painful. Gandhi was thanked by the governor of Natal and shortly afterward thrown in jail in Johannesburg.\n\nLastly, in 1913, when he was being repeatedly thrown into prison among prisoners of the lowest class and his followers in jail were to the number of 2,500; in the very midst of the general strike of Indians in the Transvaal and in Natal, there occurred the sudden and dangerous strike which endangered for a time the very existence of the organized society in South Africa. From the ordinary agitator’s point of view, the game was in Gandhi’s hands. He had only to strike his hardest. Instead, he gave orders for his people to resume work until the government should be safe again, I cannot say how often he was imprisoned, how often mobbed and assaulted, and what pains were taken to mortify and humiliate him in public. But by 1913 the Indian case had been taken up by Lord Hardinge and the government of India. An imperial commission reported in his favor on most of the points at issue and an act was passed entitled the Indian Relief Act.\n\nManifestly, a man of such lofty ideals, so perfectly displayed in practice is bound to exert no small influence in a country like India at this period of her life. In order to understand the man himself in relation to his country it is perhaps necessary to observe a few facts of the political history of India.\nIndia was the contemporary of great Egypt, ancient Assyria and Persia, but unlike her contemporaries of antiquity, she lives. They are dead. Through a continuous period running back to most archaic times, she has come with her literature, her religions, her customs—in short—with all that makes her justly proud today. One could go on and state what has become the classic theme of the demands of contemporary India. We cannot consider here the interesting facts of her kingdoms and empires, her wars and warriors, of which the Mahabharata so gloriously sings; nor of the coming of Islam and the great empires of the Moguls. It is certainly not possible to write here of Indian society—-of caste; of poverty widespread and dazzling wealth; of the depth of illiteracy which grips the country octopus-like and a culture and education as noted for their literary and scholarly achievements as for their far reach back into the haze of unhistorical days; of marriage, home, and the family.\nIndia has for centuries been a land much desired by Europe. Every school boy remembers that it was this land that Columbus sought in 1492. The immense wealth of that country as it lured on the bold discoverer of America, in the same way was the object of expeditions of the Portuguese, Dutch, French, Austrians and Germans. The tragic results of their seeking, both to themselves and to India, form interesting yet harrowing reading. Intrigue, murder, robbery—wholesale pillage—all for the wealth of the Indies!\nIn 1600 Queen Elizabeth granted a charter to what became known later as the East India Company. This company established in India trading-posts and settlements and built forts to protect its ports and settlements. It sent out governors and a governor-general and when it applied at London for charters and courts of justice, it got charters and courts of justice; then follows the sordid yet romantic periods of Warren Hastings, Lord Clive and others (see Macaulay and Burke), until the East India Company ceased to exist in the Sepoy War of 1857 and the British crown assumed the sovereignty of this country and its millions in 1858. Upon and out of this more than half-century of foreign rule, a rule of which one reads great good and much evil, comes what is today termed “Indian unrest,” and upon the very crest of this wave Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi occupies his position.\nThese 315,000,000 people, largely poor and illiterate, though with a highly cultured and educated leadership, what is it they want and in what is it that Gandhi is for many of them the spokesman? In the past the leaders have with their might protested against a bureaucratic government vested in a foreign civil service. Indian national gatherings of the past have recommended again and again that “measures be taken by government to organize and develop Indian industries,” and also “that invidious distinctions here and abroad between his Majesty’s Indian and other subjects be removed by redeeming pledges of provincial autonomy and recognizing India as a component part of a federated empire. At the December meeting of the National Liberal Federation the Hon. Mr. Srinivasa Sastri moved that in the opinion of the Federation, the inauguration of the new régime conferring a measure of self-government on the people of India must be signalized by a comprehensive measure abolishing all distinctions in law based merely on the race of an individual, and urged in particular that provisions in the criminal law of India conferring upon Europeans and Americans certain privileges and rights must be repealed at an early date.”\nOne could mention an almost unending list of complaints, demands, memorials and resolutions. Each year it appears the leaders of the people have become more bold and have given increased expression to their larger and national aspiration. A demand granted has only served to reveal their miserable weakness and the mighty strength of the power that granted it. Thus has a new state of mind come upon this country almost with the suddenness of the dawn of day but with the same surety of travel and background as that upon which dawn depends. Instead of a half loaf, the whole is desired. The same sort of patience is no longer advocated and a conditional loyalty to the British Empire is preached.\nWithout doubt the war primarily and other subsequent developments have given the immediate impetus to the rising tide of new and popular thought. But it is possible for almost every Indian to name specifically definite overt acts and administrative measures which led an erstwhile patient and philosophic people into a state which an unfriendly reporter characterizes as “an atmosphere surcharged with heat and an horizon obscured by smoke screens of racial passion.” Of the overt acts, the one which touched the very quick of the people’s heart, was the Amritsar massacre whereby several hundred Indian men, women and children were shot dead under the order of a British general and hundreds of others were left wounded. And this because these unarmed people refused to obey the order of the British general to disperse!\nIn the second place, the Moslems of India are dissatisfied over the turn events have taken during the past three years which, they claim, humiliate Islam and completely subjugates the Mohammedan world to the Christian. Their deepest feelings are stirred over what is to them a studied insult to their religion. The very heart of India’s racial self-respect is stirred. But behind these two questions just referred to the New Republic states: “There is a greater and all embracing one, that of national wrong and shame of which every Indian is sensitive.”\nUpon a governmental report on the Amritsar massacre. Mr. Gandhi writes: “The condonation of the Punjab atrocities has completely shattered my faith in the good intentions of the government and the nation supporting it.” Writing on “the situation and the remedy,” Mr. G. A. Natesan, an Indian, finishes with the remark, “The people of India have lost faith in British justice.”\nThus begins the newer attitude of Indian leaders towards Britain! New terms, or rather old terms with new meanings are now the order of the day. Swaraj, non-coöperation, non-violence, and Gandhism, are the terms which have turned the eyes of the world upon the man responsible for their use, and have won for him the devoted following of great masses of his own people.\nAt the 35th session of the Indian National Congress, held at Nagpur, India, in December, 1920, Mr. Gandhi moved in the open Congress: “That the object of this Congress is the attainment of Swaraj by all legitimate and peaceful ends.” The motion was opposed, but it was carried with a large majority and by its passage it made Mr. Gandhi the most powerful man in the Congress. Mr. Gandhi explains what is meant by Swaraj, or home rule or national rule as follows:\n\nSwaraj means a state such that we can maintain our separate existence without the presence of the English. If it is to be a partnership, it must be a partnership at will. There can be no Swaraj without our feeling and being the equals of Englishmen. Today we feel that we are dependent upon them for our internal and external security, for our armed peace between Hindus and Mussulmans for our education, and for the supply of our daily wants. The Rajahs are dependent upon the British for their power, and the millionaires for their millions. The British know our helplessness … to get Swaraj then is to get rid of our helplessness.\n\nBut how is this great miracle to be wrought in India? Non-coöperation is the war-cry of Mr. Gandhi’s non-violent crusade. It is his first and most powerful weapon. This is the general scheme of the principle of non-coöperation as proposed by the Indian National Congress:\n\nGiving up of all British titles and honorary offices\nBoycott of all official functions\nWithdrawal of all students from all government owned or aided schools, and the establishment of Indian National schools\nBoycott of British courts by Indian lawyers and litigants and the establishment of private courts of arbitration\nRefusal of Indians to be candidates for the new assemblies and the total abstinence from all voting\nBoycott of English-made goods.\n\nIn commenting on the effectiveness of non-coöperation in Mr. Gandhi’s program, Mr. B. K. Roy, a Hindu, writes in the Independent:\n\nMr. Gandhi has fired the imaginations of the people, and the non-coöperation movement is meeting with tremendous success. Many titleholders like Rabindranath Tagore have given up their titles. Women like Sarajina Neidee and Sarala Devi have given back their medals of honor for war-service, thousands of students have left British colleges and national institutions are being established.\n\nThe second outstanding factor in Mr. Gandhi’s program is the idea and practice of non-violence or passive resistance. Like the principle of non-coöperation, it kills without striking its adversary. More than that, it disarms its enemies.\nBehold a man who has ancient and great India at his feet; whom a powerful government is afraid to arrest; who causes visiting members of royalty to be snubbed; who threatens as a last resort to lead his people in an anti-tax paying crusade, thus striking at the very root of government; a man who professes to love his enemies and who refuses to take advantage of or embarrass government in a crisis!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nIndia (1930)\nThe Durbar (1912)\nEgypt and India (1919)\nTo The World (1921)\nA Philosophy in Time of War (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “Gandhi and India.”\nThe Crisis 23 (5): 203–7. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/23/05/india_and_gandhi.html."

    "text": "There is a species of propaganda going on against the Negro which is so subtle that most people do not notice it. For instance, The Spectator, an insurance magazine periodical, records from year to year all homicides,—that is all persons killed in the United States by criminal violence. It notes that for every million of population in 31 cities there are 85 homicides and that the rate is increasing.\nThen the statement, which is written by Frederick L. Hoffman, goes on to say (the italics are ours): “Furthermore, it will be noted that the cities experiencing the highest rates are those having a large colored population.” And comparing North and South, he says that the homicide rate among the whites in the South “is but little higher than for the New England and Middle Atlantic States and below that for the West. For the colored race the incidence is shown to be four times as frequent as among the whites in the South.”\nNow what is the inference that any number of papers quoting this passage have made? It is that the Negro is a murderer and causes the great murder rate in the South. And yet as a matter of fact, what is the truth? The truth is that the Negro is MURDERED four times as fast as the whites and that the unfortunate preëminence of the South in murder is because there are so many black folk there to be killed.\nIn other words, a fact which is to the shame of the white race and pitiable for the colored race, is, we had almost said, deliberately so stated that nine people out of ten in the United States have twisted the facts to the discredit of the black South.\nThe Crisis itself was so puzzled at the figures that it wrote Mr. Hoffman to be certain, and received from him a letter confirming the fact: “The term homicide as used in my articles … is strictly limited to deaths from homicide.” He also adds: “I have always stood clearly upon the position that it was immaterial whether the persons killed were white or colored. The Negro’s life economically as well as socially is as valuable and as worthy as that of a white man.” All of which sounds very well and yet Mr. Hoffman has allowed an ambiguous statement to go out under his signature, and he may still be counted as he was when he published that vicious book “Race Traits and Tendencies of the American Negro,”—as one of the most persistent and subtle enemies of the Negro race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMurder (1914)\nMurder (1926)\nCrime (1926)\nThe Old Story (1911)\nDeath Rates (1927)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “Homicides.” The Crisis 23\n(5): 200–201. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/23/05/homicides.html."

We are thinking of these bad effects so persistently since the war that Propaganda is in bad odor. But let us remember that in pitiless Publicity we have perhaps the greatest militant organ of social reform at our hands.\nIn our own problem, the N.A.A.C.P. at the very beginning looked upon The Crisis as a first and absolutely necessary step. Until the best black and white people realized the facts concerning the Negro problem, there was no use discussing remedies. It is as true today as it was then.\nBut further than that, if we want the economic conditions upon which modern life is based to be changed and changed for the better, we need first of all Publicity. The mass of men do not know the facts and there is not today any adequate effort to make all these facts known to the public. Not only that, but law and custom conspire to conceal the truth.\nWhat is the first knowledge which any reformer should have who wishes to improve or rebuild modern industry? It is the facts concerning Income. The income of every human being, far from being a closely guarded secret, should be the most easily ascertainable economic fact. Secondly, the basis of that income should be known. It should be a matter of public knowledge by what work each individual gains his income and the character and extent of this work everybody should know or be able to find out.\nIf the institution of private property is to persist and if it ought to persist, the fundamental fact concerning it should be easily ascertainable; and that is, its exact and precise ownership and whence that ownership came; and if the property is alienated, to whom the ownership is transferred.\nIf individuals must be called upon to support the government, as they certainly must, it should be a matter of public information as to how much each individual contributes toward the public support.\nThese are all simple fundamental facts. Progress, to be sure, has been made in the last few years in making these facts known. It is not too much to say that economic reform has succeeded in so far and only in so far as it was based upon the revelation of such facts. There was a time when a man’s income was considered an absolutely private matter. Today it is at least partially public through the working of the income tax. Tomorrow it will be absolutely public. Today it is only with great difficulty that we can surmise the ownership of anonymous corporations. Tomorrow we will allow no corporation to exist whose ownership and control is not always a matter of accessible public record. Today a man’s occupation is considered his own business. Tomorrow it will be the business and the prime business of each one of his neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Truth (1912)\nRadicals (1919)\nThe Present (1917)\nThe Crisis (1910)\nA Statement (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1922. “Publicity.” The Crisis 24\n(1): 9–10. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/24/01/publicity.html."

The feeling is based on an ancient and fine idea of human Freedom in the quest of Beauty and on a dream that the artist rises and should rise above paltry consideration of dollars and food.\nAt the same time everybody knows that artists must live if their art is to live. Everybody knows that if the people who enjoy the artist’s work do not pay for it, somebody else must or his work cannot go on. Despite this practical, obvious fact, we are united with singular unity to starve colored artists.\nMrs. Meta Warrick Fuller, the sculptor, recently did a beautiful piece of work for a great social movement. She was wretchedly and inadequately paid for it; in fact, it would not be too much to say that she was not paid at all. And the movement congratulated itself upon its economy. Mrs. May Howard Jackson, whose portrait busts are a marvelous contribution to the history of the Negro, in years of work has not received a month’s decent income. Mr. William A. Scott, whose painting is one of the finest things the Negro race has produced in America, has had a desperate struggle to make a living. Richard Brown died of privation while yet a boy.\nOnly in the case of our musicians have we been willing to pay anything like a return for their services, and even in their case we continually complain if they do not give their services for “charity.” We have a few men who are trying to entertain and instruct the public through the writing of books and papers and by carefully prepared lectures. Few buy their books—they borrow them. The men are severely criticized by many because they ask pay for lectures.\nAll this is wrong; it is miserably wrong; it is warning away exactly the type of men who would do more than any others to establish the right of the black race to universal recognition. If work is honorable, then pay is honorable, and what we should be afraid of is not overpaying the artist; it is underpaying and starving and killing him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNegro Art (1921)\nCriteria of Negro Art (1926)\nOrganized Labor (1912)\nMencken (1927)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1922. “Art for Nothing.”\nThe Crisis 24 (1): 8–9. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/24/01/art_for_nothing.html."

As the Negroes have accumulated more means and become more self-assertive, the tendency has been for white givers to reduce their gifts or discontinue their interest entirely, putting many worthy and useful, indeed indispensable, institutions in grave distress.\nThe motives for this withdrawal of help are various: many charitable folk have been left straitened by the war and the new rich have not learned charity. Other folks think that Negroes are now rich enough to help themselves; while not a few others resent the Negroes’ new tone and demands so deeply that they say: Very well, help yourselves and make no more appeals to us!\nThese last two classes are ill-advised. The Negro is still a poor, a very poor group and cannot support the social reform, and eleemosynary work which he needs for social uplift. Moreover his great bond to the rich and powerful has been their charity—if they break this bond they break the last tie that holds him in leash. This may be best in time, but for them is it wise now? Is it wise for white folk to forget that no amount of alms­ giving on their part will half repay the 300 years of unpaid toil and the fifty years of serfdom by which the black man has piled up wealth and comfort for white America?\nIt would be a wiser and more far-sighted attitude today for white America to insist on paying back this debt which they owe to black America as a privilege—as a great peace-offering for wrong—rather than petulantly to vent their spleen on the sick, the degraded and the young for the growing self-assertion of the well, the risen and the old.\nOn our part the way is clear: the sooner we rise above charity, the sooner we shall be free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPhilanthropy and Self Help (1918)\nAn Old Folks’ Home (1915)\nNegro Education (1918)\nSchools (1917)\nInvestments (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1922. “White Charity.” The Crisis\n24 (2): 57. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/24/02/whitecharity.html."

They are going to be punished because an uncivilized community and a brutal judicial system cannot do anything else and be true to its past history and its present constitution. The State of Alabama, together with most of the states of the Southern South, for fifty years has invested in crime. They have used crime for private profit. They have bought and sold criminals. They have built their prosperity and private fortunes upon a treatment of the unfortunate which is contemptible, and in addition to this they have tried through their treatment of Negroes, to satisfy the blood lust of a sadistic people.

    "text": "The full text of his letter and the resolution of the N.A.A.C.P. Board accepting his resignation\nThe Board of Directors of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored people at the June meeting took no action upon the resignation of Dr. Du Bois, tendered as of June 11, but named a committee to confer with Dr. Du Bois and see if some satisfactory settlement of differences could not be arranged.\nUnder date of June 26, however, Dr. Du Bois addressed the following letter to the Board and released it to the press as of July 1, eight days before it came officially to the notice of the Board at its regular meeting July 9:\n\nIn deference to your desire to postpone action on my resignation of June 11, I have allowed my nominal connection with The Crisis to extend to July 1, and have meantime entered into communication with the Chairman of the Board, and with your Committee on Reconciliation.\n\nI appreciate the good will and genuine desire to bridge an awkward break which your action indicated, and yet it is clear to me, and I think to the majority of the Board that under the circumstances my resignation must stand. I owe it, however, to the Board and to the public to make clear at this time the deeper reasons for my action, lest the apparent causes of my resignation seem inadequate.\n\nMany friends have truthfully asserted that the segregation argument was not the main reason for my wishing to leave this organization. It was an occasion and an important occasion, but it could have been adjusted. In fact, no matter what the Board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People says, its action towards segregation has got to approximate, in the future as in the past, the pattern which it followed in the case of the separate camp for Negro officers during the World War and in the case of the Tuskegee Veterans’ Hospital. In both instances, we protested vigorously and to the limit of our ability the segregation policy. Then, when we had failed and we had failed, we bent every effort toward making the colored camp at Des Moines the best officers’ camp possible, and the Tuskegee Hospital, with its Negro personnel, one of the most efficient in the land. This is shown by the 8th and 14th Annual Reports of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\nThe only thing, therefore, that remains for us is to decide whether we are openly to recognize this procedure as inevitable, or be silent about it and still pursue it. Under these circumstances, the argument must be more or less academic, but there is no essential reason that those who see different sides of this same shield should not be able to agree to live together in the same house.\n\nThe whole matter assumed, however, a serious aspect when the Board peremptorily forbade all criticism of the officers and policies in The Crisis. I had planned to continue constructive criticism of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in The Crisis because I firmly believe that the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People faces the most gruelling of tests which come to an old organization: founded in a day when a negative program of protest was imperative and effective, it succeeded so well that the program seemed perfect and unlimited. Suddenly, by World War and chaos, we are called to formulate a positive program of construction and inspiration. We have been thus far unable to comply.\n\nToday this organization, which has been great and effective for nearly a quarter of a century, finds itself in a time of crisis and change, without a program, without effective organization, without executive officers, who have either the ability or disposition to guide the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the right direction.\n\nThese are harsh and arresting charges. I make them deliberately, and after long thought, earnest effort, and with infinite writhing of spirit. To the very best of my ability, and every ounce of my strength, have since the beginning of the Great Depression, tried to work inside the organization for its realignment and readjustment to new duties. I have been almost absolutely unsuccessful. My program for economic readjustment has been totally ignored. My demand for a change in personnel has been considered as mere petty jealousy, and my protest against our mistakes and blunders has been looked upon as disloyalty to the organization.\n\nSo long as I sit by quietly consenting, I share responsibility. If I criticize within, my words fall on deaf ears. If I criticize openly, I seem to be washing dirty linen in public. There is but one recourse, complete and final withdrawal, not because all is hopeless nor because there are no signs of realization of the possibilities of reform and of the imperative demand for men and vision, but because evidently I personally can do nothing more.\n\nI leave behind me in the organization many who have long thought with me, and yet hesitated at action; many persons of large ideals who see no agents at hand to realize them, and who fear that the dearth of ability and will to sacrifice within this organization, indicates a similar lack within the whole race. I know that both sets of friends are wrong, and while I desert them with deep reluctance, it is distinctly in the hope that the fact of my going may arouse to action and bring a great and gifted race to the rescue, with a re-birth of that fine idealism and devotion that founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\nUnder these circumstances, there is but one thing for me to do, and that is to make the supreme sacrifice of taking myself absolutely and unequivocably out of the picture, so that hereafter the leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, without the distraction of personalities and accumulated animosities, can give their whole thought and attention to the rescuing of the greatest organization for the emancipation of Negroes that America has ever had.\n\nI am, therefore, insisting upon my resignation, and on July 1st, whether the Board of Directors acts or does not act, I automatically cease to have any connection whatsoever in any shape or form with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. I do not, however, cease to wish it well, to follow it with personal and palpitating interest, and to applaud it when it is able to rescue itself from its present impossible position and reorganize itself according to the demands of the present crisis.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n(Signed) W. E. B. Du Bois.\n\nAt its meeting July 9, the Board adopted the following resolution:\nRESOLVED, That it is with the deepest regret that we hereby accept the resignation of Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois as editor of The Crisis, as a member of the Board of Directors, as Director of Publications and Research, as a member of the Board of The Crisis Publishing Company, and as a member of the Spingarn Medal Award Committee; and we desire at the same time to record our sense of the loss which his resignation will bring not only to the members of this Board but to every loyal member of the Association.\nDr. Du Bois joined the Association in 1910 as Director of Publications and Research. The Association was then a few months old. He was already a distinguished teacher, scholar and man of letters, Professor of Sociology in Atlanta University, and author of “Souls of Black Folk” and other works which had deeply moved the white world as well as the black. The ideas which he had propounded for a decade were the same ideas that had brought the Association into being.\nHe founded the Crisis without a cent of capital, and for many years made it completely self-supporting, reaching a maximum monthly circulation at the end of the World War of 106,000. This is an unprecedented achievement in American journalism, and in itself worthy of a distinguished tribute. But the ideas which he propounded in it and in his books and essays transformed the Negro world as well as a large portion of the liberal white world, so that the whole problem of the relation of black and white races has ever since had a completely new orientation. He created, what never existed before, a Negro intelligentsia, and many who have never read a word of his writings are his spiritual disciples and descendants. Without him the Association could never have been what it was and is.\nThe Board has not always seen eye to eye with him in regard to various matters, and cannot subscribe to some of his criticism of the Association and its officials. But such differences in the past have in no way interfered with his usefulness, but rather the contrary. For he had been selected because of his independence of judgment, his fearlessness in expressing his convictions, and his acute and wide-reaching intelligence. A mere yes-man could not have attracted the attention of the world, could not even have stimulated the Board itself to further study of various important problems. We shall be the poorer for his loss, in intellectual stimulus, and in searching analysis of the vital problems of the American Negro; no one in the Association can fill his place with the same intellectual grasp. We therefore offer him our sincere thanks for the services he has rendered, and we wish him all happiness in all that he may now undertake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Momentous Proposal (1918)\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Parties (1924)\nA Correspondence (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, National. 1934.\n“Dr. Du Bois Resigns.” The Crisis 41 (8): 245–46.\nhttps://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/41/08/dr_dubois_resigns.html."

    "text": "A certain group of young, American Negroes, inspired by white Radicals, are distinctly looking toward violence as the only method of settling the Negro problems.\nWhen I was speaking in Chicago, recently, a woman of mature age, phrased the argument somewhat heatedly. She said: “Why can’t we fight? What is the difference between our situation and the situation of the English colonies before the Revolution? What is the difference between our plight and that of the slaves in Haiti? Or of the peasants in France before the Revolution?”\nNow the answer to this is almost too obvious to require stating. In 1776, England and her armies were something like six months distant from the Thirteen Colonies. Even if England had had the men to spare for fighting overseas, and she hadn’t, it would have required the transporting of large numbers of men over long periods of time, and at impossible cost, to have beaten the Colonies into submission. They had the forests of the wild West for refuge, and as long as they fought a defensive war, they were invincible.\nAt the time of the Haitian Revolution, there were forty thousand white people on the island, surrounded four hundred and fifty-two thousand blacks, not to mention the twenty-eight thousand mulattoes. In other words, the whites were outnumbered ten to one. To be sure, there were the armies and navies of. France, England and Spain, but there again loomed the difficulty of transportation, the difficulty of co-operation, and the World Wars which were keeping them all busy.\nOn the other hand, here in the United States are twelve million Negroes, totally surrounded by over one hundred and ten million whites. Under such circumstances, to talk about force, is little less than idiotic.\nBut, someone added, could we not induce a large enough number of white people to sympathize with us, so that combining with them, we could gain their rights? The answer to this is simple. We could not. If we could, there would be no need to appeal to force. If the justice of our cause appealed to a majority of white Americans, then our cause would be won by peaceful votes, and pressure of overwhelming public opinion. To such public opinion, we have been appealing for several centuries, and with redoubled and systematic effort, during the last twenty-five years. Our appeal has had some results, but not great results, nor results that give us the slightest reason for thinking that any considerable minority of American white people sympathize with our condition.\nBut the situation is worse than this. Just as soon as Negroes resort to violence or thoughts of violence, they will solidify white opposition. They will give every enemy of the Negro race a chance for using world-wide propaganda to prove that we are enemies of the United States, and of European civilization. With the same tactics that Hitler is using in Germany, they would seek to annihilate, and spiritually, even physically, reinslave the black folk of America. Of this, there is no reasonable doubt, and it is, therefore, our clear policy not to appeal to force until clearly and evidently, there is no other way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRadicals (1919)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nEngland, Again (1920)\nSt. Louis (1916)\nThe Reward (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1934. “Violence.” The Crisis 41\n(5): 147–48. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/41/05/violence.html."

She said: “It seems to me you used to fight Segregation, and that now you are ready to compromise.” I answered: If you mean by fighting Segregation, fighting with fists, this is a thing I have never advocated, because it seems to me that such a policy always loses more than it gains. I have fought Segregation and other evils with reason, with facts, and with agitation. In this way, I’m still fighting. I said in the past that Segregation is wrong. I am still saying it.\nAs to my willingness to compromise, that depends upon what you mean by compromise. If you mean by compromise, taking less than you want, but not wanting less, then I do compromise. I take what I can get, as I always have in the past. Yet I want all. And if in this matter of taking what I can get, I compromise, so do you, and so must you.\nMoreover, and beyond this, I fight Segregation with Segregation, and I do not consider this compromise. I consider it common sense.\nOut beyond me, where I write, lies a slum, Beaver Slide; named after an Atlanta Chief of Police, who went that way hurriedly one night because of certain dark dangers. I have seen this slum now and again for thirty years: Its drab and crowded houses; its mud, dust and unpaved streets; its lack of water, light and sewage; its crowded and unpoliced gloom. Just now, it seems certain, that the United States Government is going to spend $2,000,000 to erase this slum from the face of the earth, and put in its place, beautiful, simple, clean homes, for poor colored people, with all modern conveniences.\nThis is Segregation. It is Segregation by the United States Government. These homes are going to be for Negroes, and only for Negroes; and yet I am a strong advocate for this development. If this is compromise with Segregation; I am compromising. Not only that, but strange enough, I hear no opposition even from the Washington Brain Trust. Dr. George Haynes has uttered no word of protest. The embattled Youth of Washington have not gone on record, and why? Is it because they or I like the necessity of having public development for social uplift divided along an artificial Color Line? Certainly not. But it’s because I have sense enough to know, and I hope they have, that either we get a segregated development here, or we get none at all; and the advantage of decent homes for five thousand colored people, outweighs any disadvantage which will come from this development.\nI say again, if this is compromise; if this is giving up what I have advocated for many years; the change, the reversal, bothers me not at all. But Negro poverty and idleness, and distress, they bother me, and always will.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSegregation (1934)\nHistory of Segregation Philosophy (1934)\nSegregation (1910)\nSegregation in the North (1934)\nThe Strength of Segregation (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1934. “Segregation.” The Crisis 41\n(5): 147. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/41/05/segregation.html."

After the investigators had made their report, Governor Blackwood stated his belief that Norris Dendy had been murdered (not lynched) by persons unknown; and added that the state would endeavor to find and prosecute the criminals.\nIn South Carolina, there is a law by which the family of a man who is lynched is entitled to damages of not less than $2,000. A lynching is death caused by violence committed by an unlawful assembly. When a prisoner in custody is seized through the neglect or connivance of an officer by an unlawful assembly, the officer shall be deposed from office and shall henceforth be ineligible for office unless pardoned. For murder, of course, there is no compensation.\nAfter the two detectives, Richardson and Newman, returned to Columbia, nothing further happened. It is likely that the case would have been dropped had it not been for the determination and perseverance of the brother of the lynched man, Mr. Robert Dendy of New York. Mr. Dendy went to Clinton and endeavored to learn the facts and to arouse interest among the better class white people. He finally obtained an audience for himself and his mother with Governor Blackwood at Columbia which resulted in further gestures on the part of the state investigators. Seeing that this line was accomplishing nothing, he returned to New York. There, after some delay, his attorney, William T. Andrews, obtained an investigator through the N.A.A.C.P. who went to South Carolina in September.\nThe report of this investigator was too voluminous for publication. It included accounts by eye-witnesses of the events at the jail, with the names of many of the participants. One of the leading white citizens stated as a matter of common knowledge that most, if not all, of the police force took part in the lynching. The same person said he had gone to the jail immediately after the lynching and examined the lock on the door of the cell which had been occupied by Norris Denby. He found no sign of the lock having been forced or changed—“it was the same lock that had been there for years.”\nOn the advice of his attorney and of Secretary Walter White of the N.A.A.C.P., Mr. Dendy brought three of the colored witnesses to New York in order that they might testify without personal risk. One of these witnesses, Mr. William Crawford, had already been compelled, by threats of violence by members of the mob, to leave Clinton. The other two were Mr. Ernest Mims, of Washington, D. C., and Miss Clara Belle Peak of Clinton. These three people made affidavits fully describing the events they had witnessed. Their statements, with the other information were sent by Walter White to Governor Blackwood who was urged in the name of the National Association to take immediate action.\nGovernor Blackwood sent Detectives Newman and Cannon to New York where they conferred with Mr. White and Mr. Dendy and arranged for the witnesses to return to South Carolina to testify. There, after a preliminary interview with the Governor they, with Mr. Robert Dendy and his mother, went to Laurens, county seat of Laurens County, with an escort of State highway patrolmen. That this protection was necessary, and that the coroner’s jury was secretly called, is evidence of the tense feeling in the community. The jury was composed of close friends of the men who were named as members of the mob. It met on February 17, 1934.\nIn addition to the three witnesses named above, Mrs. Martha Dendy, mother of Norris and his wife Mrs. Amanda Dendy testified. More than a dozen members of the mob were named, including officers of the law. A sensational surprise was the testimony of a white man, Mr. F. A. Gedeist, that he had seen Norris Dendy taken from the jail by Hubert Pitts and J. Pitts Ray, and placed in an automobile driven by P. M. Pitts.\nMr. William Crawford stated that while in his father’s car, which was parked near the jail, he heard Mrs. Dendy “pleading with Policeman McMillan saying that she would pay the fine if they would only let Norris Dendy out, and Policeman McMillan replied that he could not pay out of this and Pack Pitts reiterated that statement.” Later his affidavit reads, “while deponent was parked at… Pitt and Wall Streets deponent estimated that the crowd he saw in front of the jail consisted of more than one hundred people. That of these he recognized Pack Pitts, Officer Henry Young, Roy Pitts, Marvin Lollis, Hubert Pitts and Chief of Police George Holland; that the conduct of ali of these persons indicated that they were part of what was going on.” He testified further that he saw someone taken from the jail and placed in the automobile belonging to Pack Pitts, who was in the front seat, “and in the back seat was Marvin Lollis and others who were active and deponent could see their arms being raised and going down as if they were beating someone, and deponent heard cries from the back seat.” In the cars following he saw Hubert Pitts and others whose names he does not know but whom he could identify on sight.\nMr. Ernest Mims testified, after a detailed account of Norris Dendy’s efforts to get bail, that he had seen Hubert Pitts get out of his car with a rope and go into the jail; that there were many people around the jail among whom he saw “Red Watkins, Marvin Stewart, Pack Pitts, Roy Pitts, Roy (Bob) Tucker, Gus Blakely, Ray Pitts and L. L. Copeland.” Mr. Mims went into an alley from which he could look through a back door into the jail. He saw “the crowd standing with sticks, brooms and all sorts of weapons and Policeman Weir unlocked the door to Norris’ cell.” He described the struggle which began as the crowd tried to force Norris from his cell. He then went away from that place and shortly after he saw Pack Pitts’ car pass with Norris in the back seat.\nMuch additional and corroborative testimony was given. When it had been heard the jury decided that Norris Dendy had come to his death at the hands of “a party or parties unknown.”\nOn February 19th, murder indictments against five Clinton men were drawn and presented to the grand jury by Solicitor Homer S. Blackwell. They were Marvin Lollis, P. M. Pitts, Hubert Pitts, Roy Pitts and J. Pitts Ray. After considering the case and hearing the witnesses the grand jury adjourned without action. It will meet again in June. Will it then resume the consideration of this case? To date this is just another lynching, with the South running true to form. Another insufferable crime has been committed and the perpetrators are being shielded by the silence and passivity of the “better element.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Moral Void (1917)\nLynching (1927)\nLynching (1926)\nLynching (1928)\nCrime and Lynching (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHelen, Boardman. 1934. “Grand Jury Adjourns: Laurens County Fails\nto Indict Dendy Lynchers.” The Crisis 41 (5): 140. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/41/05/grand_jury_adjourns.html."

    "text": "Race segregation in the United States too often presents itself as an individual problem; a question of my admission to this church or that theater; a question as to whether I shall live and work in Mississippi or New York for my own enjoyment, emolument or convenience. In fact this matter of segregation is a group matter with long historic roots. When Negroes were first brought to America in any numbers, their classification was economic rather than racial. They were in law and custom classed with the laborers, most of whom were brought from Europe under a contract which made them practically serfs. In this laboring class there was at first no segregation, there was some inter-marriage and when the laborer gained his freedom, he became in numbers of cases a landholder and a voter.\nThe first distinction arose between laborers who had come from Europe and contracted to work for a term of years, and laborers from Africa and the West Indies who had made no contract. Both classes were often held for life, but soon there arose a distinction between servants for a term of years and servants for life. Even their admission to a Christian church organization was usually considered as emancipating a servant for life, and thus again the purely racial segregation was cut across by religious considerations.\nFinally, however, slavery became a matter of racial caste, so that white laborers served for definite terms and most black workers served for life. But even here anomaly arose in the case of the small number of Negroes who were free. For a while these free Negroes were not definitely segregated from other free workers, but gradually they were forced together as a caste, holding themselves, on the one hand, strictly away from the slaves, and on the other, being excluded more and more severely from inter-course with whites of all degrees.\nThe result was that there grew up in the minds of the free Negro class a determination and a prejudice which has come down to our day. They fought bitterly with every means at their command against being classed with the mass of slaves. It was for this reason that they objected to being called Negroes. Negroes was synonymous with slaves. They were not slaves. They objected to being coupled with black folk by legislation or custom. Any such act threatened their own freedom. They developed, therefore, both North and South as a separate, isolated group. In large Southern cities, like New Orleans, Savannah and Charleston, they organized their own society, established schools and churches, and made themselves a complete segregated unit, except in their economic relations where they earned a living among the whites as artisans and servants, rising here and there to be semi-professional men and small merchants. The higher they rose and the more definite and effective their organization, the more they protested against being called Negroes or classed with Negroes, because Negroes were slaves.\nIn the North, the development differed somewhat, and yet followed mainly the same lines. The groups of free colored folk in Boston, Newport, New Haven, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Cincinnati, all formed small, carefully organized groups, with their own schools and churches, with their own social life, with their own protest against being classed as Negroes. As the mass of Negroes became free in the Northern states, certain decisions were forced upon these groups. Take for instance, Philadelphia. An event happened in April, 1787, which may be called by the American Negro, the Great Decision. The free colored people of Philadelphia at that time were making a desperate fight for recognition and decent social treatment.\nTwo of their leaders, Richard Allen and Absalom Jones, had proffered their services during the terrible epidemic in 1792, and partly at their own expense, helped bury the deserted dead of the white folk. The Mayor properly commended them. Both these men worshipped at St. George’s Methodist Church, then at 4th and Vine Streets. For years they had been made welcome; but as gradual emancipation progressed in Pennsylvania, Negroes began to pour in to the city from the surrounding country, and black Christians became too numerous at St. George’s. One Sunday morning during prayer, Jones and Allen were on their knees, when they were told they must get up and go to the gallery where hereafter black folk would worship. They refused to stir until the prayer was over, and then they got up and left the church. They never went back.\nUnder these circumstances, what would you have done, Dear Reader of 1934? There were several possibilities. You might have been able to impress it upon the authorities of the church that you were not like other Negroes; that you were different, with more wealth and intelligence, and that while it might be quite all right and even agreeable to you that other Negroes should be sent to the gallery, that you as an old and tried member of the church should be allowed to worship as you pleased. If you had said this, it probably would have had no effect upon the deacons of St. George’s.\nIn that case, what would you have done? You could walk out of the church but whither would you walk? There were no other white churches that wanted you. Most of them would not have allowed you to cross their threshold. The others would have segregated you in the gallery or at a separate service. You might have said with full right and reason that the action of St. George’s was un-Christian and despicable, and dangerous for the future of democracy in Philadelphia and in the United States. That was all quite true, and nevertheless its statement had absolutely no effect upon St. George’s.\nWalking out of this church, these two men formed an organization. It was called the Free African Society. Virtually it was confined to a colored membership, although some of the Quakers visited the meetings from time to time and gave advice. Probably there was some discussion of taking the group into the fellowship of the Quakers, but liberal as the Quakers were, they were not looking for Negro proselytes. They had had a few in the West Indies but not in the United States. The excluded Negroes found themselves in a dilemma. They could do one of two things: They could ask to be admitted as a segregated group in some white organization; or they could form their own organization. It was an historic decision and they did both.\nRichard Allen formed from the larger part of the group, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which today has 750,000 members and is without doubt the most powerful single Negro organization in the United States. Absalom Jones formed St. Thomas Church as a separate Negro church in the Episcopal communion, and the church has had a continuous existence down to our day.\nWhich of these two methods was best will be a matter of debate. There are those who think that it was saving something of principle to remain in a white church, even as a segregated body. There are others who say that this action was simply a compromise with the devil and that having been kicked out of the Methodist Church and not allowed equality in the Episcopal Church, there was nothing for a self-respecting man to do but to establish a church of his own.\nNo matter which solution seems to you wisest, segregation was compulsory, and the only answer to it was internal self-organization; and the answer that was inevitable in 1787, is just an inevitable in 1934.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSegregation in the North (1934)\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Race Segregation (1934)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nSegregation (1934)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1934. “History of Segregation Philosophy.”\nThe Crisis 41 (3): 85–86. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/41/03/history_of_segregation_philosophy.html."

    "text": "The difficulty with the modern wage contract is that the contracting parties, the worker and the employer, do not meet with equal power to negotiate. The wage earner must accept in most cases any wage offer because otherwise he will starve to death; and since the employer’s profit depends on the amount that he can save from wages, he is tempted to reduce the wage as nearly as possible to the bare necessities for keeping the worker alive.\nTo attack this difficulty there have been many proposals, like minimum wage laws, the distribution of capital among workers and other socialistic and communistic experiments.\nBut one of the most feasible remedies is to make it possible for the worker to support himself with food and shelter even if temporarily he is out of employment or holding out for higher wage. The one method of accomplishing this is by small homesteads where the worker and his family by extra and healthful outdoor work can raise his own food.\nIt is a fine project and deserves all success; but like everything in the United States, it brings up the Negro problem. Such homesteads might be bought anywhere in connection with the present distribution of industry; but it would be cheapest and on the whole most feasible, if they were established in colonies, and this immediately brings up the question: Who shall be selected for these colonies?\nWe can yell our heads off and pass the bravest and most uncompromising resolutions and yet we know that most homestead colonies, and particularly those in the South, are not going to select any Negro participants, except as servants and casual laborers.\nIt would be fine if people were selected without regard to color, but in the United States this is simply impossible. The color of a man’s skin in a colony of this sort would mean more to the colony than any other characteristic. His integrity, his ability, his industry, his personal characteristics, would count for nothing, as set in all against the fact that he was of Negro descent.\nSo far then as these colonies are voluntary associations or incorporated bodies, the Negro would be given no chance to enter on equal terms with the whites. For the most part in the South he would be deprived of political rights; he would have to have separate social institutions, such as schools and churches, and his economic opportunities in various ways would be curtailed. Under these circumstances, it would be nothing less than idiotic for colored people themselves to refuse to accept or neglect to ask for subsistence homestead colonies of their own. They would have a chance to select the character of people with whom they wanted to live; they would have a chance of making these settlements model settlements of which anybody would be proud, and they would do more in the long run to break down the Color Line than they could by any futile and helpless denunciation of race prejudice. It seems almost impossible that honest, clear-thinking American Negroes can not see this patent fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro and Labor (1922)\nOrganized Labor (1912)\nThe Simple Way (1913)\nEugene Debs (1926)\nThe Flood, the Red Cross and the National Guard (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1934. “Subsistence Homestead Colonies.”\nThe Crisis 41 (3): 85. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/41/03/Subsistence_homestead_colonies.html."

According to their statement: “John Brown, a Connecticut abolitionist, with a criminal record behind him,” planned a raid to free the slaves, but “not a single slave joined the conspirators.” A boulder was accordingly put in place and dedicated and at its dedication, to the surprise of the colored world, Henry T. McDonald, the white President of colored Storer College, and the Reverend George F. Bragg, Jr., colored rector of the St. James Episcopal Church, Baltimore, took part.\nDuring the exercises, white speakers condemned the Haitian Revolution, lauded the “black mammy,” and called John Brown crazy. It was a pro-slavery celebration and most, people will agree with the Editor of the Afro-American that it was disgraceful for the President of Storer College and Dr. Bragg to have any part in this travesty.\nThe boulder is ostensibly erected to the memory of a free Negro who was killed in the fight, and the inscription says:\n\nThis boulder is erected by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy as a memorial to Heyward Shepherd, exemplifying the character and faithfulness of thousands of Negroes who, under many temptations throughout subsequent years of war, so conducted themselves that no stain was left upon a record which is the peculiar heritage of the American people, and an everlasting tribute to the best in both races.\n\nThe statement that no slave helped and fought with John Brown is historically incorrect and one is glad to remember that nearly two hundred thousand Negroes yielded to the “temptation” to fight against slavery in the Civil War and that most of them were former slaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAn Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson (1913)\nThe Election (1912)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nThe Flag (1911)\nMr. Taft (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1932. “John Brown.” The Crisis 39\n(1): 467. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/39/01/john_brown.html."

    "text": "The Editor of the Louisiana Weekly writes:\n\nI shall appreciate very much a letter from you encouraging the young colored men of our city to increase their interest in politics. The older men have discouraged them and refused to act with them because of envy. A letter from you to the young men, urging them to carry on in spite of this selfish handicap, would go a long way toward kindling hope anew.\n\nThe situation of an intelligent, young colored man who wants to use his right to vote effectively in the South is exceedingly difficult. He is not admitted to the Democratic Party, and can not easily take part in their white primary. This is still true despite the continued efforts of the N.A.A.C.P. to stop it, and thus to break up one party government in the South.\nOn the other hand, the Republican Party in the South is not a party; it is mainly a group of selfish men, white and black, who are using the party organization for personal gain. Sometimes, under strong and honest leaders, like Cuney of Texas or Cohen of Louisiana, this group may be strengthened and organized so as to exercise some real political power. But when this group falls into the hands of mediocre self-seekers, or into the hands of local white politicians who use it simply for personal aggrandisement or who are in secret alliance with the Democratic Party, then the situation of the young and honest Negro voter is indeed difficult.\nNevertheless, there are certain clear lines of effort. First of all, the Negro must register and fight continually for the right of registration. The situation in Louisiana in this respect is disgraceful and the Negroes of Louisiana ought literally to pound the courts with cases until they get the right to register. One or two thoroughly arranged cases before the Supreme Court of the United States would show that of 415,000 Negroes in Louisiana in 1930, 21 years of age and over, less than 3,000 are registered, and this in spite of the fact that nearly 300,000 can read and write.\nAll Negroes who register should vote. First, they should seek to vote in the Democratic primary as this is the only voting that really counts. If they are denied this right, they should be especially careful to vote in those elections where the primary cannot function, as, for instance, in bond elections, and various referenda. In all bond issues, they should vote “no,” unless they are able to get a categorical promise concerning the use of the money to be raised. They should especially vote for local officials and on local issues whenever and wherever they get a chance, and they should form political organizations with the specific object of equalizing taxation, stopping discrimination in civil life and stopping discrimination in appropriations for streets, schools and parks; increasing efforts in sanitation, and getting rid of venal and prejudiced public officials.\nThey should write strong letters of protest, regularly and often to the papers, to the Congressmen, and to the President of the United States. They should thus build up an active and interested political life and back it by just as many votes as they are able to cast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVoting (1910)\nHow Shall We Vote (1920)\nVote (1924)\nThe Woman Voter (1921)\nThe Negro Party (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1932. “Young Voters.” The Crisis\n39 (9): 298. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/39/09/young_voters.html."

Never since Emancipation and the bargain of 1876, was a more dangerous attack made on the right of Negroes to vote. The protest said:\n\nWe are asking in this appeal, for a public repudiation of this campaign of racial hatred. Silence and whispering in this case are worse than in matters of personal character and religion. Will white America make no protest? Will the candidates continue to remain silent? Will the Church say nothing? Is there in truth any issue in this campaign, either religious tolerance, liquor, water-power, tariff or farm relief, that touches in weight the transcendant and fundamental question of the open, loyal and unchallenged recognition of the essential humanity of twelve million Americans who happen to be dark-skinned?\n\nTo this national protest, Herbert Hoover did not answer a single word. On the contrary, his “Lily-White” policy continued the campaign.\nNominations for Office Mr. Hoover’s persistence in this attitude was further proven by his willingness to appoint to public office known enemies of the Negro race. In the face of wide protest and plain facts, he appointed William N. Doak as Secretary of Labor, knowing that Doak was the head of a trade union which specifically excludes Negroes, and that for years he was active in West Virginia in depriving Negroes of the right to work, especially on the railways. The recent systematic campaign against Negro firemen in the South is a movement in the same direction and resulted last year alone in seven Negro firemen killed and fourteen seriously injured by their white fellow workers.\nMr. Hoover nominated as Justice of the United States Supreme Court John J. Parker of North Carolina, in spite of the fact that Parker had opposed the right of Negroes to vote. We have been told that Parker was willing to repudiate this stand but that the White House refused to let him; at any rate, while Mr. Hoover hastened to explain Parker’s labor decisions, he treated his anti-Negro attitude with disdainful silence and despite advice and pleading, insisted upon sending this nomination to the Senate. It was finally defeated by a narrow margin by the influence of the Negro and labor vote and despite every effort of the administration to force it through."

    "text": "The Negro and the Nation\nIt may be said that the above arraignment, even if true, is partial and one-sided, in that it judges the acts of a public official elected to serve 123 million people from the point of view of the special interests and desires of 12 million.\nIf the demands of 12 million colored Americans were antagonistic to those of their 111 million fellows, there would remain a grave question of duty and sacrifice and a nice dilemma as to how far a nation can ask a tenth of its souls to commit suicide.\nBut we Negroes contend that our problem is but a microcosm of the nation and that the president who fails us fails all.\nTake the great national problems: the Depression of Industry; the International Debts; the Tariff. In all these, President Hoover has been either wrong or helplessly inadequate and each of these failures affects us.\nStubbornly and blindly, the President for three years denied that there was any depression; allowed the figures of unemployment to be falsified, and refused to sanction adequate and thorough-going relief. When he was forced to face relief, he went to the rescue of banks, railroads and corporations. Yet, we Negroes were the first and severest sufferers from depression and the last to be relieved.\nThe world owes this nation a fantastic sum which it cannot pay and never will. It is arming for war as fast as it can. Here Mr. Hoover’s leadership is vacillating and contradictory. He calls for a temporary moratorium and then refuses to discuss the problems it raises. He evolves a formula for peace which makes others disarm and allows us to increase armament. He demands that the League of Nations rule in Manchuria but not in Liberia. He wants treaties observed by Japan in China and not by the United States in Haiti. As a result, Peace, industry, and international good will suffer. America becomes the best-hated nation on earth. No one credits her with either good sense or good contentions, and yet all must dance attendance on her organized and despotic economic power. And this economic power crushes Negro labor at home, just as it retards European recovery abroad.\nAs a manufacturing nation, we need to sell goods all over the earth. We can only sell to those who can pay. Nations pay for imports with exports. Herbert Hoover signed a bill which taxed imports so highly that nations cannot afford to buy our goods. Hoover knew the rates were too high, yet he signed the bill. Our exports decline, our factories close and we starve. And we Negroes starve first and longest.\nMoreover, we cannot as a nation secure control of industry and politics as long as the rotten boroughs of the South, with political power based on disfranchised black and white labor, make a third party movement impossible. No one in our day has helped disfranchisement and race hatred more than Herbert Hoover by his “Lily-White” policy, his appointments to office, and his failure to recognize or appreciate the plight of the Forgotten Black Man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Election (1928)\nThe Election (1912)\nThe Republican Party (1918)\nMr. Taft (1911)\nThe Campaign of 1928 (1928)"

    "text": "There was held in December in Washington a “Non-Partisan Negro Conference” called by Congressman Oscar De Priest. It brought together speakers of all sorts and kinds, and speeches good, bad and indifferent. The general spirit, however, seemed excellent and the independence of thought, knowledge of subjects discussed and general morale were commendable.\nI was invited to discuss “The Economic Condition of the Negro.” When I had finished, the Chairman of the Committee on Findings, Kelly Miller, asked me if I had prepared an “economic plank.” I replied that I had not known I was expected to, but that I would gladly write one, even then, if I could have a stenographer. No stenographer was forthcoming, so I returned to New York and early next morning dispatched a proposed plank by air mail, offering at the same time by telegram to send the plank by wire if necessary. I had no reply.\nBelow in parallel columns are my proposed plank and the planks actually adopted."

In the modified language of Frederick Douglas, “The Constitution is the ship, all else is the sea.”\n\nA. In this day of deep depression and unemployment, of which the Negro sustains the heaviest brunt, we urge Our people everywhere to be thrifty, frugal and industrious, reliable and dutiful in the performance of any task which their hands may find to do.\n\nB. We urge the white labor world, feeling the effect of the common depression, to lay aside their customary intolerance against their Negro laborers and fellow-workers, and to evince a willingness to share with him the limited opportunities, rather than strive to exclude him on the ungenerous plea, “les there be not enough for you and us.”\n\nC. We urge the capitalists and masters of industry to apportion fairly among black and white workers alike, both work and pay in this dark day of industrial uncertainty."

It should have been the key plank of the conference, adopted after thought, research and long discussion. And it should have expressed the real and only reason this conference had for being: the relation of the ballot to work and wages.\nThe plank which I proposed was my own sincere thought, but I had no silly pride of authorship and I was sure it would be too strong medicine for some of the queasy stomachs present.\nBut in the name of a Merciful Heaven, why O why! did it seem necessary even to the jaded digestive system of Kelly Miller to feed the race on this one subject and at its hungriest moment, the thinnest economic flap-doodle?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro Politician (1928)\nThe Election (1928)\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Parties (1924)\nThe Campaign of 1928 (1928)\nToward a New Racial Philosophy (1933)"

    "text": "We trust that none of the friends of Negro education will be disconcerted at the smoke-screen now being industriously spread over the situation at Howard University. Despite widespread and anonymous accusations printed in the Negro and white press, neither the ability nor integrity of the president of Howard University is at all in question. The real question is the conduct of the office of the secretary-treasurer and the plans of the Washington Real Estate Trust. Despite three years’ effort, Dr. Mordecai Johnson has not been able to get a modern budget system established at Howard University. His every effort in this line has been balked and sabotaged, and it is as true today as it was when he came to the presidency, that, the trustees do not know and do not attempt to find out just what the income of Howard University is, and exactly how it is spent.\nNo president, with his hands thus tied, can succeed. When, in addition to that, the white real estate interests of Washington, together with their colored tools, attempt to force the executive to buy factory sites and apartment houses out of funds appropriated by the General Education Board for other areas, the situation becomes a crying shame and calls for reform. It is natural, then, that the rats in the hulk of this great vessel should scamper to cover and endeavor to make the public believe that the trouble at Howard centers in the question of a young engineer’s appointment or some petty official’s dismissal. The real center is the question as to whether the secretary-treasurer can be forced to install a modern budget system or to let someone else install it who has the will and ability; and the further question, as to the purging out of the present Board of Trustees certain white elements whom the highest officials of the District of Columbia know to be untrustworthy and dishonest.\n\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1932. “Again Howard.” The Crisis. 39(4):131.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHoward (1928)\nThe Negro College (1933)\nCredit (1915)\nNegro Education (1918)\nSchools (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1932. “Again Howard.” The Crisis\n39 (4): 131. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/39/04/again_howard.html."

    "text": "It is to the disgrace of the American Negro, and particularly of his religious and philanthropic organizations, that they continually and systematically neglect Negroes who have been arrested, or who are accused of crime, or who have been convicted and incarcerated.\nOne can easily realize the reason for this: ever since Emancipation and even before, accused and taunted with being criminals, the emancipated and rising Negro has tried desperately to disassociate himself from his own criminal class. He has been all too eager to class criminals as outcasts, and to condemn every Negro who has the misfortune to be arrested or accused. He has joined with the bloodhounds in anathematizing every Negro in jail, and has called High Heaven to witness that he has absolutely no sympathy and no known connection with any black man who has committed crime.\nAll this, of course, is arrant nonsense; is a combination of ignorance and pharisaism which ought to put twelve million people to shame. There is absolutely no scientific proof, statistical, social or physical, to show that the American Negro is any more criminal than other elements in the American nation, if indeed as criminal. Moreover, even if he were, what is crime but disease, social or physical? In addition to this, every Negro knows that a frightful proportion of Negroes accused of crime are absolutely innocent. Nothing in the world is easier in the United States than to accuse a black man of crime. In the South, if any crime is committed, the first cry of the mob is, “Find the Negro!” And while they are finding him, the white criminal comfortably escapes. Nothing is easier, South and North, than for a white man to black his face, saddle a felony upon the Negro, and then go wash his body and his soul. Today, if a Negro is accused, whether he is innocent or guilty, he not only is almost certain of conviction, but of getting the limit of the law. What else is the meaning of the extraordinary fact that throughout the United States the number of Negroes hanged, sentenced for life, or for ten, twenty or forty years, is an amazingly large proportion of the total number?\nMeantime, what are we doing about it? Here and there, in a few spectacular cases, we are defending persons, where race discrimination is apparent, and where the poor devil of a victim manages to get into the newspaper. But in most cases, the whole black world is dumb and acquiescent; they will not even visit the detention houses where the accused, innocent and guilty, are herded like cattle. They make few systematic attempts to reform the juvenile delinquent who may be guilty of nothing more than energy and mischief. Only in sporadic cases do we visit the jails and hear the tales of the damned.\nFor a race which boasts its Christianity, and for a Church which squanders its money upon carpets, organs, stained glass, bricks and stone, this attitude toward Negro crime is the most damning accusation yet made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCrime (1920)\nThe Old Story (1911)\nLogic (1914)\nAnarchism (1912)\nCrime (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1932. “Courts and Jails.”\nThe Crisis 39 (4): 132. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/39/04/courts_and_jails.html."

    "text": "Juliette Derriocotte was fatally injured in Dalton, Georgia. Dalton is the county seat of Whitfield County and is forty miles southeast of Chattanooga. It had in 1930 a population of 8,160, of which 1,028 were Negroes. There were among the whites, 2840 ten years of age in 1920 who were illiterate, and among the Negroes, 120. Dalton is a shipping point for cotton, cattle, grain and fruit, and has cotton mills with 976 looms and 94,000 spindles. It has canning factories, flour mills, foundries and machine shops. It was founded in 1848 and incorporated in 1874 and was the scene of some fighting when Bragg retreated there from Chattanooga in 1863. It is, of course, a religious town. There are 5 white churches and 6 Negro. It figured for a time as a health resort; it is the seat of Dalton Female College. There are public schools and weekly newspapers and a national bank.\nIn particular, for our purpose, there is the Hamilton Memorial Hospital, with a complete modern equipment, supported by public taxation.\nMiss Derricotte, with three other passengers, was traveling to her home in Athens, Ga., to settle certain business matters for her family. She had with her Nina Johnson, a senior at Fisk, Edward Davis, a student who lives in Athens, and Marian Price, another student who lives in Atlanta. They were traveling by automobile in order to avoid the “Jim-crow” cars of the South, and the difficulty in getting meals and other transportation.\n\nWe left Chattanooga about three o’clock. Miss Derricotte was driving. I was in the front seat with her; Miss. Johnson and Miss Price were in the rumble seat. We had been driving along at a fair rate of speed and were about a mile and a half out of Dalton. I was talking to Miss Johnson and Miss Price when I suddenly turned around and noticed another car very close to us. A second later the two cars hit each other. Miss Derricotte snatched the steering wheel to the right, turned it loose and called to me. When I reached for the steering wheel the car was beginning to turn and by the time I got hold of it the car was turning over. I then turned the wheel loose and threw up my hands in an effort to save myself. The last I remember then was hearing the crash.\n\nThe next thing I remember, I was lying in a field. Miss Derricotte was lying near me groaning.\n\nThere immediately began a series of investigations. Mrs. Ethel B. Gilbert, an official at Fisk University, heard of the accident, telephoned and rushed to Chattanooga. Thence, she wrote various private letters. Other officials came from Fisk University, including Dr. Elmer S. Imes and Warner Lawson. The President of Fisk University later began an investigation; the Secretary of the N.A.A.C.P. stopped in Chattanooga and inquired into the facts; finally, the Commission on Interracial Co-operation of Atlanta made an investigation “at the request of Fisk University and other organizations interested in ascertaining the facts of the situation.” After that, the participants in the accident were requested to make no further statements and the Y.W.C.A., so far as we know, did nothing.\nLet us compare now, the report of the Inter-racial Commission and statements from other sources. First, as to what happened directly after the accident:\n\n\n\n\nInter-Racial Commission\n\n\nOther Reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mr. and Mrs. Helton, unhurt, climbed out through the broken windshield of their car and went immediately to Miss Derricotte’s car… Mr. Helton stated that he hurried someone off to call for an ambulance.\n\n\n About this time a white man dressed in overalls came up and asked me what I was going to do about his car. I asked what was the matter with his car. He told me it was his car we had hit. I told him I would have to wait until we had received medical attention. I did not see him any more.  ~Davis.\n\n\n\n\n No ambulance came.\n\n\n I then began to make appeals for help from the people standing around. One man informed me that they had already sent for an ambulance.  ~Davis. \n\n\n\n\n Mrs. Gordon Mann White, who lives nearby, and at the time of the collision was between her home and the highway, saw the collision and ran immediately for her car.  Mrs. Mann, who brought Miss Johnson in, stated that she inquired where Negroes could get treatment, and was told to go to a doctor’s office, which she did.  Miss Johnson was taken to the office of Dr. J Steed, a physician with a record of many years’ service in Dalton. Miss Derricotte was taken to the office of Dr. O. E. Shellhorse. Miss Price and Mr. Davis were taken to the office of Dr. G Broaderick These three doctors, all white, have offices within two blocks of each other on King street.  Dr. Steed states that Miss Johnson was unconscious when brought to his office and never regained consciousness, and it was evident from the first that she was seriously wounded.\n\n\n The man took us into Dalton. We were near the center of the town when he asked a number of people where the hospital was. A few did not know; others said there was no hospital for Negroes; and others said they would have to take us to some doctor’s home. He drove on farther and asked a white boy about a hospital or a doctor. The boy told us his father was a doctor and lived right up the street. He took us to his home. This doctor’s name was Dr. Broaderick.  ~Davis.\n\n\n\n\n Miss Derricotte was taken to Dr. O. E. Shellhorse’s office and placed on his operating table. She was in a semi-conscious condition, being in possession of her faculties a part of the time, and indicating that she had severe pains in her chest and hip. Dr. Shellhorse states that he examined her thoroughly, saw the seriousness of her condition and called in for consultation Dr. Ault.\n\n\n By this time Miriam was able to call in to Chattanooga to Mr. Trimble’s home, and he told her that he was sending an ambulance down as soon as he could. We asked Dr. Broaderick to send his son to get some information about Miss Derricotte and Miss Johnson, which he did. The son reported that they had been taken from Dr. Steed’s to a colored sanitorium.  ~Davis.\n\n\n\n\n When Miss Derricotte had been treated by Dr. Shellhorse, he called the local Negro undertaker, Mr. Johnson, and asked him to build a fire and prepare a room for Miss Derricotte in the home of Mrs. Alice Wilson, colored, 3 Emory Street.  The physicians of Dalton have been taking patients to Mrs. Wilson’s home for a number of years, and major operations have been successfully performed there. Mrs. Wilson is without formal training or professional standing.\n\n\n The house was in very bad order and there was no evidence of facilities for handling such cases as this there. The bed which Mrs. Wilson vacated to answer our knock was the bed in which Miss Derricotte or Miss Johnson had lain for five or six hours. It was a very uncomfortable looking and not very clean folding bed.  ~Dr. Imes. \n\n\n\n\n Shortly after six o’clock when Miss Price had been treated, Dr. Broaderick’s son called the Trimble home in Chattanooga, where Miss Derricotte and the three Fisk students had lunched in the early afternoon, and Miss Price told of the accident and asked that an ambulance be sent. Miss Price also made calls to Fisk University informing people there of the accident.\n\n\n I have found out that they were removed to the “house where Negroes are sent in emergencies.” The three men visited that house, were met at the door by an ugly, barefooted woman who showed them the folding beds where the two seriously injured ones had been put. If anybody makes a report that says in effect “everything that could be done was done,” it merely means that everything that could be done for Negroes was done.  ~Mrs. Gilbert. \n\n\n\n\n Upon arrival at the Wilson home, Miss Derricotte and Miss Johnson were placed on a bed and a couch respectively, and Doctors Wood and Shellhorse came to see them shortly.\n\n\n The whole impression of this house was one of disorder and dirt which the owner explained by saying that she had only returned after seven months’ absence. It was sickening and heartbreaking to us to think of Miss Derricotte and Miss Johnson having been allowed to lie there and suffer for five long hours in their critical condition, denied the care and medical treatment that might have possibly saved both lives. ~Warner Lawson. \n\n\n\n\n Miss Price asked Dr. Shellhorse, according to Dr. Shellhorse’s statements, if Miss Derricotte could be moved to Chattanooga. He advised against this in the presence of one of the men from Chattanooga who had come with the Trimble car and ambulance, and there was an understanding that Miss Derricotte would remain at the Wilson home.  Dr. Shellhorse, upon leaving the Wilson home, gave instructions to Mrs. Wilson and asked her to call him if Miss Derricotte got worse, saying he would come back early next morning if he had no call in the meantime. When he went to the Wilson home early next morning he was surprised to find that Miss Derricotte had been taken to Chattanooga.  Without regaining consciousness, Miss Johnson was placed in the ambulance upon its return and died before reaching Chattanooga. Miss Derricotte, who was placed at the Walden Hospital in Chattanooga, died about six o’clock the following evening (Saturday, November 7).\n\n\n We were taken around to the colored sanitarium, which proved to be a very dirty home. We found Nina and Miss Derricotte in separate beds close to each other. There were no doctors there when we arrived. Nina was unconscious. Miss Derricotte was conscious and rather hysterical. Miriam left me to quiet Miss Derricotte as much as possible while she went to telephone their parents and to put in a call for their local doctor. About half an hour later a white doctor came in and attended to Nina; while he was there Mr. Trimble and Dr. Patton of Chattanooga came. A little later Dr. Steed came in. About eleven o’clock it was decided to move Miss Derricotte to Chattanooga in the ambulance. They started off very slowly. Nina was put in another ambulance. Miriam and I and were put in Mr. Trimble’s private car and came in behind the ambulance. Miriam was taken to the Trimble home and I was taken to the Walden Hospital. Miss Derricotte was also taken to the Walden Hospital. I was given treatment and the next morning Mrs. Gilbert informed me that Nina had passed away during the night. Saturday afternoon I was told that Miss Derricotte was dead.” ~Davis. \n\n\n\n\n Miss Duke, resident nurse in charge of the Hamilton Memorial Hospital, stated that no one of the Negroes in the accident had been brought there. When asked whether Miss Derricotte and Miss Johnson would have been treated had they been brought to the Hamilton Memorial Hospital, Miss Duke hesitated and said: “I do not see that we could have done otherwise.” She stated that there are no precedents for the answer to this question, in that no Negro had ever been brought to the hospital for care, stating that it was generally understood that Negroes were not treated there.\n\n\nI: How soon was she removed to the house where Negro patients are taken? Dr. Steed: Just as soon as first aid was administered. I: To your knowledge, was any attempt made by anyone to get them into Hamilton Memorial Hospital? Dr. Steed: Oh, no’m. We don’t take ’em there. I: But knowing the seriousness of this particular case, did no one attempt to get them in in spite of the usual procedure? Dr. Steed: Oh, no, m’a’m, You see, we don’t even have any wards for them there.  ~Mrs. Gilbert. \n\n\n\n\n Doctors Shellhorse, Steed and Broaderick stated that a colored ward was needed at the Hamilton Memorial Hospital and that some work had been done to that end during the past two years.\n\n\n I asked Dr. Shellhorse the same question, and he told me that she (Miss Derricotte) was there an hour and a half before she was removed to the home. I asked him if he believed at the time that she was fatally iniured and he replied: “Why, yes. I was sure she was going to die.” I asked him what he would say the cause of the death would be and he replied a severe shock. He also said in answer to my question in regard to an attempt to get them into the hospital, “No, not that I know of.” ~Mrs. Gilbert.\n\n\n\n\nIt must be remembered that the reports by Mrs. Gilbert, Edward Davis, Dr. Imes and Warner Lawson, were made on the spot within a few hours after the accident. While, on the other hand, the report of the Inter-Racial Commission was made some time after and with at best the unconscious purpose of making out a case for the South.\nThere remain, naturally, irreconcilable discrepancies. The story that emerges is that very soon after the accident and at the appeal of Davis, white neighbors rushed the wounded persons to town. That the man who ran into them, at first demanded compensation for his car, and then disappeared. That in town, neither white nor colored people knew at first what to do but at last it was agreed that the patients must be taken to physicians’ offices. The physicians gave them attention for an hour and a half. They knew that two of them were desperately injured and needed the utmost care. Miss Johnson’s pulse was 150 and Miss Derricotte was alternately hysterical and unconscious. Nevertheless, they had them transported to a house with no hospital facilities and left them there without professional attendance for several hours; finally, the Chattanooga ambulance arrived and took them away.\n The George W. Hamilton Memorial Hospital, supported by public taxation, at Dalton, Georgia, to which no Negro citizen may be admitted.\nIn the light of this, what shall be said of the civilization of Dalton, Ga? We can say this best in the words of Mrs. Ethel Gilbert. She had long been connected with Negro education in the South and came to Dalton and Chattanooga immediately after the accident. She reported her facts and feelings in a private letter to a friend, which we venture to quote, without permission. Her words are so true and fair that they make a human document which must not be suppressed. She says:\n\nI am nearly crazy. Juliette was dearer to me than almost any woman alive. I took that ride from Dalton to Chattanooga in the night, dressed in a woolen dress with a fur coat on and was chilled clear through from shock and anxiety. The road had a long detour, about fifteen miles, I should say, of rough dirt road. It is impossible to think of the horror of so severely injured a person being jolted over those roads after her hours of agony in Dalton. I shall always have to compare in my mind all of the things that were done that would not have been done to me if I had been injured. I shall always have to remember that, within one-half hour after the accident, I would have been in a modern hospital. I shall always have to think of Juliette dying in a place that could not be dignified by the name of a hospital except that the beds were a few inches higher than the beds would have been in a boarding house and that they had a few bed pans. All of the people in that little place were kindness and courtesy itself, but that does not take the place of the clean walls, the soft-footed, sure-fingered nurses, the well-equipped operating room, the comfortable bed, the shaded lights, the efficient doctors, that I had when I was taken into a hospital for an emergency operation.\n\nI feel very strongly that this incident should be used in some way, preferably in the way Juliette would like best, to help this whole rotten situation down here. She was loved by a great many people who might pay attention to an injury to her who would not be deeply concerned if just anybody were involved. I wish that the Y.W.C.A. or some liberal magazine in New York could make an investigation and put material in all of our hands that could be used as widely as possible. And while we are doing it, I hope we will all remember that the whole system is rotten and wicked and unspeakably cruel, not simply because it operated to harm someone whom we love very much but because it would harm any poor ignorant, wicked, unfortunate victim of an accident if he happened to be a Negro. I think that is the approach Juliette would want to have made. If there is anything under heaven that I can do to help in any way, let me do it.\n\nI have been uneasy and unhappy in this situation for four years. No one understood my position better than Juliette did. From now on it will be increasingly difficult to bear at all. It makes being white about the hardest thing one has to put up with in a very sorry section of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Burning of Jim Mc Ilherron: An N.A.A.C.P.

    "text": "The relation of the church to the Negro is, or should be, a very simple proposition. Leaving aside the supernatural significance of the church organization, we have here groups of people working for human uplift and professing the highest and most unselfish morality as exemplified by the life and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth and the Golden Rule.\nBy this standard all church members should treat Negroes as they themselves would wish to be treated if they were colored. They should do this and teach this and, if need be, die for this creed.\nThe plain facts are sadly at variance with this doctrine. The church aided and abetted the Negro slave trade; the church was the bulwark of American slavery; and the church to-day is the strongest seat of racial and color prejudice. If one hundred of the best and purest colored folk of the United States should seek to apply for membership in any white church in this land tomorrow, 999 out of every 1,000 ministers would lie to keep them out. They would not only do this, but would openly and brazenly defend their action as worthy of followers of Jesus Christ.\nYet Jesus Christ was a laborer and black men are laborers; He was poor and we are poor; He was despised of his fellow men and we are despised; He was persecuted and crucified, and we are mobbed and lynched. If Jesus Christ came to America He would associate with Negroes and Italians and working people; He would eat and pray with them, and He would seldom see the interior of the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine.\nWhy then are His so-called followers deaf, dumb and blind on the Negro Problem — on the human problem?\nBecause they think they have discovered bypaths to righteousness which do not lead to brotherhood with the poor, the dirty, the ignorant and the black. “Make them servants.” they say; “we need cooks.” But can a whole race be doomed to menial service in a civilization where menial service is itself doomed? And when menial service has become Service and lost its social stigma, so that white folk want to enter such service, will they welcome black folk as fellow servants? Certainly not; and thus the slavery argument of this cry stands revealed.\n“But,” cry others, “let the Negroes themselves bear their own social responsibilities for poverty, ignorance and disease. Segregate them and pile their sins upon them.” Indeed! Are the poor alone responsible for poverty? And the ignorant for ignorance? Can the rich be allowed to escape with his spoil and the learned without obligation for his knowledge? If the black men in America are what they are because of slavery and oppression, how cowardly for white Christians to deny their own guilt. The real hypocrisy comes, however, when the Negro, eager to take responsibility, cries out for power with which to bear it and is denied such power. Denied higher training for his leaders, denied industrial opportunity to make a living, the self-assertion and self-defense of the ballot, denied even hospitals and common schools. Thus the church gaily tosses him stones for bread.\nEven the rock of “Science” on which the white church rested with such beautiful faith, hoping to prove the majority of humanity inhuman, so that Fifth Avenue Presbyterianism would not have to dirty its dainty fingers with Fifty-third Street Baptists — and black ones at that — even this Rock of Ages is falling before honest investigation.\nThere is but the Golden Rule left — the despised and rejected Golden Rule. Can the church follow it? Is there common decency enough in the millions of white American church members to dare to treat Negroes as they would like to be treated if they themselves were colored?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Church (1916)\nCrime (1918)\nSteal (1920)\nThe White Church (1917)\nDiscrimination (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “The Church and the Negro.”\nThe Crisis 6 (6): 290–91. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/06/06/church_negro.html."

The secretary of the New York Peace Society writes us that “Our peace congresses have not dealt in the past with the relations of civilized and non-civilized people;” and he thinks that largely on this account “our American congresses have been more dignified and more influential than those held abroad.”\nWe are not sure about that word “influential,” but there is no doubt about the dignity of the American peace movement. It has been so dignified and aristocratic that it has been often most difficult for the humbler sort of folk to recognize it as the opponent of organized murder.\nAt a recent meeting of the New York Peace Society the war in the Balkans was eulogized and applauded, and the president stated that “when we advocate peace” it is for nations “worthy of it!” Such a peace movement belies its name. Peace to-day, if it means anything, means the stopping of the slaughter of the weaker by the stronger in the name of Christianity and culture. The modern lust for land and slaves in Africa, Asia and the South Seas is the greatest and almost the only cause of war between the so-called civilized peoples. For such “colonial” aggression and “imperial” expansion England, France, Germany, Russia and Austria are straining every nerve to arm themselves; against such policies Japan and China are arming desperately. And yet the American peace movement thinks it bad policy to take up this problem of machine guns, natives and rubber, and wants “constructive” work in “arbitration treaties and international law.” For our part we think that a little less dignity and dollars and a little more humanity would make the peace movement in America a great democratic philanthropy instead of an aristocratic refuge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nResolutions of the Washington Conference (1917)\nPeace (1933)\nPeace (1915)\nJust Like—Folks (1920)\nClose Ranks (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “Peace.” The Crisis 6 (1):\n26. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/06/01/peace.html."

    "text": "There is scarcely a community in the United States where a group of colored people live that has not its vigilance committee. Sometimes this committee is organized and has a name indicating its function. Sometimes it is organized for other purposes and becomes a vigilance committee on occasion. In other cases the committee has no regular organization or membership; it springs into being on occasion, but consists of approximately the same group of persons from year to year.\nThe work of these vigilance committees is to protect the colored people in their several communities from aggression.\nThe aggression takes the form of hostile laws and ordinances, curtailment of civil rights, new racial discriminations, overtax or oversevere enforcement of the law, curtailment of opportunities, etc. Sometimes this aggression is but the careless act of thoughtless folk and needs but a word in season to correct it. More often it is a part of that persistent underground campaign centering largely among white Americans of Southern birth which is determined so to intrench color caste in the United States as to make it impossible for any person of Negro blood to be more than a menial.\nAgainst both sorts of racial aggression organized effort is necessary. Many thoughtful colored people have sought to avoid this; to act independently and to refuse to meet organization by organization. This in most cases has been found impossible. The blows of racial and color prejudice fall on all alike, rich and poor, educated and ignorant, and all must stand together and fight.\nThe methods of these vigilance committees are various. The simplest action is the appointment of a committee of one or more to call on some official or person of influence; from this, action extends to letters and the press, pamphlets, legislative hearings, mass meetings, petitions, etc. In a few cases threats and violence have been attempted, but these are at present exceptional.\nFrom this procedure on the part of tens of thousands of largely isolated groups much actual good has been done and much experience accumulated.\nThe time is now evidently at hand to fund and pool this nation-wide experience, and to systematize this scattered local effort into steady, persistent and unwavering pressure. As it is, unorganized local effort loses much time and energy in reorganizing for every new object: organized local efforts lack experience and knowledge of similar action elsewhere. Henceforth we must act together and we must fight continuously.\nThe object of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is to federate local vigilance committees among colored people in every community in the United States; to coordinate their activities, to exchange experiences and to concentrate the application of funds where the need is greatest.\nHitherto we have spoken almost exclusively of the central office of the association in New York and its work. The central office is now permanently established, with executive officers and an organ of publicity read by at least 150,000 of the most intelligent colored people in the land.\nWe are now turning our attention to the branches in order, on the one hand, to build a sure foundation and support for the national body and, on the other hand, chiefly to federate and organize the local battle against race prejudice.\nWhat then is a local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People?\nIt is an organization of men and women, white and colored, working in a given locality for the overthrow of race prejudice and color caste. It should have, among other things, twelve principal functions:\n\nLegislation. It should watch hostile and discriminating legislation, hostile and discriminating administration of the law and injustice in the courts.\nDiscrimination. It should note the barometer of racial discrimination and see that it does not fall a single degree in the matters of civil rights, in parks, museums, theatres and places of public accommodation and amusement. It should note new efforts at discrimination, have them systematically and promptly reported. It should note old habits of discrimination and have them wisely but persistently opposed. It should note the action of the police and discrimination in charitable and settlement work.\nLegal Redress. It should see that good test cases of the rights of Negro citizens are brought before the courts and strong decisions obtained.\nLaws. It should seek to secure new laws and ordinances to protect the lives and property of citizens and to prevent race discrimination. In cases where race discrimination is too strongly intrenched to be attacked at present it should secure at least equal rights and accommodations for colored citizens.\nEducation. It should see that every colored child between the ages of 5 and 14 years is in school; that the largest possible number of colored children finish the high school; that every colored boy and girl who shows good ability goes to a good college; that careful technical training in some branch of modern industry is furnished all colored children. It should see that libraries, museums, ete., are open to colored folk and that they use them.\nHealth. It should conserve the health and healthful habits of the colored people, particularly in the matters of fresh air, sensible clothing, good food and healthy amusement.\nOccupations. It should see that the colored youth have a larger opportunity for employment at better wages than now; that they have a chance of promotion according to merit; that they are urged into new and higher avenues of endeavor, especially in lines of literature, pictorial art, music, business, executive work and skilled labor of the higher sorts and scientific farming. It should see that co-operative effort to furnish capital is encouraged and wise investments extended and guarded, and capital put at the disposal of the honest and efficient.\nCo-operation. It should endeavor to co-operate and advise with all general philanthropic effort and have the colored people represented on boards of control.\nPublicity and Information. It should stop the conscious and unconscious enmity of the daily and weekly press and seek to abate scurrilous headlines and contemptuous and belittling reports; it should send letters to newspapers, answer attacks, visit the editors; furnish the papers with news of events; give facilities to reporters to see the best and follow them up; it should see that the cause of the Negro is represented on all public occasions; it should send lecturers and lantern slides to clubs and meetings, etc. It should publish pamphlets and distribute them and use every opportunity to make the Negro church a vehicle of uplifting information to Negroes.\nRacial Contact. It should use every opportunity to bring the best representatives of both races into helpful and enlightening contact; it should bring white lecturers on all subjects to colored audiences and colored lecturers to white audiences; it should arrange conferences.\nPolitical Action. It should see that colored people qualify as voters according to law and vote intelligently at every election. It should keep the records of legislators and Congressmen on racial discrimination and publish the record before each election with such promises for the future as can be obtained. It should discourage and expose bribery, and support only the best qualified candidates, black and white.\nMeetings. The branch should have an executive committee, which should meet regularly at least once a month for reports and plan of campaign. It should have a secretary with an office open each day. It should arrange at least four times a year large meetings of members and friends for lectures, reports and protests.\n\nIn fine, the local branch should try, in each community, North and South, East and West, to solve the Negro problem in that community by making the injustice of discrimination clear to all, and the need of equal opportunity plain to the most prejudiced.\nFinally, let the locals support the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. We have 1,500 members. We want 10,000 members who will contribute at least a dollar apiece to the national body in order to effect the second and final emancipation of the Negro in America; in order that the national body may become a great clearing house for information and experience, and be able to concentrate money and help on particular plague spots of prejudice.\nWe have ten branches which are beginning work as outlined above. Who will be the next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nN.A.A.C.P.

For a time they held back the spectacular fire caters and marked time, being content with the dismissal of two or three leading Negro officeholders. Then they plucked up courage. Postmaster-General Burleson is said on good authority to have frankly announced this policy: The gradual weeding of the Negro out of the civil service of the United States until he is left only menial positions. Encouraged by this the white railway mail clerks are conducting a systematic and open campaign against the colored clerks in defiance of the plain rules of the service. The official organ, the Railway Mail, says editorially:\n\nThere is a new man at the head of the postoffice department, a man from the South, who knows the Negro problem as it is. ….\n  Of course the Negroes will oppose this measure because they feel it is the first step in removing them entirely from the service. They assert that they have the qualifications and the ambition to make good railway mail clerks. While not admitting this as a general rule, we will let it pass, because it has no bearing on the question of separating the black clerks from the white. They are inclined to argue the proposition, not realizing that it is a matter of feeling and not argument.\n  The Negroes utterly fail to understand our reasons for desiring separation. It is impossible for them to realize our viewpoint. They do not know that it is a matter of racial instinct that causes the Negro to be repulsive to the white man when associating with him on the same social plane. It is useless for the Negro to speak of his qualifications, his progress, his ambition, that does not remove our instinctive racial dislike.\n\nThis is the kind of thing which the Bourbon South is trying to inject into the civil service. We understand that in the Treasury Department alone six or more of the oldest and best colored clerks have been dismissed and that determined effort is being made to segregate colored clerks in all branches of the civil service.\nTo this we must add the fact that certain “Jim Crow” legislation has been proposed and that President Wilson has not yet dared to appoint n single colored man to office.\nThe last point would be of less significance were it not coupled as usual with efforts at discrimination: the right to vote and hold office insure civil rights. It is time, therefore, that Northern Democrats bestirred themselves. It is time that Negroes were aroused to action. It is no time to say “I told you so!” or to sit still. Bad as the Democrats may prove, they cannot outdo William H. Taft.\nThe government is still ours and we have the right to protest to President, Senators and Congressmen against the machinations of Burleson and his ilk.\nWe give President Wilson the highest credit for his attempt to lighten our burden of tariff taxation and his frank and fearless currency bill. But we must remind him that the ills of this nation are not purely economic. When the London Spectator named the stopping of lynching as one of the new President’s three greatest tasks it spoke no idle word.\nAnd lynching begins not with the drunken blood lust of a wild gang of men and boys, but with the every-day white citizen who finds that race prejudice pays as an investment; helps him to win over his black competitor in the civil-service examination; helps him to get his fellow workman’s job; helps to indulge the beast instinct to despise and trample on the weak.\nThis is the kind of thing that Woodrow Wilson must fight and he must fight it in his own Cabinet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Crusade (1914)\nMemphis or East St. Louis?

Her active life, beginning with her first published book of poems, covered over sixty years of stirring history, from the Compromise of 1850 down to Mr. Taft’s inaugural address. She was associated with all the great leaders of the abolition cause and has lectured to hundreds of audiences throughout the land.\nIt is, however, for her attempts to forward literature among colored people that Frances Harper deserves most to be remembered. She was not a great singer, but she had some sense of song; she was not a great writer, but she wrote much worth reading. She was above all, sincere. She took her writing soberly and earnestly; she gave her life to it, and it gave her fair support. She was a worthy member of that dynasty, beginning with dark Phyllis in 1773 and coming on down past David Walker, Wells Brown, Nell, Whitman and Williams, down to Dunbar, Chesnuit and Braithwaite of our day.\nTo the young colored American Frances Harper leaves a lesson. Here is a nation whose soul is still dumb, yet big with feeling, song and story. What are we doing to develop writers to express this wealth of emotion fitly? Very little. We have among ten millions to-day one poet, one novelist and two or three recognized writers of articles and essays. That is all.\nHere is a tremendous field for improvement, and if in the next six months The Crisis receives the same remarkable encouragement as in the past we hope to have ready for the beginning of our second year’s work a matured plan for encouraging young writers to follow the hallowed footsteps of Frances Watkins Harper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Younger Literary Movement (1924)\nNegro Writers (1920)\nDePriest (1929)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nA Crusade (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “The Writer.” The Crisis 1\n(6): 20–21. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/06/writer.html."

    "text": "The object of this publication is to set forth those facts and arguments which show the danger of race prejudice, particularly as manifested to-day toward colored people. It takes its name from the fact that the editors believe that this is a critical time in the history of the advancement of men. Catholicity and tolerance, reason and forbearance can to-day make the world-old dream of human brotherhood approach realization; while bigotry and prejudice, emphasized race consciousness and force can repeat the awful his tory of the contact of nations and groups in the past. We strive for this higher and broader vision of Peace and Good Will.\nThe policy of The Crisis will be simple and well defined:\nIt will first and foremost be a newspaper: it will record important happenings and movements in the world which bear on the great problem of inter-racial relations, and especially those which affect the Negro-American.\nSecondly, it will be a review of opinion and literature, recording briefly books, articles, and important expressions of opinion in the white and colored press on the race problem.\nThirdly, it will publish a few short articles.\nFinally, its editorial page will stand for the rights of men, irrespective of color or race, for the highest ideals of American democracy, and for reasonable but earnest and persistent attempt to gain these rights and realize these ideals. The magazine will be the organ of no clique or party and will avoid personal rancor of all sorts. In the absence of proof to the contrary it will assume honesty of purpose on the part of all men, North and South, white and black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe New Crisis (1925)\nRadicals (1919)\nA Statement (1919)\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nThe Truth (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1910. “The Crisis.” The Crisis 1\n(1): 10. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/01/TheCrisis.html."

    "text": "Some people in Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, Columbus, O., and other Northern cities are quietly trying to establish separate colored schools. This is wrong, and should be resisted by black men and white. Human contact, human acquaintanceship, human sympathy is the great solvent of human problems. Separate school children by wealth and the result is class misunderstanding and hatred. Separate them by race and the result is war. Separate them by color and they grow up without learning the tremendous truth that it is impossible to judge the mind of a man by the color of his face. Is there any truth that America needs to learn more? Back of this demand for the segregation of black folk in public institutions, or the segregation of Italians, or the segregation of any class, is almost always a shirking of responsibility on the part of the public—a desire to put off on somebody else the work of social uplift, while they themselves enjoy its results. Nobody pretends to deny that probably three-fourths of the colored children in the public schools of a great Northern city are below the average of their fellow students in some respects. They are, however, capable of improvement, and of rapid improvement. This improvement can be carried on by the community. The community can, however, if it is cowardly and selfish, shirk this responsibility and pile it on the shoulders of the Negroes represented by the one-fourth of Negro children who are above the average, or equal to it; and they can, if they are persistent, succeed in pushing back and possibly overwhelming a deserving and rising class of colored people.\nThis is the history of color discrimination in general in Philadelphia, New York and Chicago. When the discrimination comes in various lines of life, it does not bear simply on those who are not hurt by it—who do not feel it, and who by their position naturally fall outside the lines of discrimination, but it comes with crushing weight upon those other Negroes to whom the reasons for discrimination do not apply in the slightest respect, and they are thus made to bear a double burden. Further than this, when the discrimination is once established, immediately the public provisions for the segregated portion become worse. If it is discrimination against poor people, then the schools for the poor people become worse than those for the rich—less well equipped and less well supervised. If it is discrimination against colored people, the colored school becomes poor, with less money and less means of efficiency.\nThe argument, then, for color discrimination in schools and in public institutions is an argument against democracy and an attempt to shift public responsibility from the shoulders of the public to the shoulders of some class who are unable to defend themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEducation (1911)\nSegregation (1934)\nSeparation and Self-Respect (1934)\nReconstruction (1919)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1910. “Segregation.” The Crisis 1\n(1): 10–11. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/01/Segregation.html."

    "text": "We doubt if the Twentieth Century will bring forth a greater idea than the First Universal Races Congress in London, in the summer of 1911. Its possibilities are tremendous and its plan unique. Many will, of course, instinctively fear it. They will ask: “What good after all can come of such a congress? What can it do save talk—what can it initiate save profitless agitation?” The chief outcome of the Congress will be human contact—the meeting of men; not simply the physical meeting, eye to eye and hand to hand of those actually present, but the resultant spiritual contact which will run round the world.\nGreat as is the theoretical value of such human meeting there are many men and good men who shrink from it with strange fear. Some quail at meeting any stranger, more at meeting men alien in look and habit.\nOutside this physical shrinking which we have in common with children, comes the mental recoil—the disinclination to have our thoughts and ideas disarranged and upset. And still further on comes the moral dread of blame—of facing the man we have wronged and hearing the hurt from his own quivering lips. From such fears comes an eagerness to justify exclusion—to refuse any association with lower classes or lower races and sometimes in extreme cases we seek in our panic to build walls and say not simply “I will not meet and listen to the stranger,’ but”you shall not on penalty of my high displeasure.”\nThe Races Congress is the meeting of the World on a broad plane of human respect and equality. In no other way is human understanding and world peace and progress possible. Every attempt to reach the desired goal otherwise has had failure written on its forehead.\nTo be sure, we are fond of experimenting in these lines. We like to assemble on the avenue and discuss the East Side or meet at Mohonk and discuss the Indians, who are seldom present, or form a Southern Educational Board, whose meetings no Negro may attend. Such meetings may do good, but they can never settle the problems they attempt and their unanimity is always deceptive and often misleading. Only the man himself can speak for himself. We say: Put yourself in his place; but after all we know that no human soul can thus change itself. The voice of the oppressed alone can tell the real meaning of oppression and, though the voice be tremulous, excited and even incoherent, it must be listened to if the world would learn and know.\nOnly then in a world-wide contact of men in which the voices of all races are heard shall we begin that contact and sympathy which in God’s good time will bring out of war and hatred and prejudice a real democracy of races and of nations. As some slight step toward this vast end has the Races Congress been called in London.\nTo such a meeting should go particularly those people to whom the physical differences of race and nation are ridiculous or incomprehensible, those to whom mental disagreement is foolishness and those who cannot see that the canons of morality extend beyond their own family or nation, or color of skin. From such a congress should come the beginnings of a vast tolerance and sympathy. Not only a tolerance of the Chinese and Hindus on the part of Europeans, but the just as necessary comprehension of European thought and morality on the part of millions of darker peoples who have slight cause to view it with respect. We may sympathize with the great Peace Movement, we may sympathize with world-wide efforts for moral reform and social uplift, but before them all we must place those efforts which aim to make humanity not the attribute of the arrogant and born to good wages and the exclusive, but the heritage of all men in a world where most men are colored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe World in Council (1911)\nThe Races in Congress (1911)\nThe Durham Conference (1927)\nResolutions of the Washington Conference (1917)\nThe National Interracial Conference (1929)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1910. “The Races in Conference.”\nThe Crisis 1 (2): 17, 20. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/02/races_in_conference.html."

The play had been upon the Negro question, and one couple had been especially thrilled by the fine heroism of the white man, who, finding that he had a few drops of colored blood, allied himself with the despised race. “How magnificent,” they were saying, “to dedicate oneself to the cause of the oppressed!”\nWalking a few blocks they turned into a restaurant. After giving their order they noticed a man, a mulatto in coloring, enter and seat himself at a table. Presently a waiter came to him and whispered something. The man shook his head, and the waiter went to the proprietor.\n“I really believe,” the couple said, watching curiously, “that they are going to ask that man to leave. What a shame, for he is quite light and very good looking.”\nThe proprietor came to the man as he sat at the table, and after a few words, the couple amusing themselves guessing their import, the colored man rose and left.\n“That was too bad, wasn’t it,” one said to the other, “and right here in our own city.

It is this: “People who resemble each other in one important respect ought to resemble each other in all important respects and therefore be treated alike. If by any chance they do not so resemble each other, this is unfortunate, for the same treatment must be meted out. This is inevitable.”\nIs it? It is not inevitable. It is criminal injustice. It is inhuman treatment and it is socially dangerous. It is based on the unscientific assumption that human beings who resemble each other in one important particular, like color of skin, resemble each other in all particulars. This is patently false. Moreover, the social condemnation of an undesirable act or character loses all force or reason when it is directed against one who has not committed the act or has not the condemned character.

    "text": "There are two situations where it is hard to be courteous: when courtesy involves public condemnation; and when courtesy demanded by the discourteous. The first is the problem of the white American, the second is the dilemma of the black American. Shall you rise in the street car and give that colored woman a seat, Mr. O’Brien, despite the grins and comments of your fellows? And you, Mr. Johnson, shall you surrender your seat to the white woman whose manner toward you is a personal insult? Yes—yes, in both cases, and yes, with a full realization, a personal realization, of the cost. A raised hat, or a title of courtesy in the South by any white man to any colored woman usually means severe social condemnation. For a Negro to offer courtesies to white people usually means that the courtesy will be snatched as a right, or angrily refused; even if it is graciously accepted there remains in the Negro’s breast the knowledge that he is giving what he, his wife or his child would never receive under reversed circumstances, and he half despises himself for being a gentleman.\nSuch feelings explain much apparent discourtesy. White men, particularly Southern white men, are often more harsh, sharp and insulting to colored people than they would dream of being were it not for the battle between instinctive courtesy and fear of public opinion which is raging in their own hearts. They resent passionately the false position to which they are thus forced and the victim suffers.\nSo, too, black men are often rudely and impudently impolite, truculent even toward friends and well-wishers because they are blindly and instinctively throwing up defenses against possible insult or taking present revenge for past discourtesy.\nAll this is wrong. No black man can afford to be less than studiously polite even in the face of possible insult. And the white man, North or South, whose courtesy does not extend to the weak, the helpless and the black, is not a gentleman, no matter whose grandson he may be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Matter of Manners (1933)\nA Matter of Manners (1920)\nSeparation (1911)\nVeiled Insults (1914)\nSocial Equality (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Politeness.” The Crisis 1\n(5): 21. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/05/politeness.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There is living to-day in the city of Washington a white-haired man of towering physique who was born in New Hampshire in 1834. He was admitted to the bar in 1859 and became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Civil War. On December 6, 1875, he was elected a representative in the United States Congress, and from June, 1879, to March, 1891, was United States Senator from New Hampshire; and his name is Blair.\nOn July 29, 1876, Henry William Blair delivered a speech on “Free Schools” in the House of Representatives which marked the beginning of his career. In 1881 as Chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor in the United States Senate, Mr. Blair introduced the celebrated Blair bill.\nThe Blair bill was discussed for ten years, passed the Senate of the United States three times, commanded at least twice a majority in the House of Representatives, although it was not permitted to come to a vote, and was finally defeated in the United States Senate in 1890 by a combination of New England and Middle West votes.\nThe Blair bill as reported to the 48th Congress provided:\n\nThat for ten years after the passage of this act there shall be annually appropriated from the money in the Treasury the following sums, to wit: The first year the sum of $15,000,000; the second year, the sum of $14,000,000: the third year the sum of $13,000,000. and thereafter a sum diminished $1,000,000 yearly from the sum last appropriated until ten annual appropriations shall have been made, when all appropriations under this act shall cease; which several sums shall be expended to secure the benefits of common-school education of all children of the school age mentioned hereafter living in the United States.   Sec. 2. That such money shall annually be divided among and paid out in the several States and Territories in that proportion which the whole number of persons in each, who, being of the age of ten years and over, cannot read and write bears to the whole number of such persons in the United States; and until otherwise provided such computation shall be made according to the official returns of the census of 1880.   Sec. 5. That the instruction in the common schools wherein these moneys shall be expended shall include the art of reading, writing and speaking the English language, arithmetic, geography, history of the United States and such other branches of useful knowledge as may be taught under local laws, and shall include, whenever practicable, instruction in the arts of industry, and the instruction of females in such branches of technical or industrial education as are suited to their sex, which instruction shall be free to all, without distinction of race, color, nativity or condition of life: Provided, that nothing herein shall deprive children of different races, living in the same community, but attending separate schools, from receiving the benefits of this act the same as though the attendance therein were without distinction of race.\n\nThe sentiment in favor of this bill was tremendous. Garfield mentioned it in his inaugural address, the Peabody trustees favored it, Dr. J.L.M. Curry spoke for it, the American Missionary Association, the Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian Missionary and Educational Societies sent in memorials signed by men like Michael Striebv and Samuel C. Armstrong of Hampton; State school superintendents from Georgia, Maryland, and South Carolina sent in letters; W.T. Harris, of the Bureau of Education, was “heartily in favor” and Southern Congressmen like Wade Hampton, Vance of North Carolina, Brown and Colquit of Georgia, Lamar and George of Mississippi, Call of Florida, Pugh of Alabama, Bayard of Delaware and Beck of Kentucky, voted for the bill.\nThere was, however, opposition from influential quarters, an opposition not to education but to Federal aid. It was feared that local responsibility would be weakened and the federal power unduly extended. So the bill died.\nWhat has been the result? In 1870 there were seven and a half million illiterates over ten years of age in the United States. Forty years later there are over six million illiterates. Moreover, these six million illiterates are those who admit that they are illiterate. How many more millions have deceived the census takers? Then, too, the ability to read and write does not spell intelligence.\nIn other words, we have to-day in the United States a staggering problem of sheer ignorance. Can we found democratic government on such a basis? REVIVE THE BLAiR BILL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nIntentions (1923)\nByrnes (1919)\nThe South in the Saddle (1914)\nAn Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson (1913)\nEducation (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “The Blair Bill.” The Crisis\n1 (5): 16--17. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/05/blair_bill.html."

    "text": "It is a cruel mental strain to which honest colored men are being put to-day, particularly in the South. They want to come to terms with their neighbors. They are being urged to do this—urged by black leaders and white and by strong public opinion. The South sometimes is represented as aggressively friendly. They are seeking piteously, therefore, to agree wjth the dominant race and yet preserve something of their self-respect. It is very difficult. Take, for instance, the letter of an honest colored man in the New Orleans Times-Democrat. He says:\n\nWhatever may be the opinion of others concerning the drawing of the color line in the South, the thoughtful Negro has accepted it as a fixed principle, realizing that the race has absolutely nothing to fear or lose by social separation. Social intermingling has always meant social degradation to the less advanced element. It may set the minds of many people at rest to know that the Negro is willing and ready to meet the the most advanced thought of the South on its own ground.\n\nHe then swallows segregation whole; he would accept separate stores, separate physicians and lawyers, separate schools, separate school superintendents, separate street cars–all and complete, because, as he concludes: “The Negro does not desire racial intermingling. All he wants is a square deal before the law.”\nPrecisely. But the thing that this black man would better ask himself good and hard is this: Is such separation physically and politically possible, and under it is there the slightest likelihood of the segregated getting “a square deal”? No. Such counsellors of surrender stand willing to sacrifice the foundations of democracy for peace. Why does the world ask equality? Out of personal bravado and impudence? No, but for self-protection. If you can separate people by color, you can separate them by birth, by wealth, by ability and any accident. This once done and democracy is dead before Privilege.\nOr turn to the other side: the white South does not want Separation, but Subordination. They do not want separate Negro schools, but Negro schools under the control of white superintendence who hold the purse strings. They do not want separate cars, but cars which Negroes may not enter save as servants. They do not want to stop social intermingling, but they do want to prescribe the conditions.\nIn other words, the separation of the races which would involve political, economic and social independence in the South would be as hateful to them as social intermingling. Every man, then, that bows to the dogma of race separation must accept subordination and humiliation along with the destruction of the best ideals of democracy.\nThose who persist in opposition to it need not be scared by bugbears of possible intermarriage. In a true democracy and there alone are sexual relations regulated by giving to all the right to choose their consorts. Only in an oligarchy like Louisiana is race intermingling so endless that they cannot enforce their own race segregation laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSocial Equality (1916)\nLight (1912)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nIntermarriage (1913)\nCorrespondence (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Separation.” The Crisis 1\n(4): 20–21. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/04/separation.html."

Life is not as funny as it used to be, and these papers are a good deal funnier. This brings the two types into something like competition at times. Take, for instance, the Charleston News and Courier. On most matters it is a sane and able newspaper, but let it approach the Negro problem and directly it begins to strut and darken in a way that would surely excite a smile did it not touch so vast a tragedy. When the late Alabama peonage cases reached the Supreme Court the News and Courier lifted a portentously warning finger. Look out, it shouted in calmly dignified tones, look out! Do not interfere with the divinely established economic harmony of the rural South. The Negro must be made to work. Our methods may lack delicacy and ease, but—and the editor spread his hands—what is peonage between friends? We are sure, he continued, that the Supreme Court will hesitate long before disturbing laws on which Southern prosperity depends.\nThe Supreme Court calmly overthrew the law. The News and Courier did not wink an eye or turn an eyelash. It simply revolved toward the Negroes and delivered itself of this inimitable bit of reflection: This is a hard blow for you black folk—you’ll get no more money advanced to you as farmhands and you’ll probably starve. On the other hand, this decision is a blessing for us landlords.\nAll of which leads us to ask: Is the dominant, implacable portion of the white South, which speaks so loudly and incessantly on this race problem and with such perfect and breathless assurance—is it joking on this vast problem, or is it talking for effect?\nAnd this again, as we said in the beginning, makes us wild for the last copy of Life, Puck or Judge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRadicals (1919)\nDodging the Issue (1933)\nThe Macon Telegraph (1920)\nLight (1912)\nThe Newest South (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Southern Papers.”\nThe Crisis 1 (4): 21. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/04/southern_papers.html."

He is arrested under a law the essential principle of which has since been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Courts of both South Carolina and the United States.\nHis plea of self-defense in killing an armed and unannounced midnight intruder into the very bedroom of himself and his wife, after he himself had been shot, would have absolutely freed any white man on earth from the slightest guilt or punishment. Yet it could not free a colored man in South Carolina. It brought a sentence of murder in the first degree.\nGovernor Ansell in commuting his sentence to imprisonment for life did a brave thing. Why was it brave? Because it was just? No, it was unjust. To punish this innocent man with a terrible sentence—one almost worse than death, were it not for the hope ahead—is a terribly unjust deed. Yet Governor Ansell’s act was brave because of public opinion in South Carolina; because the dominant public opinion of that State demanded this boy’s blood; because Governor Ansell took his political future in his hands when he defied this opinion.

Therefore I always go to different groups of colored people in this land with much of interest and curiosity, knowing that each will present its peculiar phase of relationship between the white and colored group.\nI have just come back from such a journey, and its scenes and lessons are filling my thought.\nThere was Toledo, with its colored group a little pushed aside and half forgotten in the onward rush of the growing city till the group gripped itself and awoke and said: “We are a part of Toledo—you may not forget us.” So now slowly comes the push forward and upward.\nIn Cleveland it is far different—it is not so much a matter of gaining civic recognition as men and women—that battle was fought by worthy men long years ago. It is the deeper problem of holding the ground gained; of not letting theatres and restaurants and hotels inaugurate a new discrimination which had once disappeared. This is a difficult battle of the new economic rise of the Negro; when few Negroes applied or had money to apply it was easy to say theoretically, “Live where you will, go where you please.” But when a group of black folk growing in power put a $75,000 church on your corner—that is a phase of the race problem that hadn’t struck you before.\nBetween these cities of past and present lies the mystic city of the future, with its great cloud walls.\nIn Oberlin there are nearly two thousand young folk at study and at play. Working and playing beside them are a hundred colored boys and girls, and they all walk on sacred ground, on ground long since consecrated to racial equality and hatred of caste and slavery. Yet among these venerable ideals obtrudes the Present and it, with all its odd corners, must be builded into the future city.\nThe present holds not only the problem of the treatment of ten million black folk elsewhere, but of the hundred colored boys and girls right there in Oberlin. It presents a tremendous moral dilemma to frank young souls. When these children came from anti-slavery homes they found it easy and natural to treat black men as men. But coming now from a world that thinks God made a big mistake in ever creating black folk—coming from such social teaching, they hesitate. Once in a while a black student (or rather a yellow one) may be elected a society, but usually no desert in character or scholarship avails.\nYet this fact brings no mental peace or moral satisfaction. The spirit of democracy is strong, the influence of the faculty is righteous, and I came from five hours’ earnest conference with these young folk with a sense of seeing a mighty battle for righteousness, and a belief that somehow, sometime, justice would prevail.\nBut after all it was the men I met that meant most. Could I introduce them? Let me see. There was the young lawyer who burned to awaken a sleeping city to its duties and rights; there was the brown physician who is one of the leading surgeons in the city, and his knife finds no color line. Then the girl who ran a political campaign last month had a father who was director in a white bank and one of the solid business men of the town. In their parlor gathered a brown father, a yellow mother, the white pastor and the white girl chum—but why should we catalog the colors of their skins and not those of their clothes? In Oberlin the chief book store is “colored,” and the chief paper hanger and the chief building contractor. Elsewhere I sat with the man who had just been elected a member of a leading white city club and heard how the second highest mechanic in the Peerless motor factory wore “the shadowed livery of the sun.”\nTherefore, all is well? Therefore, all is not well. Here are a climbing people. The hardiest and most talented and the pushing are literally forcing a way. But against them and against the ordinary black man the bonds of medievalism are drawn and ghettos and sumptuary laws are encompassed in the color line.\nW. E. B.

They argue:\nWhite men alone are men. This Negro wants to be a man. Ergo he wants to be a white man.\nTheir attention is drawn to the efforts of colored people to be treated decently. This minor premise therefore attracts them. But the major premise—the question as to treating black men like white men—never enters their heads, nor can they conceive it entering the black man’s head. If he wants to be a man he must want to be white, and therefore it is with peculiar complacency that a Tennessee paper says of a dark champion of Negro equality: “He bitterly resents his Negro blood.”\nNot so, O Blind Man. He bitterly resents your treatment of Negro blood. The prouder he is, or has a right to be, of the blood of his black fathers, the more doggedly he resists the attempt to load men of that blood with ignominy and chains.

    "title": "A Question of Policy and The Philosophy of Mr. Dole",
    "section": "The Philosophy of Mr. Dole",
    "text": "The Philosophy of Mr. Dole\nWe publish very gladly Mr. Dole’s criticism of The Crisis, because of our deep respect for the writer and because he voices a real and vital disagreement with our policy which is continually, in one way or another, coming to expression. It is briefly this thesis: “Don’t antagonize, don’t be bitter; say the conciliatory thing; make friends and do not repel them; insist on and emphasize the cheerful and good and dwell as little as possible on wrong and evil.”\nThe Crisis does not believe in this policy so far as the present status of the American Negro problem is concerned. We could imagine many social problems, and many phases in a particular problem, when the watchful waiting, the tactfully conciliatory attitude would be commendable and worth while. At other times it would be suicidal and this, in our opinion, is one of the times.\nIt was ever so. When the Hebrew prophets cried aloud there were respectable persons by the score who said:\n“Unfortunate exaggeration!”\n“Unnecessary feeling!”\n“Ungodly bitterness!”\nYet the jeremiads were needed to redeem a people. When the abolitionists began, not simply to say, but to act as if slavery were a “covenant with hell,” there were plenty of timid souls “on the fence, hesitating,” who scrambled down hastily on the popular side and were willing to lynch Garrison and ostracize Phillips.\nAll this might be beside the mark if we had not already tried Mr. Dole’s prescriptions. For now nearly twenty years we have made of ourselves mudsills for the feet of this Western world. We have echoed and applauded every shameful accusation made against 10,000,000 victims of slavery. Did they call us inferior half-beasts? We nodded our simple heads and whispered: “We is.” Did they call our women prostitutes and our children bastards? We smiled and cast a stone at the bruised breasts of our wives and daughters. Did they accuse us of laziness 4,000,000 sweating, struggling laborers, half paid and cheated out of much of that? We shrieked: “Ain’t it so?” We laughed with them at our color, we joked at our sad past, and we told chicken stories to get alms.\nAnd what was the result? We got “friends.” I do not believe any people ever had so many “friends” as the American Negro to-day! He has nothing but “friends” and may the good God deliver him from most of them, for they are like to lynch his soul.\nWhat is it to be a friend of the Negro? It is to believe in anything for him except, perhaps, total and immediate annihilation. Short of that, good and kind friends of colored folk believe that he is, in Mr. Dooley’s charming phrase, “aisily lynched,” and ought to be occasionally. Even if 2,662 accused black people have been publicly lynched, burned and mutilated in twenty-eight years (not to mention the murder of perhaps 10,000 other black folk), our friends think we ought not to disturb the good President of these United States because “the wonder is that there is so little killing!”\nIt is the old battle of the better and the best. The worst foes of Negro manhood to-day are those compromising friends who are willingly satisfied with even less than half a loaf. They want the Negro educated; but the South objects to Negro colleges. Oh, very well, then, high schools; but the South objects to literary training for niggers! Dear, dear! Then industrial training; but the South objects to training any considerable number of Negroes for industry; it wants them for menial service. Very well, train them as servants and field hands—anything as long as it is education! Then we and The Crisis rise and say: “But——” Our friends raise deprecating hands; they adjust the sofa pillows, shade the light, and say: “Now, now! give them the benefit of the doubt!”\nOr we clamor for the right to vote. “Of course you should vote,” say our friends. “But,” says the South, “they are too ignorant and inexperienced; we will vote for them.” “Excellent,” cry our friends, “vote for them and guard them in their civil rights.” “What’s this?” asks the South. “We mean their economic rights,” say our friends glibly, “their right to work and get property.” “Yes,” answers the South calmly, “the right to work, and we’ll work them.” “But———” cries The Crisis and the black man who has been worked long enough. “Sh!” answer our friends. “You’ll halt the procession!”\nThat’s precisely what we intend to do. For twenty-five years we have let the procession go by until the systematic denial of manhood rights to black men in America is the crying disgrace of the century. We have wrongs, deep and bitter wrongs. There are local and individual exceptions; there are some mitigating circumstances; there is much to be excused; there is much to be said; and yet for the great mass of 10,000,000 Americans of Negro descent these things are true:\nWe are denied education.\nWe are driven out of the Church of Christ.\nWe are forced out of hotels, theatres and public places.\nWe are publicly labeled like dogs when we travel.\nWe can seldom get decent employment.\nWe are forced down to the lowest wage scale.\nWe pay the highest rent for the poorest homes.\nWe cannot buy property in decent neighborhoods.\nWe are held up to ridicule in the press and on the platform and stage.\nWe are disfranchised.\nWe are taxed without representation.\nWe are denied the right to choose our friends or to be chosen by them, but must publicly announce ourselves as social pariahs or be suggestively kicked by the Survey.\nIn law and custom our women have no rights which a white man is bound to respect.\nWe cannot get justice in the courts.\nWe are lynched with impunity.\nWe are publicly, continuously and shamefully insulted from the day of our birth to the day of our death.\nAnd yet we are told not to be “self-conscious;” to lie about the truth in order to make it “come true;” to grapple with the “philosophy of evolution;” and not to make people “feel ugly” by telling them “ugly facts.”\nFew admire Mr. Dole, personally, more than the editor of The Crisis. Mr. Dole is the type of what the American of the future may be: fine in feeling, delicate in touch, sensitive to the subtle beauties of the world. But Mr. Dole’s feet never walked the way we tread. He does not know—he cannot conceive this darker world of insult, repression, hunger and murder. He and Charles William Eliot and Woodrow Wilson and millions of others have given no encouragement to lynching, except by silence!\nExcept by silence!\nEXCEPT BY SILENCE!\nWho ever tried harder than the Negro and his “friends” to use the lie for social betterment? We have lied about the South so strenuously that this may account for the persistent blackness of our faces. Oh, yes: the South is the true, tried friend of Negroes; the South wants them educated; the South detests lynching; the South loves black mammies and buries them handsomely; the little playful antics of mobs are but ebullitions of Anglo-Saxon energy or at worst the faults of “poor white trash,” who do not count. Moreover, those who dispute these statements are either meddling white Northerners or impudent Negroes who want to marry white women.\nAll of this we black folk and our “friends” have been saying glibly and frequently. We were lying, and we knew we were lying, to make the “falsehood come true;” but did the world know this? Did we not lull this nation to false security and fatuous insensibility? And is the uneasiness of our friends at the plain talk of The Crisis the cause of ugly feeling or the necessary result of ridiculous lies? How far may we indeed meddle with the truth? Where is the boundary line between getting people “to come and believe” what is untrue and telling them on your honor that black is white? We have a sincere desire to see a little brochure by Mr. Dole—with hand-made paper, deckle edged and privately printed—on “The Uses of the Lie as a Means of Social Salvation.” We would like to distribute a few copies in Heaven among Mr. Dole’s Puritan ancestors and listen to the ensuing profanity.\nIt is the palpable evasions of our friends, and our earnest friends like Mr. Dole, that are most discouraging. When we protest at the plain insult of “negro,” Mr. Dole answers that we do not capitalize “white.” But white is not the correlative of Negro, as Mr. Dole knows right well. “Black” and “colored” are the correlatives to “white,” while Negro is used exactly as the words Malay or German or Jew or Indian are used. To refuse a word so used capitalization is a petty and usually a deliberate insult.\nHumanity is progressing toward an ideal; but not, please God, solely by help of men who sit in cloistered ease, hesitate from action and seek sweetness and light; rather we progress today, as in the past, by the soul-torn strength of those who can never sit still and silent while the disinherited and the damned clog our gutters and gasp their lives out on our front porches. These are the men who go down in the blood and dust of battle. They say ugly things to an ugly world. They spew the lukewarm fence straddlers out of their mouths, like God of old; they cry aloud and spare not; they shout from the housetops, and they make this world so damned uncomfortable with its nasty burden of evil that it tries to get good and does get better.\nEvolution is evolving the millennium, but one of the unescapable factors in evolution are the men who hate wickedness and oppression with perfect hatred, who will not equivocate, will not excuse, and will be heard. With the sainted spirits of such as these The Crisis would weakly but earnestly stand and cry in the world’s four corners of the way; and it claims no man as friend who dare not stand and cry with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nA Statement (1919)\nPrejudice (1927)\nRadicals (1919)\nLetters (1919)"

    "title": "Does Race Antagonism Serve Any Good Purpose",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There are four classes of reasons usually given in defense of Race Antagonism.\n\n\nIt is an instinctive repulsion from something harmful and is, therefore, a subtle condition of ultimate survival.\n\nThe difficulty with this theory is that it does not square with the facts: race antipathy is not instinctive but a matter of careful education. Black and white children play together gladly and know no prejudice until it is implanted precept upon precept and by strong social pressure; and when it is so implanted it is just as strong in cases where there is no physical difference as it is where physical differences are striking. The racial repulsion in the Balkans among peoples of practically the same blood is to-day greater than it was between whites and blacks on the Virginia plantations.\n\n\nRacial antagonism, whether instinctive or not, is a reasonable measure of self-defense against undesirable racial traits.\n\nThis second proposition is the one which usually follows careful examination of the first. After all, it is admitted “instinct” is an unimportant fact. Instincts are simply accumulated reasons in the individual or in the race. The reasons for antagonizing inferior races are clear and may be summed up as follows:\n\n\nPoor health and stamina.\n\nLow ability.\n\nHarmful ideals of life.\n\nWe are now on surer ground because we can now appeal to facts. But no sooner do we make this appeal than we are astonished to find that there are surprising little data: Is it true that the Negro as a physical animal is inferior to the white man or is he superior? Is the high death rate of the Indian a proof of his poor physique or is it proof of wretched conditions of life which would long ago have killed off a weaker people? And, again, is spiritual superiority always in direct proportion to physical strength in races any more than in individuals? Connected with this matter of health comes the question of physical beauty, but surely, if beauty were to become a standard of survival how small our world population would be!\nIt is argued, however, that it may be granted that the physical stamina of all races is probably approximately the same and that physical comeliness is rather a matter of taste and selection than of absolute racial difference. However, when it comes to intellectual ability the races differ so enormously that superior races must in self-defense repel the inferior sternly, even brutally. Two things, however, must be said in answer to this: First, the prejudice against the Jews, age long and world wide is surely not based on inferior ability. We have only to name Jeremiah, D’Israeli and Jesus Christ to set our minds at rest on that point. Moreover, if we compare the intellectual ability of Teuton and Chinese which is inferior? Or, if we take Englishman and Bantu, a difference of native ability or of training and environment? The answer to this is simple: We do not know. But arguing from all known facts and anologies we must certainly admit in the words of the secretary of the First International Races Congress, that “an impartial investigator would be inclined to look upon the various important peoples of the world as, to all intents and purposes, essentially equals in intellect, enterprise, morality and physique.”\n\n\nRacial antipathy is a method of Race Development.\n\nWe may admit so far as physique and native ability go, that as Ratzel says: “There is only one species of man; the variations are numerous, but do not go deep.” At the same time it is plain that Europe has out-stripped China in civilization, and China has out-stripped Africa. Here at least are plain facts. Is not racial antipathy a method of maintaining the European level of culture? But is it necessary for the runner to hate and despise the man he is outdistancing? Can we only maintain culture in one race by increasing barbarism in others? Does it enhance the “superiority” of white men to allow them to steal from yellow men and enslave black men and reduce colored women to concubinage and prostitution? Surely not. Admitting that in the world’s history again and again this or that race has out-stripped another in culture, it is impossible to prove that inherent racial superiority was the cause or that the level of culture has been permanently raised in one race by keeping other races down.\n\n\nRace Antipathy is a method of group specialization.\n\nThis argument admits the essential equality of races but insists on the difference in gifts and argues that antipathy between races allows each to develop its own peculiar gifts and aptitudes. Does it? That depends on the “antipathy.” If antipathy means the enslaving of the African, the exploitation of the Chinese, the peonage of Mexicans and the denial of schools to American Negroes then it is hard to see where the “encouragement” comes in. If it means the generous encouragement of all men according to their gifts and ability then why speak of race “antipathy” or encourage it? Let us call it Human Uplift and Universal Brotherhood and be done with it.\nSuch are the arguments. Most persons use all four at once and skillfully skip from one to the other. Each argument has in other days been applied to individuals and social classes, but we have outgrown that. We apply it to-day to “races” because race is a vague, unknown term which may be made to cover a multitude of sins. After all, what is a “Race?” and how many races are there? Von Luschan, one of the greatest of modern anthropologists, says: “The question of the number of human races has quite lost its raison d’ etre, and has become a subject rather of philosophic speculation than of scientific research.” What we have on earth is men.

    "text": "The Negro problem is undoubtedly reaching a degree of spiritual complication which makes the onlooker hesitate between tears and hysterical laughter. A National Conference of Charities and Correction recently met in a great southern city. It is a conference that numbers in its membership practically every great name in American social reform. It stands for advance and uplift, help and development in all lines of human endeavor. It met in Memphis. Memphis has a population of 142,619 with 52,441 Negroes and is the geographical center of the largest Negro population in the western world. The traveler from Altruria would surely assume that the problems touching these darker thousands and the relations of white and black would have been a matter of serious, thoughtful consideration. Not so. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People pleaded for the inclusion of such subjects as matters of general discussion. But as the Survey says, the Negro problem was “not invited” and appeared but rarely and quite incidentally on the program.\nThe excuse given by the officials was that the subject was too controversial and that the Southern Sociological Congress, meeting during the sessions of the Charities Conference, would discuss these matters. Very good. But would not this same traveller from Altruria assume that at least every effort would be made to interest colored people in the general work of the conference? Here were matters touching the saving of children, the reduction of crime, increased cleanliness, the protection of mothers, conditions of labor, etc., all of which touched the colored people very closely in their every-day life. One would have thought that the highways and hedges would have been scoured to make the colored people of Memphis, and particularly their teachers, preachers, professional men and business men, become acquainted with modern philanthropic effort. This was not done. On the contrary, at the peremptory demand of the local white committee all Negroes were segregated in the gallery and, as a result, not a dozen Negroes attended the week’s sessions of this mighty conference. How could they and retain their self-respect?\nIt is doubtless the courteous and proper thing for the National Conference to defer, in many things, to the wish and opinion of the local entertaining committee. But are there no limits to such deference? Is there no place where decency and principle can make a last stand?\nIn contrast to the moral cowardice of the northern leaders of social reform, the Southern Sociological Congress to whom the local colored committee also appealed for decent consideration in the matter of accommodation, decided that they might be admitted to the ground floor of the theatre where both associations were holding their main sessions. The proprietors of the theatre thereupon objected and the Sociological Congress changed the place of meeting. So that hundreds of colored people attended the meeting of this Congress.\nIf, however, anyone thinks that this has been a happy solution of the difficulty, let them listen to Mr. Clarence Poe, of North Carolina. Mr. Poe, in declining re-election to the Executive Committee of the Congress, says: “In the first place, I ought to explain that while I attended some of the sectional meetings of the Congress in Atlanta last year, I did not attend the general session or the race problem meetings, and it was not until I attended this year’s meetings in Memphis that I discovered that white men and white women, Negro men and Negro women are all admitted on terms of equality as members and as participants in the Congress. At Memphis, moreover, the seating of both whites and Negroes on the first floor and the- crowding out of white ladies by Negro men became so offensive (cultured ladies from my own town, for example, were escorted to their seats by Negro ushers) that the local Memphis committee could not endure it, and passed a resolution asking the officers to have the Negroes seated separately in the first balcony. And then it was that ‘the officers of the conference’ the daily papers said—I do not know what officers, for you had just left town, I believe, and so far as I know, the Executive Committee was not consulted—but at any rate, the ‘officers,’ in order to keep the Negro members right with the whites, left the Orpheum Theatre, which our Memphis hosts had provided, and adjourned to a separate theatre for a final meeting on the Negro problem at which one white man, one Negro, and one mixed-breed entertained the mixed assemblage of members.”\nThis means that advanced opinion of the South has a fight on its hands and that in the next ten years it is going to be determined whether or not the South can have two opinions concerning the Negro: one, the reactionary suppression of Poe, and the other, social uplift in “The Human Way.” Moreover, the North, characteristically, has deserted the advanced South at just the moment when the South needed it. If Graham Taylor, the President, and the Executive Committee of the Conference of Charities had said, “This conference is going to admit every decently behaved human being, who wishes to h'ear its deliberations, on equal terms,” then the Sociological Conference could have taken its stand with the moral backing of the best of the nation. As it is now, a brave devoted band find themselves holding a lonely outpost while their northern white brothers are bravely scuttling to the rear.\nIf now these southern social radicals look for help to the radical movement in the South they find that movement largely in the hands of demagogues like Blease and Vardaman, and radical on everything except the Negro problem. On that they are reactionary, vindictive, and positively indecent to a degree which is almost inconceivable. A paper like the Harpoon of Austin, Tex., which is supposed to represent exceptional democracy and abolition of privilege, never reaches its prefer depths of vile vituperation until it discusses the Negro, as it does most ot the time, and yet it imagines itself in harmony with the forward movements of the world!\nConsider, then, these five elements: the struggling, emerging Negro, the cowardly white North, the advanced white southern reformers, the Negro hating southern radicals and the reactionary Poes. Can one imagine a more mischief-making combination?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMuddle (1916)\nThe Name Negro (1928)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nToward a New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nUnity (1924)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “Muddle.” The Crisis 8 (3):\n125–26. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/08/04/muddle.html."

    "text": "Is it not singular that so many white folk in advising black folk—and the ancient industry of advising blacks is booming just now—are careful to say, first and last: “Don’t be bitter!” Why is there this insistence on the necessity of a sweet and even temper as an asset in life? Manifestly it is because most Americans who know or who begin faintly to realize the difficulties, complications and insults of a dark man’s life today cannot imagine themselves suffering such wrongs without resorting to dynamite or suicide.\nWith the best will, therefore, they hasten to say: ” Don’t be bitter—don’t mind—look on the bright side—and—and—“—then they trail off helplessly and look you rather miserably and apologetically in the face.\nRecently in Atlanta five hundred colored college students met to consider the student volunteer movement. They had been invited, after several years’ hesitation, by Mr. John R. Mott, who has been making a desperate attempt for twenty-five years to avoid the “Negro Problem” in his missionary enterprises. He found five hundred earnest, thoughtful young people and he selected among others a southern white man to tell them not to be “bitter!” The white man sailed into his task jauntily. He told of the mission of the races—“strength” from one race, “enterprise” from another, “aggression” from a third and from Negroes “submission”—then he looked into one thousand eyes and he paused. The sweat began to ooze out on his forehead and his sentences got mixed. Did he see “bitterness” in those eyes? No! but he did not see submission. “At least,” he stammered, “your fathers and mothers—I don’t know about you all” and he tried a pleasant little interlude which faded to a sickly grin. When at last he sat down even his white friends in the audience knew that he had missed his opportunity. They knew still more when a black man, William Pickens, stood up and with unanswerable logic told Mr. Mott and his friends that Christianity for black men started with the right to vote and nothing less.\nIf our friends mean by bitterness, the futile, impatient gestures of disgust, the wildly boastful word and dumb despair, let them save their advice. Colored Americans are not gesticulating nor yelling, nor committing suicide in numbers large enough to be alarming. But they are looking this nation more and more squarely in the eyes. They are asking in calm, level voice: “How long do you expect to keep up this foolishness and how long do you expect us to submit to it?” That is all. We are just asking. Do you suggest duties for us to attend to? Very good, we shall try to attend to them; we have tried in the past, as you may remember, and we are trying now, as the Census reports prove, but at the same time we keep asking the question: “How long? How much more? What next?” This is what we are doing; if this be bitterness, we are bitter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Gall of Bitterness (1912)\nOptimism (1929)\nOptimism (1927)\nCounsels of Despair (1934)\nEnvy (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “Don’t Be Bitter.”\nThe Crisis 8 (4): 180–81. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/08/04/dont_be_bitter.html."

But again a private letter tells us that the girl was old enough to be ticket seller in a theatre; that she was not injured in the slightest degree, but was found “hale and hearty and singing” the day after; and that, as a matter of fact, the boy was lynched because of his relations with another and older white woman.\nWe have no way of proving these assertions; but they have many ear-marks of truth and their very assertion is an astounding indictment of modern American barbarism. The Crisis knows that Negroes are human and it does not for a moment presume that every Negro accused of a horrible crime is innocent. It wants, and wants for the sake of colored people even more than of others, that colored criminals be treated so as to decrease crime, whatever that treatment may be. It is painfully significant that of all methods of suppressing crime lynching has certainly failed in Shreveport; in that city and parish seven Negroes have been lynched in two years, not counting ordinary murders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLynchings and Mobs (1921)\nLynching (1928)\nLynching (1914)\nPeonage (1916)\nLynchings (1932)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “The Cause of Lynching.”\nThe Crisis 8 (3): 126–27. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/08/03/cause_of_lynching.html."

    "text": "As compared with crap-shooting, always supposed to be the peculiar diversion of Negroes, nine-tenths of the operations of the Wall Street Stock Exchange favors craps, by every consideration of morals and social welfare. Unless the dice are loaded, crap-shooting is a game of pure chance, and the utmost that can happen is the transfer of actual wealth from one gambler to another. But in Wall Street, we have something much more complicated and much less defensible.\nWe have a great gambling pool, forming nine-tenths of a set of operations, of which the remaining tenth is legitimate and under present conditions necessary effort to sell capital to the highest bidder.\nIf the government owned all capital and distributed it by science, reason and welfare, as both Russia and President Hoover are now attempting to do, stock gambling would cease.\nAround this, at present necessary operation, has arisen the habit of open betting on the future profit of the various industries seeking capital. Some of this betting takes the form of buying stock with the object of selling it for a higher price. There is an element of gambling here but it is the necessary gambling of privately owned capital and is as legitimate as crap-shooting.\nBeyond this, however, there is a custom so wide-spread that it involved, during 1928, as high as seven billion dollars of borrowed funds in addition 30 or more billions of owned wealth. This consists of betting on the price of stock without buying it and with only the deposit of enough actual funds to insure the head gambler from sudden loss. It is this dealing in “futures,” that has set the United States crazy for the last few years, taking funds from legitimate industry, depleting thrift accounts and stealing the wages of millions of people; it has made an astonishing number of level-headed Americans dream that they were going to gamble themselves into a financial heaven, where they would subsist on honey and illegal wine, and would sing, dance and do no work forever and forever.\nMoreover, the dice in this gambling are nearly always loaded. Everybody who knew anything knew that they were loaded. The head gamblers know the present value of stocks and the reasonable future values. They deliberately deceive their clients by subtle propaganda to pay unreasonable prices. The President of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury, the heads of great industries, the leaders of social welfare, all knew that stock prices were unreasonably high, yet, for the most part, they were dumb until the crash came. They knew that prices were being paid for part-ownership in industrial enterprises, which were far beyond anything which the enterprise could ever legitimately earn, and yet, they were silent. They listened in silence to a shameless propaganda that explained how a Miracle was happening and that miracle was involved in American financial leadership of the world; that in some magic way values were going to be re-cast so as to make Steel Common worth two or three times what it was really worth by any sane measurement.\nEvery professional gambler in Wall Street, backed by the money distributing power of the Federal Banking System, assured the world that this was so, with the idea of making profit by the gullability of ignorant investors. Every person of ordinary wisdom knew that the crash must come because the market had gone out beyond the steadying influence of real values and depending solely on gamblers’ lies and the gullability of morons.\nJust as there were gamblers who were gambling for a rise, and lied to make it, so there were other gamblers who, as the crest approached, gambled for a fall, and did not spare the truth to bring it about. The result was a crash so stupendous that it shook the world.\nWhat was that crash in its essence? If it had been merely the transfer of money from gambler to gambler, it would have resembled a huge crap game and have been negligible save in its moral results. There would have been the same amount of wealth and work as before and the same number of idle blood-suckers. This is what the New York Times assured us was true after the crash, while President Hoover and Secretary Mellon joined in similar statements.\nBut these were half-truths. For the stock crash was far more than a transfer of hard-earned wealth and thrifty savings from poor people to the gambling rich. It involved destruction of wealth, work and faith—these three and the greatest of these is the Faith, called Credit. We count as wealth today in organized industry not only what we have but what we expect to have; not only what we do but what we plan to do. Destroy plans and overthrow legitimate expectation and industry is sick or dies. Of the great structure of modern time production and space distribution, the actual present goods, the pittance of cash money and the current days work are bagatelles compared with the expected value of goods to be finished, the value which goods now Here will have when they are There. Destroy the faith built on present Work—the Credit reared on present Cash and Goods and you have destroyed wealth and more than wealth.\nThat is the reason the President and Cabinet and millionaires are rushing about and crying all is well when no one knows better than they that all is not well because gamblers have been squandering the nation’s wealth which industry needed and expected.\nThe collapse of the Stock Market was not only loss of capital taken from legitimate industry and sunk and destroyed in wild-cat schemes; it was above all, a shaking of the faith of Americans in American industrial organization and in all private capitalistic enterprise. It was the most tremendous blow to the integrity and efficiency of the capitalistic and privately-owned industry of America which that organization ever received. American capitalism was stabbed in the house of its friends. Nothing that Socialists have said or thought for one hundred years has so openly and crassly pointed out the weakness and injustice of industrial life in America.\nThe end is not yet. The President may repudiate all his individualism and deny the laissez-faire of private enterprise by hurriedly summoning the captains of industry and pleading with them for that co-operation, scientific foresight and submergence of the profit motive which only an efficient State can supply in fullest measure. The fundamental weakness of our system still remains. We are gambling with loaded dice. If gamble we must, we would far better confine ourselves to craps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nInvestments (1921)\nOur Economic Future (1928)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nThe Second Birthday (1912)\nSunny Florida (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1930. “Gambling.” The Crisis 37\n(1): 29–30. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/37/01/gambling.html."

    "text": "There is no universal suffrage in modern industry. So far as the government conducts industry, as in the case of the post office and, in some instances, the transportation system, universal political suffrage indirectly controls the industry. But there are great public services, like the railroad, the telephone, gas and electric lighting, the telegraph and others, where the industry, although public in nature, is private in ownership, and conducted by an autocracy, except insofar as public opinion and the granting of privileges and franchises gives remote control to the voters.\nThe disfranchisement, therefore, of the mass of workers in this case is the most extraordinary and vital disfranchisement in the modern world. When we talk of industrial democracy, we mean the increased right of the working people to determine the policies of great public services, either through direct public ownership or by private negotiation in the shape of shop committees, working agreements and the like.\nWhat is the attitude of the Negro here? Most Negroes would have no attitude at all, so far as public ownership was concerned. They would not be interested; and yet, they are, or should be, tremendously interested. Take, for instance, the telephone service. It is well-nigh universal. The number of telephones in use by colored people runs into the millions. It is not possible that Negroes in the United States spend less than $10,000,000 a year for telephone service, and they may spend three times as much as this. In the organization of work and trade a balance is always assumed between a service rendered or goods delivered on one side and a reciprocal service rendered and goods. delivered, on the other. If the exchange is not direct, it must be indirect, or the whole industrial combination fails. Yet in the case of the colored people and the tele phone, there is no reciprocity. The Telephone Company in the North, almost without exception, employs no colored help whatsoever; no laborers, no telephone girls, no clerks, no officials. The whole service is absolutely closed to Negroes. In the South, a few colored men are employed as laborers and linemen, but not many.\nHere then is a situation where a quasi-public institution absolutely refuses to let millions of citizens earn a decent living, while taxing them along with other citizens for this public service. This compulsory exclusion is, of course, not confined to colored people. It is exercised against Jews; it is exercised against various groups of foreign-born; it is exercised even against certain social classes among American-born citizens. But in the case of the Negroes, we can see it openly, just as in those chemical experiments where an artificially colored liquid reveals diffusion and reaction.\nWhat now must Negroes do? If this sort of thing goes on, then disfranchisement in industry is going to be a vital factor in their elimination from modern civilization. By consolidations and mergers, by holding companies and inter-locking directorates, the great industries of the world are becoming integrated into vast private organizations, which means that the work of the world,—the skilled work, the best paid work,—in the vast majority of the cases, is subject to this social and racial exclusion; to this refusal to allow certain classes of men to earn a decent living.\nIt is an intolerable situation. Attempts have been made to correct it by appeal. In Chicago and in High Harlem, New York, these appeals have been effective in the case of small store chains, and even to a slight extent with a corporation like the Western Union Telegraph Company. But the Telephone Company remains adamant. The Gas Company is absolutely deaf and unsympathetic.\nIn this case there is only one thing to do, and that is for the Negro voters, with intelligence and far-reaching memory, to see that by their votes no further privileges and franchises are granted to these public service companies; and to see that the work of these companies, just as far as possible and as soon as possible, is transferred to the government. Government ownership is the only solution for this present industrial disfranchisement of the Negro.\nThere are, of course, many other reasons and arguments for public ownership beside this personal and racial reason. But all these arguments simply bring home to the mass of people the fact that public service cannot be carried on endlessly for private advantage and private profit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Right to Work (1933)\nCo-Operation (1918)\nForward (1919)\nDisenfranchisement (1925)\nThe Spread of Socialism (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1930. “Economic Disenfranchisement.”\nThe Crisis 37 (8): 281–82. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/37/08/economic_disenfranchisement.html."

Suppose he wants to do something to help the Negroes? What would be the most obvious thing that he could do?\nHe might think of disfranchisement in the South; he might think of lynching, but he certainly would have to think of education. In education, the American Negro has suffered the most vital and damaging and inexcusable discrimination. He was forced by law to be illiterate until Emancipation; and since then the public schools of the South have proceeded to distribute public taxation so that, for instance, in Georgia, where the Negroes form 43 per cent of the population, they get but 9 per cent of the school funds; while $36.29 is expended for each white child a year, only $4.59 is expended for each colored child. In Mississippi, in many counties where the Negro forms three-fourths of the population, less than a $1.00 a year per child is spent on Negro education. In Tunica County, white children receive $63 a year for education and Negroes $4.40. In South Carolina, where a majority of the inhabitants are Negroes, the state spent, 1925–26, $14,673,719, for white schools, and $1,655,652 for Negro schools.\nThis indicates a discrimination so fundamental and so calculated to perpetuate ignorance, crime, prejudice, poverty and disease, that any member of Congress who wishes to save his country might well begin by advocating the appropriation of United States funds to the various states on the basis of illiteracy with the proviso that there should be in its expenditure absolutely no discrimination between the races. If any member of Congress asks for the votes of American Negroes, they should ask him what his record has been on national aid to education without discrimination as to race. If he replies by saying that he supported the appropriations of Land Grant Funds, or the Smith-Hughes or the Smith-Lever Bills, ask him if in these appropriations of public funds for agricultural and technical education, he saw to it that no discrimination between races was to be allowed. As a matter of fact, the discrimination in the administration of these public funds against Negroes is open and notorious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEducation (1911)\nNegro Education (1918)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nEmployment (1932)\nRadicals and the Negro (1925)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1930. “Education.” The Crisis 37\n(2): 65. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/37/02/education.html."

His argument was that lynching has decreased; that a Negro can live his private life as he pleases; that he has freedom in sex, gambling and drinking; that he plays on college athletic teams; that he acts on the stage; intermarries sometimes with whites; sings; publishes recognized books; has big churches; holds public office; shines in the prize ring and at the Bar; is entering the movies; owns land and property; has an increasing number of colleges and college students and less illiteracy; sees the whites getting glory from featuring him; and commits fewer suicides than other folk.\nAll this is encouraging but it is more encouraging to Mr. Nathan than it is to us. As showing progress, it is astonishing; as absolute accomplishment and reasonable goal-reaching, it is nothing to be satisfied about.\nWe see the other side of the shield. We persist in wailing because in 1929 eight Negroes unconvicted of crime by any civilized method, were killed and tortured by mobs. We wail because our children are growing up in ignorance because of discrimination and deliberate perversion of public school funds. We wail at being excluded from public institutions, like libraries, hospitals and parks. We shriek at taxation without representation, and the disfranchisement of nine-tenths of all Negroes living in the South, and of four-fifths of Negroes with education and property; at a system of fraud and force which distorts the whole basis of democratic representation throughout the United States and makes Blease and Heflin our representatives in Congress. We are not satisfied with the present condition of Negro actors and writers. They may, to be sure, entertain Mr. Nathan and other white folk with exhibitions of crude comedy, rude debauchery and sadism; but we conceive Art to be a reflection of life as it is among us and not life as white people conceive it. The every-day truth about the mass of Negro workers is not today written or permitted to be written. We wail because in so many cases where colored people show ability they are silently or openly discriminated against,—kept out of colleges; refused chances for research in laboratories; put out of their place as tennis players, jockeys and baseball players. We wail because the daily newspapers of the United States and the radio corporations refuse by intricate but effective means to let black singers and orators have a place in national competition.\nOur chance for higher training is not one-fourth of what it should be, and seems so large to Mr. Nathan simply because it was once so pitifully small. We own property, but if we had half the property that we have been deliberately cheated out of, we could secure a startling increase of respect from Mr. Nathan and other magazine writers. We work harder than any other class of Americans and we are paid miserably less than a decent living wage. We are the victims of poverty, malnutrition and disease to an extent that surpasses every other group in America, and for this reason we are crowded, pushed and kicked into the jails, and insane asylums.\nWe are not unmindful of our accomplishments and of a significant change in American public opinion. But we know perfectly well that all that we have accomplished is to put our feet upon the path to modern manhood. We are still the only group in civilized American life who can be openly and grossly insulted on the public platform and in newspaper editorials and columns without any effective chance to protest to a sound public opinion; but our encouragement comes from the fact that two generations ago we could be openly murdered upon the streets of New York with even less protest. This is progress. We are encouraged. But even with this before our faces, and with every respect to the American Mercury, We are not going to change our wailing to grinning just yet.\nIn fact, we have a feeling that in times past we have already rather overdone that grinning business. Let’s wail a while.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCauses of Lynching (1931)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\nThe Fruit of the Tree (1913)\nVital Statistics (1912)\nOptimism (1929)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1930. “About Wailing.” The Crisis\n37 (1): 64. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/37/02/about_wailing.html."

He said repeatedly to editors: the colored people of the United States desire to have the word Negro capitalized, and their wishes ought to be respected.\nIt was this argument that brought down the Atlantic Monthly and the New York Times. The Times says: “In our Style Book, Negro is now added to the list of words to be capitalized. It is not merely a typographical change, it is an act in recognition of racial self-respect for those who have been for generations in the `lower case’.”\nThere remains scarcely a respectable periodical in the United States that refuses to capitalize Negro.

    "text": "I met my friend one morning on Seventh Avenue as we were hurrying opposite ways to our work. She asked:\n“Did you attend Smuts lecture?”\nI did not.\nShe said: “He does not strike me as sincere.”\nI quite agreed with her.\nAnd then she said: “You were wise in advocating Pan-Africanism.”\nI thanked her. I was glad that she saw the point. I wished again, as I have often wished, that other people would see it. Here was a statesman from the Union of South Africa. Effort was made before his visit to the United States to commit the colored people to support of him and his policy in order that their action might influence their colored brethren in South Africa. As he was about to arrive, a movement was put on foot to get colored leaders to sign a laudatory address and thank Jans Smuts for his South African Negro program! This was fortunately blocked. Then a quiet conference was arranged in Washington by the Phelps Stokes Fund in which the program was confined to carefully restricted discussion of the American race problem and arranged so as to include no single Negro who had been in South Africa or had expert knowledge of the South African situation.\n\nIn the meantime, however, Mr. Smuts, himself, supplied a good deal of missing information. He had no sooner opened his mouth at Town Hall, New York City, than he put his own foot deeply and completely in it. He compared Negroes to patient asses and wanted them to dance and sing! Negroes have been more patient than most asses and asses do not usually dance and sing. Indeed, the animals that dance and sing best are the least patient with demagogues like Smuts.\nDr. Moton of Tuskegee, who among a half-dozen Negro leaders sat upon the platform, was the only one who had the courage to challenge Smuts then and there. We congratulate him upon the deed.\nSmuts explained. He meant nothing derogative. He was complimenting Negroes. That is Smuts all over! Shrewd, wary, insincere, distrusted throughout South Africa by black and white, Boer and Briton, desperately trying to pose in Europe and America as a great Liberal and forever damned by his determination to keep black folk in eternal subjection to white, while salving the fools with fair words. Herzog, his opponent and the present Premier, is at least sincere. He is as narrow in his “Nigger” hatred as Smuts, but his narrowness is lack of knowledge and not deliberate and suave hypocrisy. Herzog wants to learn. Smuts will never learn. He knows it all now.\n\nAnd he ought to know it. He and his party established the color caste of South Africa in its present form. From the founding of the Union of South Africa until 1924, Smuts has been a member of the Cabinet and often Prime Minister. During this time he helped establish and vigorously defended the following caste system for black men:\n\nDisfranchisement of all persons of Negro descent, except in Cape Colony, and even there Negro voters can not vote for Negro candidates.\nDisarming the natives by excluding them from the militia.\nDepriving natives of their land and prohibiting them from buying land except in restricted areas. This legislation gave a million and a half whites 87 per cent of the land and five million natives 13 per cent.\nExcluding Negroes from the Civil Service.\n“Jim Crow” regulations for railroads and public buildings. There are separate Post Offices for blacks, either at the back of the white Post Office or underground. Even here, no native clerk is employed and natives must take off their hats when entering any public building. In some cases they cannot walk on the sidewalk.\nDirect taxation on natives, at the rate of $5 to $10 a year and using most of this money for the benefit of the whites, who pay no poll tax.\nEducational facilities are so meagre that 95 per cent of the natives are illiterate. In the Transvaal for a long time the government grant native schools was about the same sum as they expended for the upkeep of animals in the Pretoria Zoo.\nThe pass system which compells every native to be registered and carry a pass without which he is subject to arrest and imprisonment.\n\nSome of these regulations do not apply to persons of mixed blood and educated natives not living in tribes, but even for them the caste discrimination and restrictions are humiliating and disgraceful and make South Africa the worst place on earth for colored folk to live.\nConceive what would happen to an Englishman who had treated Irishmen in this way and who came to the United States to lecture? How many Irishmen would be sitting on his platform grinning at him? We certainly are patient asses. We shall never secure emancipation from the tyranny of the white oppressor until we have achieved it in our own souls.\nHow much might have been accomplished for the advantage of Africa and the reputation of American Negroes if we had with quiet dignity refused to sit on Smuts’ platform and to go into conference with him except on the clear understanding that we would be perfectly free to demand from him an explanation of South African conditions and his part in making them. Why was it not perfectly in order for some member of that conference to ask Jan Smuts courteously but firmly why he had deliberately lied at Town Hall and told a questioner that an American Negro could buy land and live in South Africa? Meantime, can not everyone see how necessary it is for persons of Negro descent in all parts of the world to understand their respective problems? How humiliating to see prominent American Negro leaders put themselves in a position to appear as catspaws against the plain wishes and interests of their blood brothers in Africa! The problems of Negroes differ, to be sure, the world over in many intricate and vital respects, but at bottom, they are the same: the political disfranchisement of Negro blood; the distortion of the facts of Negro history and accomplishment; racial discrimination in everyday life; limitation of education so as to increase black serfdom and white profits: “Jim-Crow” policies of all sorts and personal insult based on color of skin.\nThe degree in which these various disabilities are applied differs in different countries and at different times, but they are all present in some degree in every Negro group. It is, therefore, of the greatest importance that these Sroups understand each other; that British Negroes stop criticizing and sneering at American Negroes; that American Negroes realize what British Negroes are accomplishing and enduring; that South Americans and West Indians cease making a white skin their one clear ideal; that African Negroes keep in close touch with their cousins overseas, and that all Negroes look toward the Black World in an effort to be intelligent and thoughtful and helpful in the development of the black folk of all lands.\nThis does not involve in the slightest degree any attempt needlessly and ignorantly to interfere in the government or self-development or self-determination of the different groups or any widespread migration; but it does call for intelligence and co-operation in every possible way and on the broadest scale.\nThis is the deep and unanswerable demand for a Pan-African movement.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Side by side with consumers’ cooperation, and of greater initial importance because it can so easily be put into force, stands the boycott as a weapon which American Negroes can use for their economic defense. Boycotting consists of concerted refusal to trade with a particular store or firm until it meets a group’s wishes in respect to treatment, conditions of work, personnel, prices, etc. In America, it has to be used with care and under careful legal advice because merchants and manufacturers have so hedged themselves about with laws that boycotters may find themselves open to prosecution for interfering with the firm’s profits!\nNevertheless, the method can be and has been widely used. The Consumers’ League has brought pitiless publicity to bear upon firms which mistreat and underpay their employees. And recently, in Chicago, the Chicago Whip, a paper owned and conducted by Negroes, has been carrying on a widespread campaign to compel firms catering to Negro trade in the Chicago black belt to hire Negro clerks.\nThis touches a matter of deep injustice to Negroes. Not only in Chicago, but in practically all large cities, like New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Indianapolis, not to mention all Southern towns and cities, the white storekeepers in the Negro districts monopolize the Negro retail trade, often neglect and even grossly mistreat and cheat their colored customers, and to cap the injustice, hire no colored help. Personal treatment of the colored customer in later years has greatly improved, but with few exceptions, the independent firms and particularly the chain stores, insist on putting white clerks and managers over their black belt stores.\nThis is a double injustice. First and foremost, it cuts down tremendously the opportunities for work among trained colored workers, and secondly, it establishes an impossible economic caste.\nTo combat this, there is one tremendous and most effective weapon. The colored people have a right, after ascertaining the facts, to agree among themselves not to trade with certain stores until they either get better treatment or until the stores hire colored clerks, or until other changes in policy are made. Sometimes, the attack should be directed toward the kind of goods sold in the black belt. It is common custom in New York, for instance, to dump old and spoiled goods in the colored district and sell them at high prices.\nThe success of the campaign carried on by the Chicago Whip has apparently been most encouraging. It began with a survey of the South side business concerns of all types which depend partially or solely upon colored people for support. This showed an easy possibility of openings for seven thousand colored employees in these establishments. After this, an investigator carefully counted the white and colored patrons of the different places in the course of the day for a period of time, until it was possible to determine the volume of colored business. A representative of the newspaper then approached the proprietor. He pointed out the trade that he was getting from colored people; the fact that neither he nor his clerks lived in the district; that they did not deposit their money in colored banks; that they did not patronize colored restaurants; or other colored enterprises. In other words, that they were content to take all and leave nothing.\nThe replies of the merchants were taken down and published by the Whip. The Whip then proceeded to get the aid of churches, clubs, organizations and prominent people, and held monthly meetings. The result of five months of this campaign was that over 400 people secured positions directly through the office of the Whip and some 600 indirectly. “The goal set by the Chicago Whip is five thousand positions before the spring of 1930!”\nThis is but the beginning. Public accommodations, like telephones and street cars, should be attacked. Meter readers for electric light and gas companies should be demanded. Large manufacturers should be confronted with the facts. All this propaganda must have back of it the organized determination of large numbers of colored people to withdraw their patronage from recalcitrant merchants, unless they yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nOur Economic Future (1928)\nDodging the Issue (1933)\nThe Black Man and Labor (1925)\nThe Negro and Labor (1922)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1930. “The Boycott.” The Crisis 37\n(3): 102. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/37/03/boycott.html."

    "text": "How is the Negro disenfranchised? The process is so complicated that few Negroes themselves know definitely. Beginning with 1890 laws have been passed in various Southern states which today disfranchise approximately four million Negroes 21 years of age and over, over half of whom can read and write and who own property which runs into the hundreds of millions. The restrictions by which these have been accomplished are eight in number: 1. Illiteracy: The voter must be able to read and write. 2. Property: The voter must own a certain amount of property. 3. Poll Tax: The voter must have paid his poll tax for the present year or for a series of years. 4. Employment: The voter must have regular employment. 5. Army service: Soldiers in the Civil War and certain other wars, or their descendants, may vote. 6. Reputation: Persons of good reputation who understand the duties of a citizen may vote. 7. “Grandfather” clause: Persons who could vote before the freedmen were enfranchised or descendants of such persons may vote. 8. Understanding clause: Persons may vote who understand some selected clause of the Constitution and can explain it to the satisfaction of the registration officials.\nThe laws are often obscurely drawn and many of them have not had full judicial determination but apparently these restrictions are distributed as follows:\n1890—Mississippi (1 or 8) +3.\n1895—South Carolina 1 or 2 or 8.\n1898—Louisiana (1+2) or 7.\n1901—North Carolina (1+3) or 7.\n1901—Alabama (1+4) or 2 or 5 or 6.\n1902—Virginia (1+3 or 5) or 8 or 2.\n1909—Georgia 1 or 2 or 5 or 6.\nThat is, in Mississippi the voter must be able to read and write or he must understand and explain a section of the Constitution read to him and, in addition to that, he must have paid his poll tax, etc.\nThe Grandfather Clause, No. 7, has been declared unconstitutional but as it was in force for nearly a generation most illiterate white people were able to register under it.\nThe effect of these laws can be illustrated in the case of Louisiana where out of 147,348 colored men 21 years of age and over, of whom 57,000 were reported to be able to read and write, there were in 1908 only 1,743 voters.\nBut all this amounts to nothing as compared with the effect of the White Primary. The White Primary is based on law and custom and is legally the primary election of the Democratic Party. In fact, the Democratic Party admits to this primary any white person who wishes to vote on condition that he pledge himself to stand by the decision of the primary. On the other hand, no Negro is allowed to vote in the White Primary save in exceptional cases. The White Primary therefore becomes the real election and all over the country the newspapers report the results of primary elections in the South as the real decision. When the legal election takes place very few people vote. I lived 13 years in the city of Atlanta where in a population increasing from 100,000 to 200,000 people, usually 700 votes were cast in the legal election.\nIn addition to the power of disfranchisement thus held by the White Primary there is social and economic pressure. Colored men are continually told to keep out of politics or lose their jobs and it has become a point of honor with many Negroes of education and character not to vote nor even to attempt to vote. It is in this way that democratic government is made of no account in a large portion of the United States and it is against this that the N.A.A.C.P. is fighting in its latest judicial case against the White Primary of Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro Voter (1928)\nThe Negro and the Land (1914)\nDisenfranchisement (1926)\nVotes (1919)\nThe Truth (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1925. “Disenfranchisement.”\nThe Crisis 30 (2): 62–63. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/30/02/disenfranchisement.html."

This is saying a great deal, when we remember that in the nineteenth century, Napoleon was overthrown, democracy established in England, Negro slaves emancipated in the United States, the German Empire founded, the partition of Africa determined upon, the Russian Revolution carried through, and two world wars fought. Nevertheless, it is true that the fifteenth of August marks an event of even greater significance than any of these; for on that date four hundred million colored folk of Asia were loosed from the domination of the white people of Europe.\nIt was not a gift nor act of grace. It was forced from the British Empire by the determination of the Indians themselves. Moreover, it was accomplished, not by blood and war, but by peace and grim determination. But for the action of one selfish man, M. A. Jinnah, originally encouraged by the English, there would have been practically no bloodshed in this vast revolution. Even as it is, the number of people killed in India by religious fanaticism during this emancipation is as nothing compared with the millions who fell in the American Civil War, in the Napoleonic Wars, and in two World Wars of Europe and America."

They are mixed descendants of Negroes and Negroids; Mongolians, Western Asiatics, and Eastern Europeans. They vary in color from black to white, and they are divided religiously into one hundred and fifty million Hindus, ninety million Mohammedans, thirteen million Sikhs, Jains and Christians, and many millions of smaller groups. They speak some two hundred and twenty-two languages and dialects.\n\n\n\nA Village Clinic in South India maintained by one of the cotton mill companies.\n\n\nThe Indians are wretchedly poor. Lajpat Rai says: “The people of India are the poorest on earth. If there existed such poverty in any other country in Europe or America, the Government would have been turned out of office.”\nSir William Hunter, one of the most candid writers and a distinguished historian of India, Director-General of Indian statistics for many years, declared that 40,000,000 of the people of India were seldom or never able to satisfy their hunger. It has been calculated that the average Indian family receives not more than twenty-five dollars a year. They are at least 75 per cent illiterate and despite sixteen universities mostly of recent growth there are only fifteen million children in school. All this has been represented as taking place despite the philanthropy of Europe, and especially of England. This is of course a gross misinterpretation of history; it stems from the literary propaganda of which Rudyard Kipling was the especial example, which has led people for decades to picture India as a great and backward country led by powerful, honest and semi-royal whites and represented by a few gorgeously caparisoned Princes with millions of dollars in jewels and income."

    "text": "Early Indian Education\nRev. F.E. Keay, writing on Ancient Indian Education, 1918, says that in the past Indian education was not inferior to the education of Europe, before the Revival of Learning. Not only did the Brahman educators develop a system of education which survived the crumbling of empires and the changes of society, but they also through all these thousands of years, kept aglow the torch of higher learning, and numbered amongst them many great thinkers who have left their mark not only upon the learning of India, but upon the intellectual life of the world.\nWhen Buddhism came, it organized and developed a system of education. The Buddhist system was very much like the Brahmanical system from which it borrowed largely. Some of the Buddhist universities were of enormous size. Their high standards of learning attracted many scholars from China, some of whom have left on record descriptions of these seats of learning. Buddhist education was by no means theological education. The study of medicine received special attention at the Buddhist universities. The Buddhist seats of learning did not shut their doors on any caste or creed. The high caste, the low caste, the Buddhist, the would-be Buddhist, the non-Buddhist were all welcome. The contribution of Buddhist monks to elementary mass education was also considerable. Because of its Buddhist monasteries, practically every male adult in Burma was literate when the British set foot there.\nThe history of India is a story of change and tragedy. Three or four thousand years before Christ, a black people established civilization in the valley of the Ganges and other centers. Upon them descended invaders: Mongolians, from the East; Indo-Europeans from the west: and finally the great Mohammedan incursion in the sixteenth century and later. A fine and striking primitive civilization arose in India upon the black Dravidian foundation; it had a philosophy, a social organization, a splendid art.\nIn India was born, five centuries before Christ, one of the greatest of the world’s religious leaders, usually depicted as black and crisp-haired, Gautama Buddha. He preached a religion of sacrifice and spiritual development. His religion spread over half of the world. From 264 to 227 B.C. arose the great Emperor Asoka whose wheel is pictured on the new flag of India. He began a golden age which lasted a thousand years. After this era, when Indian civilization was one of the greatest in the world, with the Buddhist religion in the lead, there came a series of invasions; the Mongolian horde under Timur from the east; the Mohammedans from the west; invasions all foreshadowed by the incursion of Alexander the Great 327 B.C.\nIn 1525 the great Moguls were reigning and the fame of their wealth and extravagance turned the attention of Europe toward India. From 1556 to 1605 reigned the great Emperor Ak-Bar and the Mohammedan empire glowed and died under his successors during the seventeenth century. By that time the attention of Europe was definitely turned toward India as a source of wealth, and in waves came the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French and finally the British. By the battle of Plassey in 1757 the English became masters of the fate of India. A great English writer Howitt tells of what the Dutch did in India:\n\nTo secure dominion they compelled the princes of Ternate and Tidore to consent to the rooting up of all the clove and nutmeg trees in the island not entirely under the jealous safeguard of Dutch keeping. For this they utterly exterminated the inhabitants of Banda, because they would not submit passively to their yoke. Their lands were divided amongst the white people, who got slaves from other islands to cultivate them. For this Malacca was besieged, its territory ravaged, and its navigation interrupted by pirates; Negapatam was twice attacked; Cochin was engaged in resisting the kings of Calicut and Travancor, and Ceylon and Java were made scenes of perpetual disturbances. These notorious dissensions have been followed by as odious oppressions, which have been practiced at Japan, China, Cambodia, Arracan on the banks of the Ganges, at Achen, Coromandel, Surat, in Persia, at Bassora, Mocha, and other places. For this they encouraged and established in Celebs a system of kidnapping the inhabitants for slaves which converted that island into a perfect hell."

    "text": "Indian Revolts\nFrom the middle of the eighteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth, bloody revolt and oppression was the history of this land. Revolts took place in 1758, 1775, 1782, 1790, 1805, 1814, 1817, 1823, 1837, 1844, 1850 culminating in the great mutiny of 1852. The stench of Indian misgovernment, graft, and theft at last made the British Crown take over the government from the celebrated East India Company. In 1858, India became a part of the British Empire, and in 1877 Victoria was made “Empress of India” by the great Jewish prime minister, Disraeli.\nThis did not stop, rather it began the inner struggle of India for freedom. Governors changed and became more liberal and tried to strive for better conditions in India; but the whole object of the British in India was still to make profit through private investment. And when the government interfered with investment, it simply meant that well-intentioned reforms did not go through. The land became monopolized by money-lenders; industry became subservient to English trade; Indian art and artisanship was driven out of the market; the peasants and laborers became poorer and poorer, and the whole country more and more ignorant. In spite of all the boasting of empire, England with her imperial might lay upon India like a blight.\n\n\n\n“… Mohandas Gandhi, the man who began his fight for freedom in South Africa in behalf of both Indians and Negroes, and who in India began his celebrated strife for peaceful rebellion, non-cooperation and self-rule in 1920.”\n\n\nThe First World War brought matters to a crisis. Beginning in 1917 Great Britain tried to give India a constitution and rights, but arranged them on her own terms without allowing the Indians any voice in drawing up the new constitution. The great result of this effort was Mohandas Gandhi, the man who began his fight for freedom in South Africa in behalf of both Indians and Negroes; and who now in India began his celebrated strife for peaceful rebellion, non-cooperation and self-rule in 1920.\nThe great Indian Congress was organized, one of the most successful voluntary organizations of peoples without rights that the world has ever seen. It stuck together in spite of differences in religion and aim and raised the cry of home rule in 1923. The British replied with elaborate shadow-boxing and propaganda. They called conferences in London, shot down protesters in India, and jailed the leaders, so that of the people now leading India there is not a single one who has not spent months and years in jail for demanding what they now have won in political and social freedom.\nFinally because of the political results and economic complications of the Second World War, Great Britain had to let go; instead of India being in debt to Great Britain, Great Britain was hopelessly in debt to India, because of the raw materials which she had to draw from her during the war. The attitude of the Indian people was such that Great Britain did not dare compulsion. Some elements had even openly fought beside the Japanese. There was and is today wide interest in Russia and in Communism."

    "text": "Divided India\n\n\n\n“… Then the renegade Jinnah, a rich land-holder, raised and pressed the religious question and succeeded in temporarily dividing India on the basis of Hinduism and Mohammedanism”\n\n\nVarious gestures were made, the first brought by Cripps was rejected by the Indians; then the renegade Jinnah, a rich land-holder raised and pressed the religious question and succeeded in temporarily dividing India on the basis of Hinduism and Mohammedanism. Out of that, among the poor and ignorant, rose fanatical fighting among neighbors who had lived in peace for centuries. But the great Indian leaders were not to be diverted or mislead. They decided wisely to accept freedom, even though it meant for the present a divided India. This division into Pakistan and the Union of India cannot stand, because Pakistan is an agricultural country, divided by the great triangle of India; unless then it can find support in Europe, which it cannot for long, it must depend upon India for industry which means that economic pressure will compel it to be one with the great sub-continent. So too the princely states will resist but succumb.\n\nIt is true that all will not go well with India. It is a difficult—a herculean task which this new nation undertakes. First of all, there are social problems; the education of a country which is vastly ignorant and needs all sorts of education; there is the health problem among a people decimated by tropical disease, malnutrition and lack of clothing and shelter.\n\n\n\nJawaharlal Nehru, prime minister in the new Indian government, is next to Gandhi the most important man in India. One of the architects of Indian freedom, he has, like the Mahatma, spent many of his years in prison.\n\n\nThere is above all the problem of poverty; there is going to be increasingly a fierce struggle between the great Indian capitalists representing the tuition and the capital of Europe, and the mass of workers who have been ground down to the last degree of poverty and ill-health.\nAll of that drama of the rights of labor, which has been fought out in Europe and America, must be begun and struggled through in India. Then of course there is the problem of religion; age-old beliefs and superstitions, exacerbated by the Jinnah political program of throwing two great religions into difficult and bitter political competition. Nothing but an India-wide crusade against religious dogma will win here in the end. It must and will be undertaken.\nFinally there is the whole problem of political power: the overall power of the state, the division of powers among the provinces; the question of votes and elections, and the various law-making bodies; all this portends for India a terrible and long struggle. But there is in this new land, certain great advantages. They have a spiritual faith; a belief in the inner value of the human being as differing from and transcending the matter of wealth and material things. Indian philosophy and religion has influenced the world in this respect in the past; it will in the future. It may become dominant even over Europe, which measures everything in terms of profit.\nAmerican Negroes, particularly, have every reason to hail the new and free India. It is a freedom and autonomy of colored folk; it ends the day in a whole continent, when the white man by reason of the color of his skin, can lord it over colored people; when he can bring his segregation and his cheap habits of superiority, as shown by exclusive clubs, “jim-crow” cars and saloons and the other paraphernalia of disgraceful human degradation. The sun of the colored man has arisen in Asia as it will yet rise in Africa and America and the West Indies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Durbar (1912)\nIndia (1930)\nA Pageant (1915)\nWest Indian Immigration (1924)\nResistance (1914)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In Detroit, Michigan, a black man has shot into a mob which was threatening him, his family, his friends and his home in order to make him move out of the neighborhood. He killed one man and wounded another.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nImmediately a red and awful challenge confronts the nation. Must black folk shoot and shoot to kill in order to maintain their rights or is this unnecessary and wanton bloodshed for fancied ill? The answer depends on the facts. The Mayor of Detroit has publicly warned both mob and Negroes. He has repudiated mob law but he adds, turning to his darker audience, that they ought not to invite aggression by going where they are not wanted. There are thus two interpretations:\n\nA prosperous Negro physician of Detroit, seeking to get away from his people, moves into a white residential section where his presence for social reasons is distasteful to his neighbors.\nA prosperous Negro physician of Detroit, seeking a better home with more light, air, space and quiet, finds it naturally in the parts of the city where white folk with similar wants have gone rather than in the slums where most of the colored are crowded.\n\nWhich version figures: is true? See the figures:\n\nNegro Population of Detroit\n\n\n\n1900\n\n&lt;td&gt;4,111&lt;/th&gt;\n\n\n\n1910\n\n\n5,741\n\n\n\n\n1920\n\n\n40,838\n\n\n\n\n1925\n\n\n60,000 (estimated)\n\n\n\nTwo thirds of this population in 1920 were crowded into three wards—the Third, Fifth and Seventh. Meantime the total population of Detroit has more than doubled in ten years and the people have reached out on all sides to new dwelling places. Have the Negroes no right to rush too? Is it not their duty to seek better homes and, if they do, are they not bound to “move into white neighborhoods” which is simply another way of saying “move out of congested slums”?\nWhy do they not make their own new settlements then? Because no individual can make a modern real estate development; no group of ordinary individuals can compete with organized real estate interests and get a decent deal. When Negroes have tried it they have usually had miserable results; in Birmingham, Alabama, twenty years since, they bought a nice street and lined it with pretty homes; the city took all its prostitutes and stuck them into a segregated vice district right behind the pretty homes! In Macon, Savannah, New Orleans and Atlanta crime and prostitution have been kept and protected in Negro residence districts. In New York City, for years, no Negro could rent or buy a home in Manhattan outside the “Tenderloin”; and white Religion and Respectability far from stretching a helping hand turned and cursed the blacks when by bribery, politics and brute force they broke into the light and air of Harlem. Some great leaders in Negro philanthropy like Clarence Kelsey formed a financial bloc to push the Negroes out of Harlem, to refuse mortgages to landlords renting to them; but only one practical project of furnishing them decent quarters came to fruition.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDear God! Must we not live? And if we live may we not live somewhere? And when a whole city full of white folk led and helped by banks, Chambers of Commerce, mortgage companies and “realtors” are combing the earth for every decent bit of residential property for whites, where in the name of God can we live and live decently if not by these same whites? If some of the horror-struck and law-worshipping white leaders of Detroit instead of winking at the Ku Klux Klan and admonishing the Negroes to allow themselves to be kicked and killed with impunity—if these would finance and administer 2 decent scheme of housing relief for Negroes it would not be necessary for us to kill white mob leaders in order to live in peace and decency. These whited sepulchres pulled that trigger and not the man that held the gun.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBut, wail the idiots, Negroes depress real estate values! This is a lie—an ancient and bearded lie. Race prejudice decreases values both real estate and human; crime, ignorance and filth decrease values. But a decent, quiet, educated family buying property in a decent neighborhood will not affect values a bit unless the people in that neighborhood hate a colored skin more than they regard the value of their own property. This has been proven in a thousand instances. Sudden fall in values comes through propaganda and hysteria manipulated by real estate agents or by Southern slave drivers who want their labor to return South; or by ignorant gossip mongers. Usually Negroes do not move into new developments but into districts which well-to-do whites are deserting. The fall in values is not due to race but to a series of economic readjustments and often, as in Baltimore, real estate values were actually saved and raised, not lowered, when black folk bought Druid Hill Avenue and adjacent streets. Certainly a flood of noisy dirty black folk will ruin any neighborhood but they ruin black: property as well as white, and the reason is not their color but their condition. And whom, High Heaven, shall we blame for that?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBut these facts make no difference to organized American Negro haters. They are using every effort to maintain and increase race friction. In the South time and time again communities have almost forgotten race lines until the bitter, hate-preaching liar stirred it up again. The whole present “Anglo-Saxon” and “race purity” agitation in Virginia has arisen because one white family openly acknowledged its colored grandmother! The whole crusade in Detroit has come to a head because, in 1920, 663,000 Southern whites had migrated and were living in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Their numbers are swelling. They are largely clerks, artisans and laborers, not illiterate but ignorant of the modern world and forming by habit the lawless material of mobs. They are ruining the finer democracy of the Middle West and using the Negro as an excuse.\nWhat shall we do? I know a black man. He is a professional man and a graduate of a great eastern school. He has studied abroad. His wife was educated in a good western school and is a quiet housewife. His son is a college graduate and a high school teacher. They have never been arrested. They conduct themselves as cultured folk. This man is living in an apartment in Harlem. He would like more air and sunlight and less noise. He would like a new, small, modern house in the further Bronx or in the hills of Westchester or New Jersey or in the higher part of Queens. He sees daily in the papers new homes advertised suitable to his means—$500, $1,000 even $2000 down, the rest as rent. Can he buy one of these? Not without plotting, deception, insult or murder.\nFor instance: A man bought a modest home in Staten Island. He was a mail carrier with a fine record; his wife was a school teacher, educated and well-bred. They had four sturdy children in school. As a result he has been mobbed and insulted, his property injured, his glass and shrubbery broken, his insurance cancelled, his life threatened, his existence made miserable. His neighbors do everything to insult him and his, even to crossing the street to avoid passing him. He sticks to his home even though offered a profit to sell, “on principle.” He is “colored.”\nAnother man in Detroit bought a fine home in a former exclusive district which is now changing. He was a physician with a large practice, the founder of a hospital, public-spirited and well-liked. He had married the daughter of perhaps the greatest of the interpreters of Negro folk songs with world-wide reputation. He moved in. A mob of thousands appeared, yelling and cursing. They broke his windows, threw out his furniture and he and his family escaped under police protection. He gave up his home, made no resistance, moved back whence he came, filed no protest, made no public complaint. He was “colored.”\nA little later another physician in Detroit bought another beautiful home and moved in. A mob—almost the same mob—came, cursed, threw stones and ordered him to move. He gathered his family and friends within and locked the door. Five or six thousand people lined the streets. The police set traffic officers to divert the traffic that could not get through. The mob invaded his yard and approached his doors. He shot and shot to kill. His wife and his friends are now in jail charged with Murder in the first degree! He was “colored.”\nGentle Reader, which of these three examples shall my friend of Harlem follow? Which would you follow if you were “free,” black and 21?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Soldier (1920)\nCrime (1920)\nMob Tactics (1927)\nBleeding Ireland (1921)\nLynchings and Mobs (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1925. “The Challenge of Detroit.”\nThe Crisis 31 (1): 7–10. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/31/01/challenge_of_detroit.html."

    "text": "Two significant movements have recently taken place among us. The Pullman Porters are organizing a trade union and the colored Communists have met in Chicago. Both movements have found opposition and from the same source. So intelligent and skilled a group of men as the Pullman porters ought to have long since adopted collective bargaining with their employers. But the Pullman company and other white capitalists have discouraged this with threats and propaganda and lately they have hired a silly black lawyer, who holds a small job in Washington, to help them.\nWhy is this? It is because since the days of slavery the black laborer has been allied with the white capitalist. Since emancipation he has been bribed by philanthropy so that he thinks the thoughts of the rich, the powerful, the employing class. At the same time he has been kicked out of the major part of the white labor movement and his resultant resentment has helped his alignment with capital. Today he is beginning to awake. The Pullman porters are going to have a union.\nBut beyond that if black men wish to meet and learn what laborers are doing in England or in Russia and sympathize with these movements they have a perfect right to do so; it is unjust of white men and idiotic of colored men to criticize the attempt. We should stand before the astounding effort of Soviet Russia to reorganize the industrial world with open mind and listening ears. Russia has not yet failed and Negroes must not swallow all the lies told about her. She may yet show the world the Upward Path. The Crisis does not know the persons back of the Chicago convention, but it asserts the right of any set of American Negroes to investigate and sympathize with any industrial reform whether it springs from Russia, China or the South Seas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPullman Porters (1927)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nThe Negro and Labor (1922)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nEugene Debs (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1925. “The Black Man and Labor.”\nThe Crisis 31 (2): 60. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/31/02/black_man_and_labor.html."

    "text": "Broken Bow, Nebraska.\n\nAs president of a woman’s club I am writing you for information in regard to your views on race assimilation, intermarriage of Negroes and whites. We have just completed a two weeks’ study of your book “Souls of Black Folk” and are unable to arrive at a definite conclusion as to your attitude toward this question. I am asking you to please let me know your honest convictions along this line and greatly oblige,\n  Dr. Elizabeth Leonard\n\n\n69 Fifth Ave., New York.\n\nI believe that from time to time the groups of human beings, which we call races, assimilate and again differentiate. No race is permanent in its physical or mental characteristics.\nI believe that individuals usually will find the greatest happiness and the greatest chance to do their best work if they marry within their own racial group. There are, of course, exceptions to this and many marriages between persons of different races have turned out happily. But usually, for obvious reasons, marriages within the group are most likely to be happy.\nDespite the above I maintain the perfect right of any individual of any race, who is sane and normal, to marry the person who wishes to marry him. Any denial of this fundamental right of human intercourse always results in more evil than the denial seeks to prevent.\nSpecifically and in regard to the intermarriage of Negroes and whites in the United States, I believe that when any group is disliked and ostracized, for historical and other reasons, its self-respect demands that it seek to minimize as far as possible any intermarriage with the group that assumes superiority.\nFinally, I have no doubt that in large numbers of cases groups of persons working together and intermarrying have been enabled to make peculiar contributions to civilization and to preserve and hand down these gifts; and any group that has done this or wishes to do it has a right to confine its marriages to its own members so far as it does not seek also to insult or degrade other groups or deny them the same rights.\n\nW.

    "text": "The New South of Henry Grady had nothing new for the Negro. And since that time thoughtful Negroes have received professions of friendship on the part of the white South with much salt. Nor can they be blamed for this: lynching, “Jim-Crow” cars, poor schools, segregation and insult form a difficult atmosphere in which to breathe the air of freedom, friendship and hope. But there can be no doubt but that the white South is changing; there is nothing revolutionary as yet, but leaven is working. Today as never before since 1863 there can be found in the white South a few intelligent and determined people who are willing to recognize black men as men—not as Super-men nor as morons, but as men. This group is not large; in no community is it in majority; only here and there is it self-conscious and vocal. But it exists and it is slowly growing in numbers and courage.\nMay we note a few evidences? Most of the circular matter sent out from the Atlanta headquarters of the Inter-racial movement is pure pro-Southern propaganda; but not all of it. Recently a resumé of Negro progress by Robert B. Eleazer was issued which was complete, sympathetic and beyond criticism. A Negro, Silas Parmore, extradited from New Jersey to Georgia over our protest, was tried and acquitted; and not only this but the Governor Walker, of Georgia, boasted of the fact. Mississippi is the nadir of the South; she murders, disfranchises and enslaves her labor; she has neither literature, science nor art; no actor, singer or lecturer of note thinks of stopping there; only 90 of the 2 million residents of the state are in “Who’s Who” and 26 of these because of positions they were elected to; the state has lynched and burned alive over 530 human beings in the last generation. Yet Mississippi this year for the first time in her history has issued a protest against lynching signed &gt; by Governor H. L. Whitfield, Speaker Thomas L. Bailey, of the House of Representatives, President J. N. Flowers, of the State Bar Association, a number of judges of the Supreme Court, members of Congress, prominent lawyers, educators, churchmen, and club women. Prominent place is given also to the recent anti-lynching statement made by the Mississippi Woman’s Committee on Interracial Cooperation, which has since been affirmed by hundreds of Mississippi women at meetings throughout the State. &gt;  \n&gt; An important section of the pamphlet is given to suggestions for the prevention of lynching, Sheriffs are urged to announce in advance that they expect to do their duty in every case, even at the risk of their own lives; to employ as deputies only those persons who agree to go to the same length in upholding the law; to ascertain the names of men who are opposed to mob violence and to swear these in as special deputies at the first sign of trouble; to remove to the jails of other counties prisoners threatened with mob violence; and to call upon the Governor to order out the National Guard if needed; &gt;  \n&gt; The popular fallacy regarding the ‘usual cause’ of lynchings is also mercilessly exposed. Photographs of a recent lynching are shown and ‘respectfully referred to the next Grand Jury’. &gt;  \n&gt; State officials, members of the Bar Association, and other prominent people are distributing the pamphlet widely and are offering medals in each congressional district for the best essays on the subject by high school students.\nIn Kentucky the Inter-racial movement has ceased to be simply a method of stopping agitation by encouraging “white folk’s nigger” and seems to be trying really to attack certain pressing problems of race contact; North Carolina is resolutely facing the problem of Negro education and has established a class A college. Roland Hayes has been heard by mixed audiences in Richmond, Louisville and Atlanta. A colored girl elected to represent the South in a national student organization was not displaced when the fact of her race was known.\nBut all those symptoms are of but passing significance except as they indicate these fundamental changes:\nFirst, the definite breaking up of the effort of the South to present morally and socially a solid front to the world. The South is beginning to realize that the fight for righteousness in its borders as elsewhere in the world cannot conceal itself behind the apparent absolute agreement of all southern whites on the Negro problems. Until the Better South is willing openly and flatly to take a stand and to fight the Bourbon race reactionaries, they will find themselves circumvented and represented by the Worst South. There are signs that a few Southerners, and especially the younger men and women, are realizing this and are prepared to pay the heavy price.\nSecondly, just as the South has hitherto heard with sympathetic and even exaggerated patience and respect the demands of extreme white Southern Negro haters, so too they must be willing now to listen to Negro “radicals.” To read out of the congregation of decent, reasonable and law-abiding people those black folk who demand the ballot, equal education, the abolition of “Jim Crow” legislation, the abrogation of laws and customs which protect and encourage bastardy and prostitution, and right of social equals to social equality with those who wish it—to lynch such men morally is a coward’s trick and a scoundrel’s subterfuge and there are southern white men today who realize this as never before. To such men and to such women in the dawn of the nineteen hundred and twenty-sixth year of the Prince of Peace, our hand and heart, comrades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLight (1912)\nThe Newest South (1913)\nBrothers, Come North (1920)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nThe Unfortunate South (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “The Newer South.”\nThe Crisis 31 (4): 163–65. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/31/04/newer_south.html."

    "text": "There are some things connected with the fight of Pullman porters for recognition as modern working men which should hold our attention. First, there is the threat of the Pullman Company to substitute Filipino porters. This threat is sheer poppycock. Let them import as many Filipinos as they want. The Negro porters can easily hold their own. But of course the Pullman Company has not the slightest intention of importing Filipinos even if they could do so legally. They are simply trying to scare colored men.\nThen again they are trying to influence the Negro press and apparently they are succeeding. Of the five or more colored papers in Chicago not a single one has come out openly and fearlessly in defense of the porters. Most of them have treated the matter with shuffling and with silence.\nBut it is perhaps the attitude of Calvin Coolidge and his government which is most disgraceful. The government has not only set spies to hound Negroes who dare to study Communism, but it has allowed one of its own job-holders to accept a fee from the Pullman Company in return for throwing dirt and bribes among Negroes. As the Brooklyn Daily Eagle says: “Coercion of labor unions by paid agents of employers holding Federal office is not capable of any defense, certainly of none that has any relation to practical politics in America.”\nFinally, if American Negroes want to know on which side to take their stand in this matter of labor organization among Negroes they should note the people who are against it: Mark Sullivan, the most unfair of newspaper correspondents on Negro problems, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, the daily press of Miami, Florida! When such forces as these take one side, it is the business of thinking Negroes to take the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPullman Porters (1927)\nThe Black Man and Labor (1925)\nAgain, Pullman Porters (1926)\nThe Present (1917)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “Pullman Porters.”\nThe Crisis 31 (3): 113. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/31/03/pullman_porters.html."

    "text": "The Assistant Secretary of the N.A.A.C.P. “Covered” the Trial of the Negroes of Detroit Who Were Tried for Murder Because They Defended Their Home Against a Mob\nAt half-past three in the afternoon of the day before Thanksgiving, Judge Frank Murphy of the Recorder’s Court of Detroit finished reading his charge to the jury and turned over to that body for decision the now famous case of The People of the State of Michigan vs. Ossian H. Sweet et al.\nSeldom in any court has a more impartial, learned or complete charge to a jury been heard. As was evidenced throughout the case, Judge Murphy was exerting every effort at his command to assure to the eleven defendants a completely fair trial. His charge to the jury reached its dramatic climax when in a voice filled with emotion and sincerity, he declared:\n\nDr. Sweet has the same right under the law to purchase and occupy the dwelling house on Garland Avenue as any other man. Under the law, a man’s house is his castle. It is his castle, whether he is white or black, and no man has the right to assail or invade it. The Negro is now by the Constitution of the United States given full citizenship with the white man and all the rights and privileges of citizenship attend him wherever he goes.\n\nThe jury retired. All afternoon and far into the night anxious crowds thronged the court room and the corridors without. From the jury room could be heard the muffled voices of the jury raised in anger but the door remained closed. Shortly after midnight, a message was sent to Judge Murphy asking for further instructions. Out came the jury with haggard faces and listened to Judge Murphy as he re-read the parts of his charge referring to justifiable self-defense.\nBack into the jury room filed the twelve men. Again voices were heard in argument. At 2:15 Thanksgiving morning, Judge Murphy summoned the jury to permit them to go to bed. The court room was so crowded that court attendants had to use force in getting enough space in front of the judge’s dais to permit the jury to stand. Ninety-five per cent of the crowd was composed of Negroes, hope and fear and apprehension and questioning in their faces, asking if justice could be secured for eleven black defendants in a white man’s court and at the hands of a white judge and a white jury.\nEarly on Thanksgiving morning, the jury resumed its deliberations. All day long the court room remained full, hundreds of people going without Thanksgiving dinner for fear that the jury’s verdict might be rendered when they were away eating. Towards midnight of the second day, the jury, yet deadlocked, was allowed to retire.\nAt 1:30 in the afternoon of November 27th, the jury sent word again to Judge Murphy that there was no hope of their reaching a decision. At the end of forty-six hours of deliberation, Judge Murphy declared a mistrial and thanked and dismissed the jurors.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThus ended the first trial of the case which has stirred Negro America as no other case has ever moved it. Within fifteen years, the Negro population of Detroit has been multiplied by ten, jumping from eight thousand in 1911 to 81,831 by 1925 as a result of the stoppage of immigration from Europe and increased activity on the part of Northern industries. Negroes during and after the war worked in the plants of Detroit, made money and saved it. As has been said many times, it is obvious that eighty-one thousand people cannot live in the homes which housed eight thousand people thirteen years ago. Since 1916 there has been gradual and necessary penetration by Negro home buyers of neighborhoods which hitherto have been occupied by white people. There has been practically no trouble attendant upon these so-called “invasions” until the last year or two. People in Detroit have been so busy earning money that they have not had time to nourish and develop racial or other prejudices. With the exception of a few minor clashes, Detroit has been without doubt one of the fairest cities in the country so far as its treatment of Negroes is concerned.\nAbout two years ago, the Ku Klux Klan started a campaign to capture control of Detroit. This was a part of the movement to gain control of that city and, that purpose gained, make similar efforts to gain control of other Northern cities based upon success in Detroit. Whether a part of that campaign or not, fully ninety per cent of the policemen who have gained positions on the Detroit police force during the past two years have been Southern whites. Charles Bowles, an obscure attorney, was put up as the Klan candidate for Mayor. A little more than a year ago, he secured as the result of Klan support approximately one hundred thousand votes in a mayoralty primary, his name being written in on the ballots. In 1925, he was again a candidate, running against the present incumbent, John W. Smith, who is a Catholic. In the campaign which ended in November, out of approximately a quarter of a million votes, Bowles was defeated by Smith by a narrow margin of about thirty thousand votes.\nIn order to gain this strength, the Klan has capitalized and stirred up bitter racial and religious animosities. Early in 1925 there began a series of attacks on the homes of Negroes which reached its most serious stage up to that time in the attack last June upon the home of Dr. A. L. Turner, a respected Negro physician of Detroit. Dr. Turner was driven out of his house, forced to sign an agreement to sell his newly acquired home on Spokane Avenue, his furniture smashed, and he and Mrs. Turner attacked by the mob as they drove away.\nPractically nothing was done by the police to prevent this attack.\nDr. Ossian H. Sweet, a young Negro physician who is a graduate of Wilberforce and Howard Universities and who has done post-graduate work in pediatrics and gynecology at the Universities of Vienna and Paris, bought a home on Garland Avenue last May. Because of threats against him, Dr. Sweet deferred moving into his new house for two months and a half. He did move in on September 8th, the day after Labor Day. That night a mob gathered but no attack was made on the house. The following evening a larger crowd gathered and stoned the house. In the excitement shots were fired and one member of the mob fell dead and one was wounded.\nPolice officers, including a deputy superintendent of police, an inspector, a lieutenant, a sergeant, and eight officers, were galvanized into action. They rushed into the house, arrested Dr. Sweet, his wife, Mrs. Gladys B. Sweet, mother of a fourteen months old baby, and nine other occupants of the house. In September, the eleven defendants were given a preliminary hearing before the late Judge John Faust. All were held without bail charged with murder in the first degree.\nAfter remaining in jail for a month, Mrs. Sweet was finally released on bail. In her early twenties, weighing but little more than a hundred pounds, a well educated and intelligent young woman, certain elements in Detroit felt that she was so grave a menace to society that a number of threats were made against the judge for releasing her on bail. From this may be learned the intensity of feeling against the eleven defendants.\nThe N.A.A.C.P., realizing the very great issue involved and feeling that this case represented the dramatic high point of the nation-wide issue of segregation, entered the case, throwing all of its resources without stint into the defense. If the right of a Negro to defend his home against a mob is to be denied him, the N.A.A.C.P. felt that very grave consequences would follow. It was felt also that a successful defense would serve notice upon members of other mobs that decent white and colored people throughout the country had determined to put an end to the unwarranted attacks which had been made with impunity by other mobs upon the persons and property of Negroes. Again, a completely fair trial to Dr. and Mrs. Sweet and their co-defendants would give hope to Negroes throughout the country that their lot was not as hopeless as it sometimes appears to be.\nFor these reasons, the N.A.A.C.P. retained the most eminent array of counsel which, according to the general consensus of opinion, had ever been engaged for a trial in any Michigan court. Clarence Darrow of Chicago, generally regarded as the greatest criminal lawyer in America and perhaps in the world, was secured as chief counsel. Mr. Darrow, because of his great interest in the case and because of his broad humanitarianism, agreed to serve at a fee which was approximately one-tenth of what he would ordinarily receive in a case of this magnitude. Mr. Arthur Garfield Hays of New York, one of the eminent criminal attorneys of America who was associated with Mr. Darrow in the famous Evolution Case at Dayton, Tennessee, agreed also to enter the case at a nominal fee. Other attorneys secured were Mr. Walter M. Nelson, a prominent white attorney of Detroit, and Messrs. Julian Perry, Cecil Rowlette and Charles Mahoney, colored attorneys of Detroit. Mr. Herbert J. Friedman of Chicago volunteered his services and assisted in the trial without fee.\nThe trial began on October 30th. At the very outset, Mr. Hays demanded and secured a Bill of Particulars. Prosecutor Robert M. Toms thereupon filed a Bill which particularized as follows:\n\nThe theory of the people in this case is that the defendants premeditatedly and with malice aforethought, banded themselves together and armed themselves with the common understanding and agreement that one or more of them would shoot to kill, in the event, first, of threatened or actual trespass on the property wherein they were assembled, or, second, of the infliction of any damage, real or threatened, however slight, to the persons or property of them or any of them. Further, that deceased came to his death by a bullet fired by one of the defendants, aided and abetted by all of the others, in furtherance of their common understanding as above set forth. Further, that such understanding and agreement was to commit an unlawful act, to wit, to shoot to kill without legal justification or excuse.\n\nThe purpose in demanding this Bill of Particulars was to force the State to confine its testimony to the proving of a specific thing rather than permit the State to Maintain at the conclusion of the trial that it had set out to prove whatever it had happened to prove during the trial.\nThrough nearly three weeks the State put on its witnesses. Man after man, woman after woman, went on the stand and declared that there were only twelve ~ fifteen people around the Sweet home on the night of September 9th. The contentions of these witnesses as to the number of persons actually present was somewhat amusing inasmuch as the State in filing names and addresses of the witnesses it intended to call listed seventy-one eye-witnesses to the shooting. The purpose of the testimony giving the figures of bystanders at so low a figure can be understood from the fact that the Michigan law provides that a mob consists of “twelve or more persons armed with clubs or other dangerous weapons or of thirty or more persons armed or unarmed.”\nThe State’s case began to crumble under the cross-examination of Mr. Darrow and Mr. Hays. For example, Dwight Morrow, a prosecution witness, was asked by Mr. Toms what he saw at Garland and Charlevoix Avenue on the night of September 9th. Morrow answered: “Well, there were—a great number of people and the officers—I won’t say a great number—there were a large—there were a few people there and the officers—”\nUnder cross-examination by Mr. Darrow, this statement was recalled to Morrow’s attention. Mr. Darrow asked Morrow:\nQ. “You kind of forgot you were to say a few people, didn’t you when you started in?”\nA. “Yes, Sir” …\nAgain, Norton Schuknecht, Inspector of Police in charge of the Fifth Precinct, testified that he on the night of September 9th was standing at the corner of Charlevoix and Garland Avenues which location was in his precinct. Inspector Schuknecht testified there were no crowds congregated nor any disturbance but that there were around seventy-five people near Dr. Sweet’s house, but he also declared that he had found it necessary to station two traffic officers near the house to divert traffic. Several days later, Deputy Superintendent of Police Sprott testified that he was present also on September 9th, that there were no people around the house, that there were four traffic officers and that he had stationed them there. These are but a few of the many contradictions on the part of prosecution witnesses which were brought out through cross-examination by the defense attorneys. By the time that the prosecution’s testimony was in, it was clearly evident that there was a large crowd present and the prosecution itself introduced a number of stones which were taken from the inside and the roof of the Sweet home.\nAt the close of the prosecution’s case, a motion was made by the defense for a directed verdict inasmuch as the State had wholly failed to prove the conspiracy which it had set forth to prove according to its Bill of Particulars. Judge Murphy denied the motion but granted the right to the defense to renew the motion at the conclusion of the presentation of the defense testimony.\nDefense witnesses were then placed on the stand. A number of them told of the threats made against Dr. Sweet and Mrs. Smith from whom Dr. Sweet had purchased the house and of the actual attack upon the house. Four colored witnesses, who happened to be driving in the vicinity of the Sweet home on the night in question and who were attacked and beaten by the mob when they unwittingly drove near the Sweet home, told of their experiences.\nThe dramatic climax of the trial was reached when Dr. Ossian H. Sweet himself was placed on the stand. Over the objection of the prosecution, the entire background of Dr. Sweet was entered into the record. He told of his birth in a small Florida town, of his leaving home at the age of fourteen to go to Wilberforce University, of his arrival there only to find that the Scholarship Fund through which he had hoped to get an education had been exhausted. Simply, directly and convincingly, Dr. Sweet told of his efforts to gain an education. He told of the years he had worked as a bell boy, shoveling snow, waiting table, firing furnaces and at the same time carrying on his studies until he had finished the academic and college courses at Wilberforce. He then related how he had worked his way through Howard University Medical School and, though he was without funds, he had determined to go to Europe and there pursue his studies at the Universities of Vienna and Paris.\nHe told, too, how during a campaign for funds by the American Hospital at Paris he had given what he could to that hospital—some three hundred francs—a gift which meant certain privations for himself and wife; and then later when he made application for Mrs. Sweet to enter that hospital to give birth to a daughter, how she had been denied admission because of the colored blood within her veins.\nThen there were brought out the things which had most definitely influenced Dr. Sweet’s mind in its reactions toward American mobs. A race riot a few years ago at Orlando, Florida, where Dr. Sweet was born, in which several colored people were killed and the homes of a number of Negroes burned; of the Tulsa riot in 1921 when Dr. Jackson, eminent Negro surgeon, was shot and killed in cold blood after he had been guaranteed protection by the police force; of the Phillips County, Arkansas, Riots in 1919 when the four Johnson brothers, one of them a physician and another a dentist, had been ambushed through treachery and killed; of the Washington race riots in 1919 when Dr. Sweet had seen a colored man dragged from a street car and beaten to death; of the Chicago race riots of that same year when a cousin of Mrs. Sweet, a police officer, had been forced to go to trial when he in clear self-defense had killed a member of the mob which was attacking him; of the terrible riots at East St. Louis in 1917. All of these things were brought out through adroit questioning to show the state of mind of the eleven Negroes within the house on the night of September 9th at 2905 Garland Avenue, Detroit. As Mr. Darrow pointed out convincingly to the court, the theory of a reasonable man as propounded by the State could not possibly mean in this case the attitude of a white man but must necessarily be that of a Negro with a white mob outside and in the Negro’s brain a picture of what similar mobs have done to Negroes during the last sixty years in America.\nBy the time the case was ready to go to the jury, it was freely predicted throughout Detroit that the case could not possibly end in anything other than acquittal for all eleven defendants. The newspapers of Detroit gave full and impartial reports of the trial, for thirty days featuring the story on the front page. As a result of this impartial reporting, the decent and fair minded element in Detroit had been informed to such an extent that sympathy had swung definitely toward the defendants—a very marked contrast to feeling in the city prior to the entry of the N.A.A.C.P. and Mr. Darrow into the case.\nOn the other hand, the anti-Negro sentiment, and especially that represented by such organizations as the Ku Klux Klan and the Waterworks Park Improvement Association which had been formed for the purpose of keeping Dr. Sweet from occupying his home, definitely became very bitter as the case went on. Because of the feeling on the part of the two groups just mentioned, it is reasonably certain that all eleven defendants would have been convicted had it not been for the work of the attorneys engaged and the efforts of the N.A.A.C.P. both in retaining these attorneys and in conducting the case and in the efforts of the N.A.A.C.P. in placing before the people of Detroit the actual facts in the case to displace the half truths and untruths which had stirred such hostility against the defendants.\nThe case has cost the N.A.A.C.P. upwards of $20,000. A new trial has been set for the first week in January. Mr. Darrow announced to the court that it was probable that the defense would ask for separate trials for the eleven defendants. With renewed vigor, the N.A.A.C.P. is going into the case again determined to see it through to the end and to secure complete justice for the defendants.\nAfter the mistrial, Messrs. Darrow and Hays made a motion for the admission to bail of the defendants. Eight of them were freed on bail of $5,500 each while three others, Dr. Ossian H. Sweet, Henry Sweet and Leonard C. Morse, were freed on bail of $10,000 each. This bail has been almost entirely furnished by Negro property owners of Detroit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe First Battle of Detroit (1926)\nThe Challenge of Detroit (1925)\nFrank (1915)\nExtradition Cases (1920)\nThe Cause of Lynching (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nWalter F., White. 1926. “The Sweet Trial.”\nThe Crisis 31 (3): 125–29. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/31/03/sweet_trial.html."

There were in 1910, 151,341 Negro voters in these states. The number is probably near 200,000 today. It is safe to say that in an electorate of over 5,000,000 these 200,000 votes may easily hold a balance of power and certainly would be a valuable asset. Undoubtedly among Negro voters there is a good deal of indifference and lack of knowledge concerning woman suffrage. We tend to oppose the principle because we do not like the reactionary attitude of most white women toward our problems. We must remember, however, that we are facing a great question of right in which personal hatreds have no place. Every argument for Negro suffrage is an argument for woman’s suffrage; every argument for woman suffrage is an argument for Negro suffrage; both are great movements in democracy. There should be on the part of Negroes absolutely no hesitation whenever and wherever responsible human beings are without voice in their government. The man of Negro blood who hesitates to do them justice is false to his race, his ideals and his country.\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “Woman Suffrage.” The Crisis. 9(6):57.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVotes for Women (1918)\nVotes for Women (1914)\nVotes for Women (1912)\nOhio (1912)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “Woman Suffrage.” The Crisis\n9 (6): 57. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/09/06/womansuffrage.html."

    "text": "The General Federation of (white) Women’s Clubs sent a representative to the meeting of the National Association of Colored Women at Wilberforce, and the magazine of the General Federation published an excellent article concerning that meeting. On the strength of this the magazine has evidently obtained the mailing list of the colored organization and is sending this letter broadcast:\n\nGENERAL FEDERATION MAGAZINE  \nOnly official organ of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs\n \nNew York, N. Y, Sept. 22, 1914.\n \nMy dear Madam:\n \nYour name has been sent to me by Miss Zona Gale, formerly Chairman of Civics of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs, who recently spoke before your Colored Women’s Convention, as being one of the prominent colored women in this country who would without doubt be interested in the General Federation Magazine, which is the official organ of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs.\n \nI am using this month an account of your Convention by Miss Zona Gale and I know you will be interested to see that in this important Magazine. May I not hope for your support in the way of at least one subscription to the Magazine? I would like to add this also: If one woman could be appointed in each club or organization to take subscriptions, she might find it profiable for herself or her organization to make a business of this matter. The price of the Magazine is $1.00 a year and we allow a discount of 25% on each subscription. Can we not join our forces in some way? We should be glad to give you publicity in the Magazine whenever you desire.\n \nWe are sending you a sample copy of our Biennial number.\n \nVery cordially yours,  \nHarriet Bishop Waters,  \nGeneral Federation Magazine.\n\nThis letter has received the following reply from The Crisis\n\nDear Madam:\n \nI have your circular concerning a subscription to the General Federation Magazine.\n \nDo you think it is fair to ask a colored person to subscribe to the official organ of an organization which discriminates against them so outrageously as yours does?\n \nVery sincerely yours, etc.\n\nWe trust that similar letters will go from every colored woman approached. This is not a matter of hatred or complaint. It is a matter of self-respect. The General Federation of Women’s Clubs has insulted every black woman in America. They have deliberately and openly put a brand on her. Clubs composed of every race and nation in America are welcome to this federation except those of black women. Against this contemptible action taken by northern white women to placate the petty spite of southern white women colored women cannot and do not wish to take any action. They are quietly and effectively doing their own club work. But they refuse to forget the insult or condone it.\nAbove all they resent on the part of these narrow-minded white women the assumption that-the exclusion of colored women’s clubs from the General Federation has “helped” the colored organization. The stealing of my purse may make me careful and saving but I owe little gratitude to the thief, and at all events for the thief to demand gratitude is adding insult to injury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSuffering Suffragettes (1912)\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nWhite Co-Workers (1920)\nThe Next Step (1913)\nThe Black Man and the Unions (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “A Correspondence.”\nThe Crisis 9 (1): 30. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/09/01/correspondence.html."

    "text": "Mr. Peter Ten Eyke, representative from the 28th district, New York, writes: “It is my advice to you to drop agitating the things which you have outlined in your letter until such time as you find that the wild rumors are liable to become a reality.” This, of course, he says “in all sympathy with your race,” and it expresses exactly the attitude which the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is fighting and which its questionnaire addressed to congressional candidates seems to prove is the right fight for us to make.\nFirst, of course, and foremost, we have come across the men who do not care. George Nicholas, of Kentucky, says: “I do not desire your support. I am indifferent to your opposition.”\nOther congressmen are angry at the threat of non-support at the polls: Congressman Bathrick considers this “distinctly obnoxious and, I believe, liable to injure instead of help, the cause of the colored people.”\nOthers in considerable numbers seek to dodge the issue. Charles F. Wilcox, of New York, a Republican candidate, gives this remarkable excuse: “I have relatives now at the head of colored schools in the South. Under these circumstances I think you will understand my attitude sufficiently so that you will pardon my declining to answer specific questions at this time!” Griest, of Pennsylvania, draws himself up indignantly and is “surprised that a successor to the seat of Thaddeus Stevens should be subjected to this cross-examination.”\nOf course, we encounter the breezy optimist: “Nobody is thinking,” of abrogating the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment, says a Pennsylvania Democrat. There need be no antagonism between the races and “there is none,” says a Pennsylvania Progressive. Then right on top of these answers comes an Indiana Democrat who wants segregation and “Jim-Crow” cars in the District of Columbia, and a Texan who wants not only this but the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments repealed and the whole Negro race put out of the country. He adds gayly: “No Negroes vote in the Texas Democratic primaries, and very few Republicans vote in the general elections.” He also sends a clipping from a Dallas paper entitled “Jump Up Nigger En Crack Yo’ Heels.” A native of North Carolina, running in Montana, also refuses to pledge himself as to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, wants segregation and “will not oppose making invalid marriages of colored and white people.”\nAll this indicates clearly the present problem, and it is pleasant to note that some politicians have clear ideas at least as to the general justice of our position. Phelan, of Massachusetts, says frankly: “I do not favor segregation, not ‘Jim-Crow’ cars nor anything of the sort. I believe the colored people should have the rights which our Constitution and laws give them.” Osgood, a Massachusetts Progressive, is in favor “of equal social, legal and political rights for colored citizens.” Niles, a New York candidate, says: “I shall in the future, as I have always in the past, on every occasion public or private, social or political, assail ANY and EVERY measure, of whatever kind or nature, or description, that is inspired by hatred for, or opposition to, ANY race, nationality or creed.” And Murray Hulbert, of New York, says: “Talent knows no race or creed and I would accord to every man the full measure of reward which he merits.”\nRadicals like the Socialists and others speak strongly but not always with full comprehension of what they are saying. Thus, a Socialist of Minnesota declares “there is no race problem,” and a candidate of the Socialist Labor Party in Maryland, is fighting for a society “where economic equality will be for all irrespective of race, creed or color.” Weinstock, a Pennsylvania Progressive, says flatly: “The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments are not enforced if social liberty as well as political liberty is not given to all our citizens irrespective of color or creed.”\nA Pennsylvania Socialist stands squarely for the right but complains that colored voters always vote for the “common enemy.” John Burt, of Pennsylvania, voices the same thing and says feelingly: “Oh, how I wish your organization could guide aright the large population of colored people in this First Congressional District against the gang organization who has used them as so much merchandise for their own personal ends.”\nWhat is it that makes colored people, and intelligent colored people, so often vote for bosses? It is undoubtedly the canny stand of men like Boise Penrose. Mr. Penrose stands right up and tersely says that he will support war amendments, that he is opposed to segregation and “Jim-Crow” cars, that he will vote against anti-intermarriage laws, and that he never justifies lynching.\nIt is interesting to note, however, that there is disagreement among our political leaders even in such fundamental matters as lynching. A Montana man confesses that he has sometimes justified lynching. An Ohio Republican is in favor of it in “some cases.” A Pennsylvania Progressive who lives on a “college campus” wants it “very, very seldom;” and Edward Hart, a professor in Lafayette College, justifies it under certain “exceptional” circumstances! With such leaders can we blame the mob?\nPerhaps the most striking thing about all these answers is the number of people who frankly say that they are not informed on the Negro problem; that they simply “do not know the facts.” This is the severest condemnation of the past attitude of the colored people and their friends that could possibly be made. It is the business of people who want wrongs righted to let the world know just what the wrongs are. A Michigan man is “not at all familiar with these questions.” Congressman Good has “not studied” segregation. A Pennsylvania man says his “information is too limited.” An Illinois Progressive is “not sure about his attitude.” A Michigan Democrat is “not informed.” An Ohio Republican has not “fully considered the matter.” A Minnesota Progressive wants “to know more,” and so on through dozens of answers.\nNaturally, the greatest wavering is on the question of intermarriage and the wavering shows how remiss the colored people have been in not making their attitude perfectly clear. It is a delicate and unpleasant subject which no one wants to argue and yet the results of not arguing it are so frightful that honest men are forced to state their opinion. The real problem is illustrated by a piece of news that comes to us this month from California:\nA white policeman, F. A. Winter of Los Angeles, has been clandestinely meeting Juanita Nelson, an orphan colored girl. She has a child. The policeman, run to earth, acknowledges his fault and offers to marry the girl but THE LAWS OF CALIFORNIA PREVENT THIS!\nHere, then, is the problem: Did the colored people want this girl to have a white husband? They most certainly did not. Did the white people want the policeman to have a colored wife? Evidently not. But the fact remains that these people wanted each other and what is a civilized world going to do about it? Of course, the first answer that rushes to the mouth of Gibbons, an Illinois Progressive, is “I am opposed to intermarriage on ethnological grounds as it deteriorates both races and is a stock process of extermination.”\nThis is absolutely false, as anyone may learn by reading Dr. Loeb’s article in this number of The Crisis. We have a perfect right to oppose racial intermarriage, but we have no right, consciously or unconsciously, to lie about the reasons.\nDespite our predilections, the answer of Paxton Hibben, of Indiana, is absolutely the only decent answer: “I shall vote to make no woman’s children illegitimate.” It is not enough here to rely on general philanthropy. Linden Bates, of New York, states that “it is a basic Progressive policy” to protect women and children of “all races.” But Gulley, just as good a Progressive, from Indiana, says: “I will not oppose a law making such marriages invalid.”\nHere, again, a large number of answers waver. Some think it is sufficient to say that they are “opposed to anti-racial marriage” but are not clear as to how it is to be stopped. Others want to stop it by law but would not have the law retroactive. What they would do in the California case they do not say.\nLee, of Colorado, expresses the attitude of a man who needs enlightenment: “I oppose racial intermarriage. It would seem to me, without having an opportunity to examine the matter pro and con, that a law making such marriage invalid is not a proper means of preventing the same and my present belief is that I would oppose it.” There are some men, however, who are square and clear. Hobart, of Ohio, says: “There should be no different rule when white and colored marry than when white and white or black and black marry.” A native-born southerner from Tennessee adds: “I am opposed to annulling any marriages anywhere by law.” And C.R. Lawrence, a Massachusetts Progressive, has this clear word: “One cannot look upon many of the faces of our citizens and be blind to the blending to a more or less degree between the colored and white people and I would rather see this inevitable tendency accomplished rightfully than criminally. I fear no more affinity as to marriage between the white and colored people with the marriage bars down than up.”\nFinally, a few, but a very few people, perceive that the fight that this Association is making is not simply “for colored people.” It is for the whole nation. As Representative Focht, of Pennsylvania, says: “Fifty or more members of Congress from southern states are there illegally;” and an Indiana Progressive adds, “The creation of rotten boroughs in this country is a negation of Republican government.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPresidential Candidates (1920)\nMuddle (1916)\nPresidential Candidates (1916)\nAn Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson (1913)\nThe Next Step (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “The Congressmen and the NAACP.”\nThe Crisis 9 (2): 85–87. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/09/02/congressmen_and_the_naacp.html."

At the same time it must be remembered that directly in questions of this sort lurk the most baffling difficulties of our race problem.\nThe Y.M.C.A. movement in America is not acting in a Christian manner toward colored folk. In most cities colored people are, as in New York, excluded from all the well-equipped branches of the Y.M.C.A. and herded in a poorly equipped “colored” branch. In other cities like Boston and Providence recent attempts have been frustrated to do the same thing. In still other cities the Negroes are segregated but as we showed last month splendid new accommodations have been erected for them. What now should be the attitude of colored people and their friends toward this movement? Manifestly, here is a case for niceness of judgment but unerring adherence to principle. It is a fine thing that the colored people have such well-equipped Y.M.C.A. buildings in Chicago and Washington and Philadelphia, but it is an unchristian and unjust and dangerous procedure which segregates colored people in the Y.M.C.A. movement. However much we may be glad of the colored Y.M.C.A. movement on the one hand, on the other hand we must never for a single moment fail to recognize the injustice which has made it an unfortunate necessity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe White Church (1917)\nThe Present (1917)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nThe Next Step (1913)\nSegregation in the North (1934)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “Y.M.C.A.” The Crisis 9 (2):\n77, 80. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/09/02/ymca.html."

To name a few of these organizations; there is the Alliance Israelite Universelle, over fifty years old with eight branches; there is the American Jewish Committee, a great federation of individuals and organizations “to prevent the infraction of the civil and religious rights of Jews in any part of the world.” Its fourteen districts cover the United States and beside the large sums which it handles annually it has an Emergency Trust Fund of nearly $200,000; the American Jewish Historical Society is twenty-two years old and has 373 members; twenty-four periodicals belong to the American Jewish Press Association; the Workmen’s Circle has 509 branches with 45,000 members; the Baron De Hirsch Fund has millions tor agricultural and industrial education; the Council of Jewish Women is seven years old with 78 sections covering the whole country; the Federation of American Zionists is seventeen years old with 14,000 members; the Roumanian Jews are organized with 40,000 members, and the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society has 29,000 members. There are endless secret and semi-secret orders: the B’nai B’rith with 34,000 members; the two branches of Brith Abraham with over 250,000 members; the Brith Sholom with 46,000 members; the Free Sons of Judah with 23,000 members, and so on. There are agricultural and colonial associations, agricultural aid societies, a Jewish chatauqua, a consumptives’ relief society, beside colleges, theological seminaries and last but not least a great national conference of Jewish charities with its 115 constituent societies.\nThe Jewish Publication Society sends out the American Jewish Year Book annually and a number of other carefully selected publications. It is supported by 12,000 members and has total assets of over $100,000. There have been 26 Jews in Congress and there are five in the present Congress.\nThis is the great net work of organization which makes the Jewish people the tremendous force for good and for uplift which they are in this country.

As to “Billy” Sunday there is room for opinions. Personally we do not object to him; he is quite natural under the circumstances and a fit expression of his day. He is nearly the same thing as the whirling dervish, the snake dancer and devotee of “Mumbo Jumbo.” Such methods of appealing to primitive passions and emotions have been usual in the history of the world. Today they are joined, in the case of Mr. Sunday, to picturesque abuse of the English language, unusual contortions and a curious moral obtuseness which allows Mr. Sunday to appropriate a whole speech belonging to Robert Ingersol and use it as his own. The result has been a large number of converts and widespread demand for Mr. Sunday’s services. All this seems necessary. Evidently Mr. Sunday’s methods are the only ones that appeal to white Christians. Reason does not appeal. Suffering and poverty does not appeal. The lynching and burning of human beings and torturing of women has no affect.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The following editorial on “The Alleged Failure of Democracy” was written by the editor of The Crisis and printed in the Boston Sunday Globe:\nWe are becoming more democratic, but not easily, not without struggle and misgivings. Our progress seems even slower than it is because we have really experienced so little real democracy in the past. We founded a republic in 1787 which was in reality an aristocracy of the most pronounced tendencies. The democracy ushered in by Andrew Jackson was the beginning of that system of government by deception where “the people” are congratulated on the possession of all powers of government, while the real rulers hide in the background so effectually that their very existence often is not sensed. Since the Civil War we have driven these rulers into the open, and frankly acknowledged, weighed and studied their power.\nFrom this knowledge we have started well on the way toward dethroning the ward heeler and the petty boss, and are hammering at the strongholds of the greater bosses. Our real difficulty comes in settling in our own minds a proper, permanent repository for the power thus regained. In other words, we are facing to-day still the elementary problem of democracy: How far do we dare trust the mass of the people, not with sham power and sounding phrases, but with real power?\nThose on the one hand who call for commission government, and those on the other hand who ask for the initiative and the recall represent the two different answers to this problem. True it is, that there are those far-sighted ones who combine both demands. For the most part, however, we may distinguish those who would deposit the power won from the bosses with one or more strong men for safekeeping; and those who would try and place that power just as far as possible in the hands of the masses.\nThere can be no doubt that the former type of thinkers gains great strength and support from the supposed failure of certain democratic experiments in the past, particularly in the case of the foreign vote in our cities and of the Negro vote during reconstruction times. The alleged failure of democracy in reconstruction times especially has been used in the past and is still used as a tremendous argument against democracy in the nation and in the world. The argument runs something like this: “Ignorant freedmen failed as voters. This proves that democratic government cannot rest on ignorance.” But how much learning is necessary to a share in the government? Immediately our ideas enlarge: “Government is for the educated and the expert. It is a reward, not a right. Democracy is an evolution that may come to fruition in a thousand years. To-day we need the strength and efficiency found only in a few.” In the face of such argument it is high time that the people of this country asked themselves seriously two questions: What is democracy? Did democracy fail in reconstruction?\nDemocracy is not a gift of power, but a reservoir of knowledge. Only the soul that suffers knows its suffering. Only the one who needs knows what need means. Ignorance may vitiate the expression of needs and vice may deceive, but it remains true that despotism and aristocracy have displayed far more ignorance of the real needs of the people than the most ignorant of democracies. The people alone are the sources of that real knowledge which enables a State to be ruled for the best good of its inhabitants. And only by putting power in the hands of each inhabitant can we hope to approximate in the ultimate use of that power the greatest good to the greatest number.\nSeldom in the history of the world has this great truth been so well proved as in the experience of the American Negro. Without civil or political rights, and admitting every claim of benevolence on the part of his master, he became a slave, whose very existence threatened the industrial and spiritual life of the nation. Emancipated and given a vote, despite his ignorance and inexperience, he gave the South three gifts, so valuable that no one to-day would dream of giving them up:\n\nThe public-school system.\nThe enfranchisement of the poor whites.\nThe beginning of modern social legislation in land reform, eleemosynary institutions and social uplift.\n\nThe Negro was not disfranchised because he had failed in democratic government, but because there was every reason to believe that he would succeed, and it was his success which the beaten masters feared more than his failure.\nHaving disfranchised him with this fiction of failure, that same fiction is being used to-day to discredit democracy throughout the nation, to stop the just enfranchisement of women, to curtail the power of the foreign born and their descendants, and to support the argument in the twentieth century that the democratic ideals of the nineteenth century were in vain.\nTo the help of this program comes the wholesale exploitation and despising of colored races and the suicidal career of universal conquest to which Europe stands committed.\nBut the march of real democracy goes on. Slowly but surely the masses of men will become the great depositors of the bulk of both political and economical power, for their own good. Only democratic government can be both enlightened and selfish, both bond and free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Possibility of Democracy in America (1928)\nThe Possibility of Democracy (1928)\nBlaine of Maine (1932)\nThe Ballot (1919)\nViolence (1934)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “The Alleged Failure of Democracy.”\nThe Crisis 9 (3): 131–32. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/09/03/alleged_failure.html."

    "text": "The political situation of the American Negro this fall has many anomalies, contradictions and encouragements. A white Southerner has been made Chairman of the Republican National Committee. He will undoubtedly do what he can to eliminate the Negroes from political activity in the South. If he is successful, there will grow up in the South two parties dominated by white men. This alarms some Negroes and certain of their friends. The Crisis is not alarmed. If these are two real parties and not merely one party with two faces, then they will need votes; and the more progressive their program is, the greater will be their need. This will be the Negroes’ opportunity.\nBut this means that the Negro must become opportunist in politics. No area illustrates this better than Harlem. Black Harlem cares nothing for political labels. Candidates may be marked Democrat, Republican, Socialist, Harlem votes for the candidate. Moreover, it votes very largely for local reasons. It will support Mayor Walker, not because he is the best candidate. He is not. Norman Thomas, the Socialist candidate, is by long odds the best man running. But he has no chance of election. On the other hand, Mayor Walker has done a great deal for Harlem and is a much better man than the Republican, La Guardia; and Harlem will stand by him. Harlem will vote for a colored Congressman, for two colored Aldermen, for a colored member of the Assembly, for a colored leaders in Republican organizations.\nIt is, of course, unfortunate that in all this, Harlem and the Negroes of the United States, must vote “colored”; but the fault is not theirs. So long as the color of a man’s skin means more, to most candidates, than the tariff, democratic government, prohibition, war, or any other issue, just so long the black man must vote with his eye on this fact. In these larger issues, he disfranchises himself, but he refuses to commit suicide in order to save a white world.\n\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1929. “The Negro in Politics.” The Crisis. 36(11):387.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro Party (1916)\nPolitical Straws (1923)\nThe Negro Politician (1928)\nMuddle (1916)\nThe Presidential Campaign (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1929. “The Negro in Politics.”\nThe Crisis 36 (11): 387. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/36/11/negro_in_politics.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The pressing political problem in the United States is that of establishing the principle of a Third Party movement. It does not matter how logical and convincing an appeal is launched by any group, unless they can effectively place this before the voters of the nation, their work is in vain. For many years we have seen in the United States the rise of Third Party movements which have come to naught. They have failed, not because they did not have a good program and a right to persist and grow, but because they could not get the proper political hearing.\nThe difficulty of making the appeal of the Third Party effective, arises in part from our indirect method of electing presidents, but the greater reason is the so-called Solid South. This is a difficulty which for years no gentleman was permitted to discuss. Anyone who dared to attack or arraign the astonishing political machine which dominates twelve states of the United States and is in almost absolute control of 124 out of 531 electoral votes, is supposed to be reactionary, opposed to national unity and a fanatic on the race problem. Hiding back of these excuses, there has been built up in the South a political machine before which Tammany pales into insignificance. It is a machine which dictates the presidency, declares war, fosters imperialism, maintains a protective tariff, bolsters plutocracy, and above all, makes the chances of any Third Party movement impossible.\nYet, strange to say, every recent Third Party movement that we have had, has begun its career by appealing to this machine for liberal support! Even the Socialists, before the War, cast longing eyes in this direction. The Populists staked their all upon it. The Progressives, led by Theodore Roosevelt, made their chief appeal to this Southern machine, and _ the Farmer-Labor Party, while it did not actually appeal to the South, refused in any way, even by implication, to. attack Southern political methods.\nThe Socialists in the last campaign attacked the Solid South. Their attack was not given prominence or developed as its importance demanded, but, nevertheless, the platform did demand the “reduction of the representation in Congress of those states where large sections of the citizens are disfranchised by force or fraud.” And the “Open Letter to American Liberals and Progressives” was even more explicit.\n\nThe very backbone of the Democratic Party, the old, reactionary bourbons of the South are still engaged in the shameful policy of making it all but impossible for great numbers of the Negro population to vote; a Southern bourbon class which, with the industrialization of the South, is now pressing its claims for high tariffs and for the private exploitation of the water powers not already bequeathed by the nation to private monopoly.\n\nEven here the main result was not sufficiently stressed, and that result is that of the 531 electoral votes, a Third Party today can only appeal to 407. Even if the party gained a majority of the popular votes back of these 407 electoral votes, nevertheless, with the help of the Solid South, the Democratic Party could be triumphantly elected. What happens then, continually, (it happened in 1912, in 1924 and in 1928), is that the practical voter has to choose between the Democratic ticket, backed by the Solid South, and a Republican ticket; and if after several years of Republican government, being convinced that nothing could be worse, he tries Democracy it is with disastrous results. The political power of the South, built on the forced disfranchisement of two million Negroes and the voluntary disfranchisement of more than two million whites, concentrates in the hands of a ruthless gang, more political power than any machine in the United States ever wielded before. It must be attacked and attacked frankly and openly, and the smoke screen of the “Negro problem” must not divert the attack.\nThe results of the election of 1928 illustrate the situation:\nEleven Southern states cast, in 1924, 2,865,747 votes. In 1928, they cast 3,632,292. Thus, of more than four million disfranchised voters, one million came to the polls, and the Democrats consequently lost 5 states with 60 electoral votes.\nBut was this a real triumph of democracy, and a “breaking” of the Solid South? Nothing of the sort. While they voted against the machine, these voters did so for no modern reasons. They voted because of religious prejudice, hatred of the party domination of New York, fear of the Negro, and prohibition. Of the modern problems presented, for instance, by Socialists, they knew nothing and cared nothing. They had no intelligence of nor intelligent answers to the problems of protecting labor, curbing monopoly and privilege, preserving natural resources, equitable taxation of incomes, and preventing crime. The million new electors who came into the field were densely ignorant and prejudiced. For the most part they continued to assert their party “regularity,” i.e. their voluntary disfranchisement so far as national questions go, and they reasserted their determination to enforce the 18th amendment, to nullify the 14th and 15th, and to ignore the 19th.\nIn future elections, as in the past, these 124 electoral votes can be appealed to by no Third Party and can be depended on to keep reaction and Plutocracy in power. To make assurance doubly sure, Work is backing the “Lily White” faction of the Southern Republicans whose program is not simply to disfranchise Negroes at the polls, but also in the party councils.\nHere, then, is the first point of attack for any Third Party that is worth its salt or hopes ever to win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Third Party (1928)\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Parties (1924)\nThe Election (1914)\nHow Shall We Vote (1920)\nYoung Voters (1932)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1929. “Third Party.” The Crisis 36\n(2): 58. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/36/02/third_party.html."

Johnson of Howard University; Robert R. Moton, Tuskegee Institute; Mary Van Kleeck, of the Russell Sage Foundation; Dr. George E. Haynes of the Federation of Churches was Executive Secretary. The day sessions were held in the auditorium of the Department of the Interior, and the evening sessions in the auditorium of the Medical School of Howard University.\nBefore these meetings the Research Committee, under Charles S. Johnson, of Fisk University laid a digest of 250 typewritten pages. The purpose of it was “to construct a reasonably faithful contemporary picture of Negro life and the status of race relations as revealed in recent social studies and in official statistics.” This tremendous piece of compilation was done with unusual completeness and fairness. With this data before them it was the task of the delegates to seek an answer to three questions:\n\nIn the light of social research what do we now know about Negro life and race relations as affecting both the white and colored races in the United States?\nWhat significance has this knowledge for the programs of social organizations whose purpose it is to improve these conditions?\nWhat gaps in knowledge are revealed, calling for further study by universities and research organizations?\n\nThe subjects taken up were as follows:\nMonday morning, December 17th, “Health,” with Louis I. Dublin, Chief Statistician of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and Dr. A. B. Jackson, of Howard University, as speakers. Monday afternoon, “Education,” with W. A. Robinson, former Supervisor of Negro High Schools of North Carolina, and Professor Mabel Carney of Columbia University, and Principal James E. Gregg of Hampton, as speakers. On Tuesday morning, “Industry and Agriculture” were discussed by Monroe N. Work of Tuskegee Institute and Niles Carpenter, of the University of Buffalo; on Tuesday afternoon, “Recreation and Housing’, by Forrester B. Washington of Atlanta, Ernest T. Attwell of New York, T. J. Woofter of the University of North Carolina, and Roscoe C. Bruce of New York; Wednesday morning,”Law Observance and Administration” by Thorsten Sellin of the University of Pennsylvania, and Lawrence Oxley of North Carolina; Wednesday afternoon, “Citizenship and Race Relations’, by W. E. B. DuBois of New York and Herbert A. Miller of Ohio State University.\nThese sessions were attended only by delegates. Public sessions were held Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evening, at which general summaries of the discussions were given. On Monday evening, the speakers were F.O. Nichols, Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins University, and the Presidents of Fisk and Morehouse. Tuesday evening, the speakers were Charles Wesley of Howard, Mary E. McDowell of Chicago, R.S. Wallace, and John P. Frey of the American Federation of Labor. The speakers for the final evening were James Weldon Johnson, Clark Foreman, Alain Locke, Julius Rosenwald, John M. Glenn, Edwin R. Embree, Mordecai W. Johnson, R.R. Moton, Mary Van Kleeck and Anson Phelps Stokes.\nIt goes without saying that with so ambitious and full a program the Conference left much to be desired. The discussions fell far below possibilities, partly because of lack of time and partly because of a certain timidity and fear of free expression. “There was a good deal of unnecessary repetition: the speakers repeated what the Research Committee had reported, and other speakers summed up what the main speakers had said. The net result often was almost like spoon feeding of children lest they mentally overeat.\nNevertheless, never before in the history of the United States have so many organizations, representing so diverse points of view and methods of approach, come together in a spirit of tolerance and inquiry to seek out the facts which underlie the relations of races in the United States.\nOf course, conclusions could not be reached; nor were they indeed desired. The object of the meetings was enlightenment, and none could possibly have left without a feeling that he had learned something. In the matter of health, there is no doubt, but what great strides in our knowledge of the condition of the Negro has taken place in the last twenty years. No scientist today doubts but what the American Negro is going to survive and is going to achieve a sound body and has a normal brain. The great need now is physicians and hospitals.\nThe advance in Education has set to rest all questions of the ability of Negroes to absorb and use modern education. There is still a pressing demand for the eradication of Negro illiteracy; the betterment of Common and High Schools; and the endowment of good colleges.\nIndustry and Agriculture show the revolution due to the migration of Negroes from South to North, and their entrance into industry as common and semi-skilled laborers. The consequent problems of Housing and Recreation are severe and pressing.\nCrime was shown not to be racial but the result of changing conditions of living; of poverty and of ignorance; and it is by no means certain that the rate of crime among Negroes is even as large as those among whites.\nIn Citizenship and Race Relations an insistent demand for the suffrage was made. One speaker said in his climax: “I hold this truth to be evident, that a disfranchised working-class in modern industrial civilization is worse than helpless. It is a menace, not simply to itself, but to every other group in the community. It will be diseased; it will be criminal; it will be ignorant; it will be the plaything of mobs, and it will be insulted by caste restrictions.”\nThe whole bogie of inherent, ineradicable race distinctions was attacked. “Races that try to be exclusive are both the producers and the consumers of each other’s goods. The competition of laborers seems immediate and threatening. However, with a rising tide of economic activity, no race is self-sufficient, and the organization of interracial labor will be just as easily demonstrated and just as necessary as is international banking.”\nOne comes from a meeting of this sort with a distinct feeling that all of the labor and devotion which was put into this ought not to be lost. There is no need for any super-organization. Agreement is not yet wide enough for a movement of this kind; but The Crisis suggests that the following program be carried out, to obviate, on one hand, such an impossible crowding of problems and spoiling of real conference and discussion as was inevitable at this meeting; and on the other hand, to widen and deepen our knowledge of facts.\nThe Crisis proposes that the sponsoring organizations, and any other organizations that may wish to come in, should arrange a comprehensive program; admission should depend upon willingness to inaugurate, with the cooperation and consent of consulting Committee of experts, a long intensive scientific study of some one phase of the Negro problems; and that there be held each year a meeting at which the result of one of these lines of study be reported to the public and adequately and thoroughly discussed. The following year another subject should be taken up, etc. At the beginning, of course, subjects would have to be chosen which had less than ten years’ investigation, but it would be easy to do this because, for instance, in matters of health, education, industry and agriculture, recreation and housing, there is already a fairly good beginning of material. In 1929 and 1939, for instance, we might have a meeting devoted entirely to health, in which all of the studies made and available, should be presented and discussed. After that the following problems could be put on: 1930 and 1940, Education; 1931 and 1941, Industry and Agriculture; 1932 and 1942, Housing and Recreation; 1933 and 1943, Law Observance and Administration; 1934 and 1944, Citizenship and the Suffrage; 1935 and 1945, Race and Race Relations. With the year 1936, the question of health could again be taken up with seven years of additional study over 1929, and so on through the program.\nAt each of the meetings, while the main topic which had received the intensive study for the period, would receive the main part of the attention, one or two sessions might be given to a general survey of all conditions, in which new studies and new occurrences would be partially reported. The annual meetings could be in charge of the organization making the main study, with financial aid for the meeting from all member organizations.\nThis was the plan that was conceived at Atlanta University. It could not be carried out there because we had only an annual appropriation of $5,000, which included our salaries and expenses. The scheme, therefore, had to be given up; but this would seem to be an unusually favorable time for redrafting and improving the scheme and starting a study of group development and relations which would be unique in the history of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWhite Co-Workers (1920)\nInterracial Love in Texas (1930)\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Race Segregation (1934)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nSuffering Suffragettes (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1929. “The National Interracial\nConference.” The Crisis 36 (2): 47, 69–70. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/36/02/national_interracial_conference.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Herbert Hoover has started something. We very much doubt if he understands the ramifications of his late declaration. His statement is that Republican Presidents for many years have tried to build up state Republican organizations in the Southern states; that this Southern Republican Party must “commend itself to the citizens of those states”; that the basis of sound government is a strong two-party representation; that there must be no sectionalism in politics; and that the re-organization must come “from the states themselves.”\nHe then lists the states: North Carolina and Virginia have a Republican Party. Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Florida are strengthening the Republican Party, and Mr. Hoover commends the movement. He puts Mississippi, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida on the black list, and says nothing about Tennessee.\nAll this is singularly contradictory. By law, social and economic pressure, the formation of a real Republican Party has been resisted by the Solid South for a generation. The only movement which they have been willing to admit has been the forming of a white Republican Party, and it is this “Lily White” movement which is triumphing in everyone of the states which Mr. Hoover praises. Negroes have kept their hold in Mississippi, Georgia and Tennessee. And two of these states, Mr. Hoover, roundly condemns.\nVery good. Does President Hoover include black citizens among those whose judgment must “commend” the re-organization? If the Perry Howard and Ben Davis type of political morality does not suit him, does he not know a single decent Negro citizen in Georgia and Mississippi who can be trusted? And when re-organization must come from the states themselves, does this dominating local opinion include poor black laborers or only rich white bankers?\nAs a practical measure, suppose a Republican Party under white leadership and control grows up in the Southern states? On whom must it depend for votes? Manifestedly, on Negroes. Why should Negroes vote for “Lily Whites” in preference to voting for Bourbon Democrats? They must be offered something: offices, better schools, better living conditions, abolition of “Jim Crow” cars. Something! If the Democrats and “Lily Whites” compete for the Negro vote, then only patience and brains are needed to bring Negro office holders and Negro suffrage. If neither party offers anything, the new Republican Party can never exist, because it will be without votes. Even if its Federal patronage attracts any considerable body of votes from the white Democratic Party, the white Democrats can retaliate by inviting in the Negro voters, which is precisely what has happened in Tennessee. In this case, the Republicans, in self-defense, have got to submit at least to a partial Negro leadership, and Robert R. Church of Tennessee maintains his position with the benediction of the President.\nVery well, an excellent program, says the country. But what does the Solid South say? The corrupt and ruthless hierarchy of Vardaman, Blease and Harrison who have made democracy in the United States impossible because of its rotten boroughs? These leaders are the ones and not the Negroes who are angry beyond expression at this blow at white supremacy which Herbert Hoover has aimed at black men’s heads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRemember (1920)\nThe Republicans (1915)\nHoward (1928)\nThe White Primary (1911)\nEvery Four Years (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1929. “Herbert Hoover and the South.”\nThe Crisis 36 (5): 167. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/36/05/hoover_and_the_south.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There was held in the Coliseum in Chicago in March a debate between Lothrop Stoddard and the Editor of The Crisis on the question “Should the Negro be Encouraged to Seek Cultural Equality?” The debate was notable; first, because of the popular interest which it aroused. Every one of the four thousand seats was taken and several hundred persons were unable to gain entrance. Probably one-third or more of the audience was white. Secondly, one noted the apparent disinclination of Mr. Stoddard frankly to state his position. This is symptomatic of a widespread change in the attitude of white Americans. It is becoming more and more difficult for them to state frankly the case against the Negro. The reason for this is that the main facts upon which they have been relying are no longer plausible and the thesis without them is barbarous, unscientific and unchristian.\nThe Editor asked Mr. Stoddard in the debate: “Why should not all people be encouraged to seek and reach the highest human culture?” And he intimated that the only plausible reason for denying them this privilege was the assumption that their inferiority was so great that they could never hope to reach the goal and would simply be made unhappy by striving. The obvious answer to this would be to say Yes and then to prove this inferiority of the Negro. This, Mr. Stoddard did not do and did not attempt to do. The reason probably was that he realized that such attempted proof would not only lose him the sympathy of his black audience, but gain no particular enthusiasm from a thousand whites who themselves belonged mostly to laboring classes just as “inferior” to Mr. Stoddard’s Nordic superman as the average American Negro.\nMr. Stoddard, therefore, took refuge in two contentions: That differences between races should be maintained by a “bi-racial” arrangement, and that the social equality which would follow cultural equality could not be countenanced. The Editor’s rejoinder was that “Bi-racialism” could not and would not work in a modern world where the whites themselves had been foremost in breaking down race barriers; and that social equality was civilized, inevitable and desirable among social equals, and not compulsory among others.\nIt was an interesting occasion; but the white man’s presentation of his side of the controversy was much weaker than it need have been. On the other hand, if it had been stronger, it would have been a public confession of a determination to stop human progress. This is what the present dominant majority of white folk propose to do. But naturally they do not care to say so, openly, publicly and plainly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSocial Equality (1928)\nThe Truth (1912)\nA Statement (1919)\nThe Negro Politician (1928)\nToward a New Racial Philosophy (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1929. “The Chicago Debate.”\nThe Crisis 36 (5): 167. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/36/05/chicago_debate.html."

It is easily the greatest event in the world since the French Revolution and possibly since the fall of Rome. The experiment is increasingly successful. Russia occupies the center of the world’s attention today and as a state it is recognized by every civilized nation, except the United States, Spain, Portugal and some countries of South America.\nThe challenge to the capitalistic form of industry and to the governments which this form dominates, is more and more tremendous because of the present depression. If Socialism as a form of government and industry is on trial in Russia, capitalism as a form of industry and government is just as surely on trial throughout the world and is more and more clearly recognizing the fact."

Moreover, for many years, democratic political control of our government by the masses of the people made it possible to envisage without violence any kind of reform in government or industry which appealed to the people. Recently, however, the people of the United States have begun to recognize that their political power is curtailed by organized capital in industry and that in this industry, democracy does not prevail; and that until wider democracy does prevail in industry, democracy in government is seriously curtailed and often quite ineffective. Also, because of recurring depressions the high wage is in part illusory."

The Progressives and Socialists propose in general increased government ownership of land and natural resources, state control of the larger public services and such progressive taxation of incomes and inheritance as shall decrease the number and power of the rich. The Communists, on the other hand, propose an entire sweeping away of the present organization of industry; the ownership of land, resources, machines and tools by the state, the conducting of business by the state under incomes which the state limits. And in order to introduce this complete Socialistic regime, Communists propose a revolutionary dictatorship by the working class, as the only sure, quick and effective path."

In the letters from United States Senators published in this issue of The Crisis, we find, with all the sympathy and good-will expressed, a prevailing helplessness when it comes to advice on specific action. Reactionaries like Fess, Conservatives like Bulkley and Capper, Progressives like Borah and Norris, all can only say: “You have done as well as could be expected; you suffer many present disadvantages; there is nothing that we can do to help you, and your salvation lies in patience and further effort on your own part.” The Socialist, as represented by Norman Thomas in the February Crisis, invites the Negro as a worker to vote for the Socialist Party as the party of workers. He offers the Negro no panacea for prejudice and caste but assumes that the uplift of the white worker will automatically emancipate the yellow, brown and black."

    "section": "The Scottsboro Cases",
    "text": "The Scottsboro Cases\nFinally, the Scottsboro cases come and put new emphasis on the appeal of the Communists. Advocating the defense of the eight Alabama black boys, who without a shadow of doubt have been wrongly accused of crime, the Communists not only asked to take charge of the defense of these victims, but they proceeded to build on this case an appeal to the American Negro to join the Communist movement as the only solution of their problem.\nImmediately, these two objects bring two important problems; first, can the Negroes with their present philosophy and leadership defend the Scottsboro cases successfully? Secondly, even if they can, will such defense help them to solve their problem of poverty and caste?\nIf the Communistic leadership in the United States had been broadminded and far-sighted, it would have acknowledged frankly that the honesty, earnestness and intelligence of the N.A.A.C.P. during twenty years of desperate struggle proved this organization under present circumstances to be the only one, and its methods the only methods available, to defend these boys and it would have joined capitalists and laborers north and south, black and white in every endeavor to win freedom for victims threatened with judicial murder. Then beyond that and with Scottsboro as a crimson and terrible text, Communists could have proceeded to point out that legal defense alone, even if successful, will never solve the larger Negro problem but that further and more radical steps are needed. ## Communist Strategy\nUnfortunately, American Communists are neither wise nor intelligent. They sought to accomplish too much at one stroke. They tried to prove at once that the N.A.A.C.P. did not wish to defend the victims at Scottsboro and that the reason for this was that Negro leadership in the N.A.A.C.P. was allied with the capitalists. The first of these two efforts was silly and the Communists tried to accomplish it by deliberate lying and deception. They accused the N.A.A.C.P. of stealing, misuse of funds, lack of interest in the Scottsboro cases, cowardly surrender to malign forces, inefficiency and a policy of do-nothing.\nNow whatever the N.A.A.C.P. has lacked, it is neither dishonest nor cowardly, and already events are proving clearly that the only effective defense of the Scottsboro boys must follow that which has been carefully organized, engineered and paid for by the N.A.A.C.P., and that the success of this defense is helped so far as the Communists cooperate by hiring bourgeois lawyers and appealing to bourgeois judges; but is hindered and made doubtful by ill-considered and foolish tactics against the powers in whose hands the fate of the Scottsboro victims lies.\nIf the Communists want these lads murdered, then their tactics of threatening judges and yelling for mass action on the part of white southern workers is calculated to insure this.\nAnd, on the other hand, lying and deliberate misrepresentation of friends who are fighting for the same ideals as the Communists, are old capitalistic, bourgeois weapons of which the Communists ought to be ashamed. The final exploit at Camp Hill is worthy of the Russian Black Hundreds, whoever promoted it: black sharecroppers, half-starved and desperate were organized into a “Society for the Advancement of Colored People” and then induced to meet and protest against Scottsboro. Sheriff and white mob killed one and imprisoned 34. If this was instigated by Communists, it is too despicable for words; not because the plight of the black peons does not shriek for remedy but because this is no time to bedevil a delicate situation by drawing a red herring across the trail of eight innocent children.\nNevertheless, the N.A.A.C.P. will defend these 34 victims of Southern fear and communist irresponsibility.\nThe ultimate object of the Communists, was naturally not merely nor chiefly to save the boys accused at Scottsboro; it was to make this case a center of agitation to expose the helpless condition of Negroes, and to prove that anything less than the radical Communist program could not emancipate them."

    "section": "The Negro Bourgeoisie",
    "text": "The Negro Bourgeoisie\nThe question of the honesty and efficiency of the N.A.A.C.P. in the defense of the Scottsboro boys, just as in a dozen other cases over the length and breadth of the United States, is entirely separate from the question as to whether or not Negro leadership is tending toward socialism and communism or toward capitalism. The charge of the Communists that the present set-up of Negro America is that of the petit bourgeois minority dominating a helpless black proletariat, and surrendering to white profiteers is simply a fantastic falsehood. The attempt to dominate Negro Americans by purely capitalistic ideas died with Booker T. Washington. The battle against it was begun by the Niagara Movement and out of the Niagara Movement arose the N.A.A.C.P. Since that time there has never been a moment when the dominating leadership of the American Negro has been mainly or even largely dominated by wealth or capital or by capitalistic ideals.\nThere are naturally some Negro capitalists: some large landowners, some landlords, some industrial leaders and some investors; but the great mass of Negro capital is not owned or controlled by this group. Negro capital consists mainly of small individual savings invested in homes, and in insurance, in lands for direct cultivation and individually used tools and machines. Even the automobiles owned by Negroes represent to a considerable extent personal investments, designed to counteract the insult of the “Jim Crow” car. The Insurance business, which represents a large amount of Negro capital is for mutual co-operation rather than exploitation. Its profit is limited and its methods directed by the State. Much of the retail business is done in small stores with small stocks of goods, where the owner works side by side with one or two helpers, and makes a personal profit less than a normal American wage. Negro professional men—lawyers, physicians, nurses and teachers—represent capital invested in their education and in their office equipment, and not in commercial exploitation. There are few colored manufacturers of material who speculate on the products of hired labor. Nine-tenths of the hired Negro labor is under the control of white capitalists. There is probably no group of 12 million persons in the modern world which exhibits smaller contrasts in personal income than the American Negro group. Their emancipation will not come, as among the Jews, from an internal readjustment and ousting of exploiters; rather it will come from a wholesale emancipation from the grip of the white exploiters without.\nIt is, of course, always possible, with the ideals of America, that a full fledged capitalistic system may develop in the Negro group; but the dominant leadership of the Negro today, and particularly the leadership represented by the N.A.A.C.P. represents NO such tendency. For two generations the social leaders of the American Negro with very few exceptions have been poor men, depending for support on their salaries, owning little or no real property; few have been business men none have been exploiters, and while there have been wide differences of ultimate ideal these leaders on the whole have worked unselfishly for the uplift of the masses of Negro folk.\nThere is no group of leaders on earth who have so largely made common cause with the lowest of their race as educated American Negroes, and it is their foresight and sacrifice and theirs alone that has saved the American freedman from annihilation and degradation.\nThis is the class of leaders who have directed and organized and defended black folk in America and whatever their shortcomings and mistakes—and they are legion—their one great proof of success is the survival of the American Negro as the most intelligent and effective group of colored people fighting white civilization face to face and on its own ground, on the face of the earth.\nThe quintessence and final expression of this leadership is the N.A.A.C.P. For twenty years it has fought a battle more desperate than any other race conflict of modern times and it has fought with honesty and courage. It deserves from Russia something better than a kick in the back from the young jackasses who are leading Communism in America today."

On this platform we have succeeded in uniting white and black, employers and laborers, capitalists and communists, socialists and reformers, rich and poor.

On the other hand, we know perfectly well that the platform of the N.A.A.C.P. is no complete program of social reform. It is a pragmatic union of certain definite problems, while far beyond its program lies the whole question of the future of the darker races and the economic emancipation of the working classes."

    "text": "White Labor\nBeyond the Scottsboro cases and the slurs on Negro leadership, there still remains for Negroes and Communists, the pressing major question: How shall American Negroes be emancipated from economic slavery? In answer to this both Socialists and Communists attempt to show the Negro that his interest lies with that of white labor. That kind of talk to the American Negro is like a red rag to a bull. Throughout the history of the Negro in America, white labor has been the black man’s enemy, his oppressor, his red murderer. Mobs, riots and the discrimination of trade unions have been used to kill, harass and starve black men, White labor disfranchised Negro labor in the South, is keeping them out of jobs and decent living quarters in the North, and is curtailing their education and civil and social privileges throughout the nation. White laborers have formed the backbone of the Ku Klux Klan and have furnished hands and ropes to lynch 3,560 Negroes since 1882.\nSince the death of Terence Powderly not a single great white labor leader in the United States has wholeheartedly and honestly espoused the cause of justice to black workers.\nSocialists and Communists explain this easily: white labor in its ignorance and poverty has been misled by the propaganda of white capital, whose policy is to divide labor, into classes, races and unions and pit one against the other. There is an immense amount of truth in this explanation: Newspapers, social standards, race pride, competition for jobs, all work to set white against black. But white American laborers are not fools. And with few exceptions the more intelligent they are, the higher they rise, the more efficient they become, the more determined they are to keep Negroes under their heels. It is no mere coincidence that Labor’s present representative in the President’s cabinet belongs to a union that will not admit a Negro, and himself was for years active in West Virginia in driving Negroes out of decent jobs. It is intelligent white labor that today keeps Negroes out of the trades, refuses them decent homes to live in and helps nullify their vote. Whatever ideals white labor today stives for in America, it would surrender nearly every one before it would recognize a Negro as a man."

    "text": "Communists and the Color Line\nAmerican Communists have made a courageous fight against the color line among the workers. They have solicited and admitted Negro members. They have insisted in their strikes and agitation to let Negroes fight with them and that the object of their fighting is for black workers as well as white workers. But in this they have gone dead against the thought and desire of the overwhelming mass of white workers, and face today a dead blank wall even in their own school in Arkansas. Thereupon instead of acknowledging defeat in their effort to make white labor abolish the color line, they turn and accuse Negroes of not sympathizing with the ideals of Labor!\nSocialists have been franker. They learned that American labor would not carry the Negro and they very calmly unloaded him. They allude to him vaguely and as an afterthought in their books and platforms. The American Socialist party is out to emancipate the white worker and if this does not automatically free the colored man, he can continue in slavery. The only time that so fine a man and so logical a reasoner as Norman Thomas becomes vague and incoherent is when he touches the black man, and consequently he touches him as seldom as possible.\nWhen, therefore, Negro leaders refuse to lay down arms and surrender their brains and action to “Nigger” hating white workers, liberals and socialists understand exactly the reasons for this and spend what energy they can spare in pointing out to white workers the necessity of recognizing Negroes. But the Communists, younger and newer, largely of foreign extraction, and thus discounting the hell of American prejudice, easily are led to blame the Negroes and to try to explain the intolerable American situation on the basis of an imported Marxist pattern, which does not at all fit the situation.\nFor instance, from Moscow comes this statement to explain Scottsboro and Camp Hill:\n\nAgain, as in the case of Sacco and Vanzetti, the American Bourgeoisie is attempting to go against proletarian social opinion. It is attempting to carry through its criminal provocation to the very end.\n\nThis is a ludicrous misapprehension of local conditions and illustrates the error into which long distance interpretation, unsupported by real knowledge, may fall. The Sacco-Vanzetti cases in Massachusetts represented the fight of prejudiced, entrenched capital against radical propaganda; but in Jackson County, northeastern Alabama, where Scottsboro is situated, there are over 33,000 Native whites and less than 3,000 Negroes. The vast majority of these whites belong to the laboring class and they formed the white proletarian mob which is determined to kill the eight Negro boys. Such mobs of white workers demand the right to kill “niggers” whenever their passions, especially in sexual matters, are inflamed by propaganda. The capitalists are willing to curb this blood lust when it interferes with their profits. They know that the murder of 8 innocent black boys will hurt organized industry and government in Alabama; but as long as 10,000 armed white workers demand these victims they do not dare move. Into this delicate and contradictory situation, the Communists hurl themselves and pretend to speak for the workers. They not only do not speak for the white workers but they even intensify the blind prejudices of these lynchers and leave the Negro workers helpless on the one hand and the white capitalists scared to death on the other.\nThe persons who are killing blacks in Northern Alabama and demanding blood sacrifice are the white workers—sharecroppers, trade unionists and artisans. The capitalists are against mob-law and violence and would listen to reason and justice in the long run because industrial peace increases their profits. On the other hand, the white workers want to kill the competition of “Niggers.” Thereupon, the Communists, seizing leadership of the poorest and most ignorant blacks head them toward inevitable slaughter and jail-slavery, while they hide safely in Chattanooga and Harlem.\nAmerican Negroes do not propose to be the shock troops of the Communist Revolution, driven out in front to death, cruelty and humiliation in order to win victories for white workers. They are picking no chestnuts from the fire, neither for capital nor white labor.\nNegroes know perfectly well that whenever they try to lead revolution in America, the nation will unite as one fist to crush them and them alone. There is no conceivable idea that seems to the present overwhelming majority of Americans higher than keeping Negroes “in their place.”\nNegroes perceive clearly that the real interests of the white worker are identical with the interests of the black worker; but until the white worker recognizes this, the black worker is compelled in sheer self-defense to refuse to be made the sacrificial goat."

    "text": "The Negro and the Rich\nThe remaining grain of truth in the Communist attack on Negro leadership is the well-known fact that American wealth has helped the American Negro and that without this help the Negro could not have attained his present advancement. American courts from the Supreme Court down are dominated by wealth and Big Business, yet they are today the Negro’s only protection against complete disfranchisement, segregation and the abolition of his public schools. Higher education for Negroes is the gift of the Standard Oil, the Power Trust, the Steel Trust and the Mail Order Chain Stores, together with the aristocratic Christian Church; but these have given Negroes 40,000 black leaders to fight white folk on their own level and in their own language. Big industry in the last 10 years has opened occupations for a million Negro workers, without which we would have starved in jails and gutters.\nSocialists and Communists may sneer and say that the capitalists sought in all this profit, cheap labor, strike-breakers and the training of conservative, reactionary leaders. They did. 3ut Negroes sought food, clothes, shelter and knowledge to stave off death and slavery and only damned fools would have refused the gift.\nMoreover, we who receive education as the dole of the rich have not all become slaves of wealth.\nMeanwhile, what have white workers and radical reformers done for Negroes? By strikes and agitation, by self-denial and sacrifice, they have raised wages and bettered working conditions; but they did this for themselves and only shared their gains with Negroes when they had to. They have preached freedom, political power, manhood rights and social uplift for everybody, when nobody objected; but for “white people only” when anybody demanded it. White labor segregated Dr. Sweet in Detroit; white laborers chased the Arkansas peons; white laborers steal the black children’s school funds in South Carolina, white laborers lynch Negroes in Alabama. Negroes owe much to white labor but it is not all, or mostly, on the credit side of the ledger."

It must change and fall if civilization survives. The foundation of its present world-wide power is the slavery and semislavery of the colored world including the American Negroes. Until the colored man, yellow, red, brown and black, becomes free, articulate, intelligent and the receiver of a decent income, white capital will use the profit derived from his degradation to keep white labor in chains.\nThere is no doubt, then, as to the future, or as to where the true interests of American Negroes lie. There is no doubt, too, but that the first step toward the emancipation of colored labor must come from white labor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTen Years (1927)\nThe Negro and Radical Thought (1921)\nJudging Russia (1927)\nThe Spread of Socialism (1921)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)"

King, Julian Harris, Dr. Edward W. Odum, and Alexander Spence. The colored members are: Dr. R. R. Moton, Dr. John Hope, Dr. Charles S. Johnson, President B. F. Hubert and Professor John Work.\nAt the same time, we know the temptation that faces such a committee working in the South. They are almost forced to be diplomatic before they are absolutely truthful. We trust, therefore, that they are going to be brave enough to say this plain word about lynching: the cause of lynching lies in ignorance, economic exploitation, religious intolerance, political disfranchisement, and sex prejudice.\nThe ignorance still forced on the colored South and still allowed in the white South is stupendous. Economic exploitation, including actual peonage on the plantations of the Gulf States and the Mississippi Valley, is a perfectly well-known fact. Political disfranchisement puts the selection of officials who enforce the law largely in the hands of the white mob. Religious intolerance is making hypocrites of Southern white Christians and allowing them to recite the Golden Rule with one side of their mouths and shriek “Kill the Nigger!” with the other. And finally, lynching has always been used and is still being used to stop sexual intercourse between colored men and white women, whether by consent or not. Every anti intermarriage law of the South is a cause of lynching and an affront to civilization. God only knows how many black men accused of rape have been done to death by mobs simply because they chose a willing white paramour or were chosen by one. There is no use blinking these facts. They are true.

    "text": "As a magnificent essay in valiant timidity we recommend Mr. Theodore Roosevelt’s “Brazil and the Negro” in the Outlook. The story which he has to tell is simple: There are in Brazil 8,300,000 Negroes and mulattoes; 3,700,000 Indian and mixed Indian-whites and 8,000,000 persons of European descent. All these elements are fusing into one light mulatto race.\nThese are the simple facts. Mr. Roosevelt has hitherto rather ostentatiously avoided them. He visited Rio Janeiro, with a Negroid population in the hundred thousands, and almost overlooked them; he visited Bahia, if we mistake not, which has more Negroes than any city in the world, and quite forgot them.\nAt last, however, Mr. Roosevelt coyly approaches his subject. The editors warn away the frivolous with these protesting italics: “It may be noted that in this article Mr. Roosevelt is not attempting to justify or condemn the Brazilian attitude toward the Negro as contrasted with that of the United States, but simply to set forth clearly what the Brazilian attitude is in fact.”\nMr. Roosevelt then, in characteristic fashion, states three facts and two falsehoods.\nThe facts are:\n\nBrazil is absorbing the Negro race.\nThere is no color bar to advancement.\nThere is no social bar to advancement, but the mass of full-blooded Negroes are still in the lower social class.\n\nThen come the falsehoods: 1. The best men in the United States believe “in treating each man of whatever color absolutely on his worth as a man, allowing him full opportunity to achieve the success warranted by his ability and integrity, and giving to him the full measure of respect to which that success entitles him.” This is not so and Mr. Roosevelt knows it is not so. The best men in the United States believe that their “civilization” can only be maintained by compelling all persons of Negro descent to occupy an inferior place. The exceptions to this belief are negligible. 2. That the Brazilians regard the Negro element in their blood as “a slight weakening.” What do Brazilians say as to this “slight weakening”? We quote from Dr. Jean Baptiste de Lacerda, director of the National Museum of Rio Janeiro:\n\nThe metis of Brazil have given birth down to our own time to poets of no mean inspiration, painters, sculptors, distinguished musicians, magistrates, lawyers, eloquent orators, remarkable writers, medical men and engineers, who have been unrivaled in the technical skill and professional ability. * * *\n\nThe co-operation of the metis in the advance of Brazil is notorious and far from inconsiderable. They played the chief part during many years in Brazil in the campaign for the abolition of slavery. I could quote celebrated names of more than one of these metis who put themselves at the head of the literary movement. They fought with firmness and intrepidity in the press and on the platform. They faced with courage the greatest perils to which they were exposed in their struggle against the powerful slave owners, who had the protection of a conservative government. They gave evidence of sentiments of patriotism, self-denial and appreciation during the long campaign in Paraguay, fighting heroically at the boarding of the ships in the canal battle of Riachuelo and in the attacks of the Brazilian army, on numerous occasions in the course of this long South American war. It was owing to their support that the republic was erected on the ruins of the empire.\n\nAnd what of all this? Is it not a plea for intermarriage of whites and blacks in the United States? It is not. It is a plea for truth. It is a denial that lying will settle any human problem. Most white people in the United States prefer to marry white people. That is perfectly proper and defensible. Most colored people prefer to marry colored people. This is perfectly logical and commendable. These facts need no defense and need no proof. They are the easily understandable desire of both races.\nBut a vast number of people are not satisfied with such bare facts. They want to bolster them up with scientific lies and social insult. They want to scare and beat people into doing precisely what people would do without bogies and force, and the result is that they not only accomplish what they wish, but they also accomplish poverty, crime, prostitution, ignorance, lynching, mob violence and the ruin of democratic government for the unfortunate victims of their lies. All this is clear, but to expect Theodore Roosevelt to say it plainly without twistings and equivocation is to expect the millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPan-Africa and New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nThe Rise of the West Indian (1920)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nAfrica for the Africans (1921)\nLight (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “Brazil.” The Crisis 7 (6):\n286–87. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/07/06/brazil.html."

There was, for instance, a few years ago, a solution of the Negro problem so ridiculously simple that those who did not receive it as gospel were hooted if not stoned. The gist was this:\n\nThe Negro must work out his own salvation.\nThe Negro must make himself useful to his neighbors.\nThe Negro must not complain.\nDuties must be taught Negroes — never mind their rights.\nNegroes must let politics alone.\nMoney talks — let the Negro get a $5,000 brick house and his individual problem is solved.\nEtc., etc.\n\nAll this the Negro has done. He has striven to solve his problems unaided. He is so useful to his neighbors that the problem of to-morrow will be the Southern millionaire waxed fat on the starvation wages of black peons.\nThe mass of Negroes has been so ground down and oppressed that they do not know what complaint is. If they did, segregation, the “Jim Crow” car and disfranchisement would disappear to-morrow. We have shivered in the storm like dumb driven cattle and forgotten our rights before we learned them.

    "text": "The comet was blazing down from the sky on the midnight before Christmas. Three songs were dying away in the East: one from the rich and ornate chapel of the great cathedral on the hills beyond 110th Street—a song of beauty and exquisite finish but coldly and formally sung. Another, a chant from the dim synagogue on the lower East Side—heavy with droning and passionate; the last from West 53d Street—a minor wail of utter melody. The songs had died away and the three priests, looking at the midnight sky, saw the comet at the same moment. The priest in the ornate chapel, gowned in his silken vestments, paused and stared wonderingly at the star; it seemed drawing near to him and guiding him. Almost before he knew it he had thrown a rich fur cloak about himself and was whirling downtown in a taxicab, watching the star with fascinated gaze. The rabbi on the lower East Side no sooner saw that blaze in the heavens than a low cry of joy left his lips and he followed swiftly, boarding a passing Grand Street car and changing up Broadway; he hung on the footboard to watch unmindful of the gibes at his white beard and Jewish gabardine. The old black preacher of 53d Street, with sad and wrinkled face, looked at the moving star thoughtfully and walked slowly with it. So the three men threaded the maize of the Christmas-mad streets, neither looking on the surging crowds nor listening to the shouts of the people, but seeing only the star. The “honk, honk” of the priest’s taxicab warned the black priest scarcely too soon, and he staggered with difficulty aside as it whizzed by and made the motorman of the car, which bore the Jew, swear at the carelessness of the chauffeur. One flew, the other whirred swiftly and the third walked slowly; yet because of their differing ways they all came to the steps of the great apartment house at the same moment, and they bowed gravely to each other, yet not without curiosity, as each ascended the steps. The porter was strangely deferential and they rose swiftly to the seventh floor, where a wide hall door flew silently open.\nWithin and before the wide log fire of the drawing room sat a woman. She was tall and shapely and well gowned. She sat alone. The guests had gone an hour since and the last footsteps of the servants were echoing above; yet she sat there weary, still gazing into the mystery of the fire. She had seen many Christmas Eves and they were growing all to be alike—wretchedly alike. All equally lonely, aimless—almost artificial. She arose once and walked to the window, sweeping aside the heavy curtains, and the brilliancy of the star blazed in upon her. She looked upon it with a start. She remembered how once long, long years ago she had looked upon stars and such things as very real and shining fingers of fate. She remembered especially on a night like this how some such star had told her future. How out of her soul wonderful things were to be born, and she had said unto the star: “How shall this be?” And something had answered: “That holy thing that shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.” And then she had cried in all her maiden faith and mystery: “Behold the hand-maiden of the Lord, be it according to thy word.” And the angel departed from her, and it never came back again. Here she was reaching the portals of middle age with no prospects and few ambitions; to live and wait and sleep; to work a soulless work, to eat in some great manger like this—that was the life that seemed stretching before her endless and without change, until the End and the Change of Changing. And yet she had dreamed such dreams and fancied such fair destiny! As she thought of these dreams to-night a tear gathered and wandered down her face. It was then that she became suddenly aware of two men standing on either side of her, and she felt, but did not see, a third man, who stood behind. But for the soft voice of the first speaker she would have sprung up in alarm, but he was an old man and deferential with soft ascetic Jewish face, with white-forked beard and gabardine, and he bowed in deep humility as he spoke, saying:\n“Where is He that is born King of the Jews, for we have seen His star in the East, and have come to worship Him?”\nThe other surpliced figure, who stood upon her right hand, said the same thing, only less:\n“Where is He who is born King, for we have seen His star in the East, and have come to worship Him?” And scarcely had his voice ceased than the strong low rolling of another voice came from behind, saying:\n“Where is He, for we have seen His star in the East, and have come to worship Him?”\nShe sank back in her chair and smiled. There was evidently some mistake, and she said to the Jew courteously:\n“There is no King here.”\n“But,” said the Jew, eagerly, tremulously, “it is a child we seek, and the star has guided us hither; we have brought gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.” Still the woman shook her head.\n“Children are not allowed in these apartments,” she said, “and besides, I am unwed.”\nThe face of the Jew grew radiant.\n“The Scriptures say He shall be born of a Virgin,” he chanted. But the woman smiled bitterly.\n“The children of Virgins are not welcome in the twentieth century, even though they be Sons of God!”\n“And in a manger,” continued the Jew.\n“This is, indeed, a manger,” laughed the woman, “but He is not here—He is not here—only—cattle feed here.”\nThen the silk-robed priest on the left interrupted:\n“You do not understand,” he said, “it is not a child of the body we seek, but of the Word. The Word which was with God and the Word which was God. We seek the illuminating truth which shall settle all our wild gropings and bring light to this blind world.” But the woman laughed even more bitterly.\n“I was foolish enough once to think,” she said, “that out of my brain would leap some wondrous illuminating word which should give light and warmth to the world, but nothing has been born, save here and there an epigram and the smartness of a phrase. No, He is not here.”\nThe surpliced priest drew back with disappointed mien, and then suddenly, in the face of priest and Jew, as they turned toward the unseen figure at her back, she saw the birth of new and wonderful comprehension—Jew and Gentile sank to their knees—and she heard a soft and mighty voice that came up out of the shadows behind her as she bent forward, almost crouching, and it said:\n“Him whom we seek is child neither of thy body nor of thy brain, but of thy heart. Strong Son of God, immortal love. We seek not the king of the world nor the light of the world, but the love of the world, and of all men, for all men; and lo! this thou bearest beneath thy heart, O woman of mankind. This night it shall be born!”\nSlowly her heart rose and surged within her as she struggled to her feet; a wonderful revelation lighted in her whirling brain. She, of all women; she, the chosen one—the bride of Almighty God; her lips babbled noiselessly searching for that old and saintly hymn: “My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God, my saviour. For he hath regarded the low estate of his hand-maiden, for behold! from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.” A great new strength gripped her limbs. Slowly she arose, and as she rose, the roof rose silently with her—the walls of the vast room widened—the cold wet pavement touched her satined feet, and the pale-blue brilliance of the star rained on her coiled hair and naked shoulders. The shouting, careless, noisy midnight crowds surged by and brushed her gown. Slowly she turned herself, with strange new gladness in her heart, and the last words of the hymn on her lips: “He hath put down the Mighty from their seats and hath exalted them of low degree; he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away.” She turned, and lo! before her stood that third figure, an old, bent black man, sad faced and pitiful, and yet with brilliant caverned eyes and mighty wings that curved to Heaven. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:\n“Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace, good will toward men.”\nSELAH!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEaster-Emancipation 1863-1913 (1913)\nThe Quadroon (1911)\nUnrest (1920)\nThe Second Coming (1917)\nJoseph Pulitzer (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “The Three Wise Men.”\nThe Crisis 7 (2): 80–82. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/07/02/three_wise_men.html."

    "text": "The Washington Bee, a weekly colored periodical has been stirred to its vitals by the fear that the money collected in Washington and elsewhere for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is going to be used for the support of The Crisis We assure the editor that not a single cent of such moneys goes to the support of The Crisis. The Crisis supports itself, and has from the beginning, with the single exception that the association provides an editor for it.\nEven this, however, does not apparently suit the nimble Bee. “But the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ignores the splendid, vitalizing work of the race newspapers already established, and established and financed by their editors, while concentrating its efforts and giving of its funds exclusively to make The Crisis a very late comer, the real and only organ of the race.” Here again the editor is mistaken. Far from displacing the colored weekly newspapers, The Crisis is giving them all possible publicity and full and careful credit for everything which it reprints.\nThe Crisis regrets, however, that the amount of matter published in the Bee and in many other papers, which is worth, reprinting or even reading, is not nearly as large as it ought to be. Moreover, The Crisis is convinced that more careful attention to some of the very things which this editor denounces would bring larger success to the colored weekly papers.\nFirst: Facts. Of the newspapers mentioned only one, the Afro-American Ledger, makes a careful and valuable attempt to present the facts concerning the Negro. The others present some of the facts, but in a partial and incomplete way.\nSecond: English. Some of the best of colored papers are so wretchedly careless in their use of the English language and sense of the value of words that when they see English they are apt to mistake it for something which the Bee mysteriously characterizes as “Oscar Wilde atomized sentences,” whatever that may be.\nBut third and most important: Few of the colored weekly papers have stood staunch for principle. Outside the Guardian and the Cleveland Gazette there have not been more than one or two colored papers from whom the Negro people could expect year in and year out strong, staunch advocacy of the fundamental principles of freedom and justice. Small wonder that they welcome a periodical which (whatever its many faults may-be) at least tries to give the facts, talk English and stand as an unpurchasablc advocate of justice and right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nOther Organizations (1915)\nThe Crisis (1910)\nWe Come of Age (1915)\nThe New Crisis (1925)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “Booming The Crisis.”\nThe Crisis 7 (5): 239–40. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/07/05/booming_crisis.html."

    "text": "“Disfranchise the Negro, give him an education and full rights of work and property. This will settle the Negro problem.” Such was the argument put forward in 1890 when Mississippi began the nullification of the United States Constitution.\nWhat has been the result? The Negro problem is not settled despite the fact that nine-tenths of the colored men, 21 years of age and over, have lost their votes in the Gulf States. Education has been restricted, cheapened and lowered in efficiency, and most Negro children of school age are out of school. Low wages and caste restrictions hamper the Negro worker and show little abatement.\nAnd the right to hold property? Even this is being openly attacked. In Southern and border cities a half dozen ordinances are making it difficult or impossible for Negroes to purchase city homes.\nBut there is the rural South, the haven of refuge for all true black men, if they read the Gospel according to our best friends correctly. And yet listen to this, by Clarence Poe, of North Carolina, editor of the widely read Progressive Farmer:\n\nI have received hundreds and hundreds of letters, representing fifteen States, endorsing the plan of race segregation I advocated on this page, August 30. …\n \nThe law I advocated August 30, it will be remembered, was just this: ‘Whenever the greater part of the land acreage in any given district that may be laid off is owned by one race, a majority of the voters in such a district may say, if they wish, that in future no land shall be sold to a person of a different race; provided such action is approved or allowed (as being justified by considerations of the peace, protection and social life of the community) by a reviewing judge or board of county commissioners.’\n \nSuch a board, as I have said, could be used by any white community to keep itself white, but the Negro would almost never be able to use it to make a community wholly Negro. If you are in favor of such a plan and want to know more about it, send me a postal card or letter at once.\n\nWhat is the reason of all this?

    "text": "Should I become President of the United States, they (the colored people) may count on me for absolute fair dealing and for everything by which I could assist in advancing the interests of their race in the United States.\n\nThese were Mr. Wilson’s words October 16, 1912. Why has the President failed to keep them?\nIt is not because he did not mean them. He did mean what he said. But Mr. Wilson is seeking to keep his party intact for carrying through certain legislation. That party in Congress consists to-day of 290 Representatives and 51 Senators, against an opposition of 127 Representatives and 45 Senators. Moreover, the President’s party of 341 includes 115 Senators and Representatives from former slave States.\nIf these 115 members withdrew their support Mr. Wilson’s party would be a minority of 226 votes against 287. For his policies, therefore, Mr. Wilson must have the solid South, and the solid South has but one political tenet: “Down with Niggers!”\nBut how is it that the solid South is numerically so strong in Congress? Because it represents not simply 16,000,000 white Southerners, but 8,000,000 disfranchised blacks. Thus the disfranchisement of blacks gives the Southern whites a club to beat them with.\nNot only that, but it gives the Southern whites an abnormal advantage over the Northern voters. This is easy to prove:\nIn ten Southern States it took, in 1912, 1,110,034 votes to elect 94 Congressmen. In the rest of the United States it took 13,926,508 votes to elect 323 Congressmen. In other words, 43,116 ignorant and low-down Northerners and Westerners are necessary to elect a representative to Congress, but only 11,808 aristocratic and wise white Southerners are needed to seat a Negro hater in our highest legislature. No wonder the South is in the saddle when it wields four times the political power of the North!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAn Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson (1913)\nPresidential Candidates (1916)\nEducation (1913)\nThe President (1915)\nThe Election (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “The South in the Saddle.”\nThe Crisis 7 (4): 188. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/07/04/south_in_saddle.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was organized it seemed to us that the subject of “social equality” between races was not one that we need touch officially whatever our private opinions might be. We announced clearly our object as being the political and civil rights of Negroes and this seemed to us a sufficiently clear explanation of our work.\nWe soon found, however, certain difficulties: Was the right to attend a theatre a civil or a social right? Is a hotel a private or a public institution? What should be our stand as to public travel or public celebrations or public dinners to discuss social uplift? And above all, should we be silent when laws were proposed taking away from a white father all legal responsibility for his colored child?\nMoreover, no matter what our attitude, acts and clear statements have been, we were continually being “accused” of advocating “social equality” and back of the accusations were implied the most astonishing assumptions: our secretary was assaulted in Texas for “advocating social equality” when in fact he was present to prove that we were a legal organization under Texas law. Attempts were made in North Carolina to forbid a state school from advertising in our organ The Crisis on the ground that “now and then it injects a note of social equality” and in general we have seen theft, injustice, lynchings, riot and murder based on “accusations” or attempts at “social equality.”\nThe time has, therefore, evidently come for The Crisis to take a public stand on this question in the interest of Justice and clear thinking. Let us openly define our terms and beliefs and let there be no further unjustifiable reticence on our part or underground skulking by enemies of the Negro race. This statement does not imply any change of attitude on our part; it simply means a clear and formal expression on matters which hitherto we have mistakenly assumed were unimportant in their relation to our main work.\nWe make this statement, too, the more willingly because recent events lead us to realize that there lurks in the use and the misuse of the phrase “social equality” much of the same virus that for thousands of years has separated and insulted and injured men of many races and groups and social classes.\nWe believe that social equality, by a reasonable interpretation of the words, means moral, mental and physical fitness to associate with one’s fellowmen. In this sense The Crisis believes absolutely in the Social Equality of the Black and White and Yellow races and it believes too that any attempt to deny this equality by law or custom is a blow at Humanity, Religion and Democracy.\nNo sooner is this incontestable statement made, however, than many minds immediately adduce further implications: they say that such a statement and belief implies the right of black folk to force themselves into the private social life of whites and to intermarry with them.\nThis is a forced and illogical definition of social equality. Social equals, even in the narrowest sense of the term, do not have the right to be invited to, or attend private receptions, or to marry persons who do not wish to marry them. Such a right would imply not mere equality—it would mean superiority. Such rights inhere in reigning monarchs in certain times and countries, but no man, black or white, ever dreamed of claiming a right to invade the private social life of any man.\nOn the other hand, every self-respecting person does claim the right to mingle with his fellows if he is invited and to be free from insult or hindrance because of his presence. When, therefore, the public is invited, or when he is privately invited to social gatherings, the Negro has a right to accept and no other guest has a right to complain; they have only the right to absent themselves. The late Booker T. Washington could hardly be called an advocate of “social equality” in any sense and yet he repeatedly accepted invitations to private and public functions and certainly had the right to.\nTo the question of intermarriage there are three aspects:\n\nThe individual right\nThe social expediency\nThe physical result\n\nAs to the individual right of any two sane grown individuals of any race to marry there can be no denial in any civilized land. The moral results of any attempt to deny this right are too terrible and of this the southern United States is an awful and abiding example. Either white people and black people want to mingle sexually or they do not. If they do, no law will stop them and attempted laws are cruel, inhuman and immoral. If they do not, no laws are necessary.\nBut above the individual problem lies the question of the social expediency of the intermarriage of whites and blacks today in America. The answer to this is perfectly clear: it is not socially expedient today for such marriages to take place; the reasons are evident: where there are great differences of ideal, culture, taste and public esteem, the intermarriage of groups is unwise because it involves too great a strain to evolve a compatible, agreeable family life and to train up proper children. On this point there is almost complete agreement among colored and white people and the strong opinion here is not only that of the whites—it is the growing determination of the blacks to accept no alliances so long as there is any shadow of condescension; and to build a great black race tradition of which the Negro and the world will be as proud in the future as it has been in the ancient world.\nThe Crisis, therefore, most emphatically advises against race intermarriage in America but it does so while maintaining the moral and legal right of individuals who may think otherwise and it most emphatically refuses to base its opposition on other than social grounds.\nThe Crisisdoes not believe, for instance, that the intermarriage of races is physically criminal or deleterious. The overwhelming weight of scientific opinion and human experience is against this assumption and it is a cruel insult to seek to transmute a perfectly permissible social taste or thoughtful social advice into a confession or accusation of physical inferiority and contamination.\nTo sum up then: The Crisis advises strongly against interracial marriage in the United States today because of social conditions and prejudice and not for physical reasons; at the same time it maintains absolute legal right of such marriage for such as will, for the simple reason that any other solution is immoral and dangerous.\nThe Crisis does not for a moment believe that any man has a right to force his company on others in their private lives but it maintains just as strongly that the right of any man to associate privately with those who wish to associate with him and publicly with anybody so long as he conducts himself gently, is the most fundamental right of a Human Being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nSocial Equality (1919)\n‘Social Equality’ (1911)\nSocial Equality (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “The Social Equality of Whites and\nBlacks.” The Crisis 21 (1): 18, 20. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/21/01/social_equality_of_blacks_and_whites.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Marcus Garvey was born at St. Ann’s Bay, Jamaica, about 1885. He was educated at the public school and then for a short time attended the Church of England Grammar School, although he was a Roman Catholic by religion. On leaving school he learned the printing trade and followed it for many years. In Costa Rica he was associated with Marclam Taylor in publishing the Bluefield’s Messenger. Later he was on the staff of La Nacion. He then returned to Jamaica and worked as a printer, being foreman of the printing department of P. Benjamin’s Manufacturing Company of Kingston. Later he visited Europe and spent some time in England and France and while abroad conceived his scheme of organizing the Negro Improvement Society. This society was launched August 1, 1914, in Jamaica, with these general objects among others:\n“To establish a Universal Confraternity among the race;” “to promote the spirit of race pride and love;” “to administer to and assist the needy;” “to strengthen the imperialism of independent African States;” “to conduct a world-wide commercial and industrial intercourse.”\nHis first practical object was to be the establishment of a farm school. Meetings were held and the Roman Catholic Bishop, the Mayor of Kingston, and many others addressed them. Nevertheless the project did not succeed and Mr. Garvey was soon in financial difficulties. He therefore practically abandoned the Jamaica field and came to the United States. In the United States his movement for many years lanuished until at last with the increased migration from the West Indies during the war he succeeded in establishing a strong nucleus in the Harlem district of New York City.\nHis program now enlarged and changed somewhat in emphasis. He began especially to emphasize the commercial development of the Negroes and as an islander familiar with the necessities of ship traffic he planned the “Black Star Line.” The public for a long time regarded this as simply a scheme of exploitation, when they were startled by hearing that Garvey had bought a ship. This boat was a former coasting vessel, 32 years old, but it was put into commission with a black crew and a black captain and was announced as the first of a fleet of vessels which would trade between the colored peoples of America, the West Indies and Africa. With this beginning, the popularity and reputation of Mr. Garvey and his association increased quickly.\nIn addition to the Yarmouth he is said to have purchased two small boats, the Shadyside, a small excursion steamer which made daily excursions up the Hudson, and a yacht which was designed to cruise among the West Indies and collect cargo in some central spot for the Yarmouth. He had first announced the Black Star Line as a Five Million Dollar corporation, but in February, 1920, he announced that it was going to be a Ten Million Dollar corporation with shares selling at Five Dollars. To this he added in a few months the Negro Factories Corporation capitalized at One Million Dollars with two hundred thousand one dollar shares, and finally he announced the subscription of Five Million Dollars to free Liberia and Haiti from debt.\nEarly in 1920 he called a convention of Negroes to meet in New York City from the 1st to the 31st of August, “to outline a constructive plan and program for the uplifting of the Negroes and the redemption of Africa.” He also took title to three apartment houses to be used as offices and purchased the foundation of an unfinished Baptist church which he covered over and used for meetings, calling it “Liberty Hall.” In August, 1920, his convention met with representatives from various parts of the United States, several of the West India Islands and the Canal Zone and a few from Africa. The convention carried out its plan of a month’s meetings and culminated with a mass meeting which filled Madison Square Garden. Finally the convention adopted a “Declaration of Independence” with 66 articles, a universal anthem and colors,—red, black and green—and elected Mr. Garvey as “His Excellency, the Provisional President of Africa,” together with a number of various other leaders from the various parts of the Negro world. This in brief is the history of the Garvey movement.\nThe question comes (1) Is it an honest, sincere movement? (2) Are its industrial and commercial projects business like and effective? (3) Are its general objects plausible and capable of being carried out?\nThe central and dynamic force of the movement is Garvey. He has with singular success capitalized and made vocal the great and long suffering grievances and spirit of protest among the West Indian peasantry. Hitherto the black peasantry of the West Indies has been almost leaderless. Its natural leaders, both mulatto and black, have crossed the color line and practically obliterated social distinction, and to some extent economic distinction, between them and the white English world on the Islands. This has left a peasantry with only the rudiments of education and with almost no economic chances, grovelling at the bottom. Their distress and needs gave Garvey his vision.\nIt is a little difficult to characterize the man Garvey. He has been charged with dishonesty and graft, but he seems to me essentially an honest and sincere man with a tremendous vision, great dynamic force, stubborn determination and unselfish desire to serve; but also he has very serious defects of temperament and training: he is dictatorial, domineering, inordinately vain and very suspicious. He cannot get on with his fellow-workers. His entourage has continually changed.1 He has had endless law suits and some cases of fisticuffs with his subordinates and has even divorced the young wife whom he married with great fanfare of trumpets about a year ago. All these things militate against him and his reputation. Nevertheless I have not found the slightest proof that his objects were not sincere or that he was consciously diverting money to his own uses. The great difficulty with him is that he has absolutely no business sense, no flair for real organization and his general objects are so shot through with bombast and exaggeration that it is difficult to pin them down for careful examination.\nOn the other hand, Garvey is an extraordinary leader of men. Thousands of people believe in him. He is able to stir them with singular eloquence and the general run of his thought is of a high plane. He has become to thousands of people a sort of religion. He allows and encourages all sorts of personal adulation, even printing in his paper the addresses of some of the delegates who hailed him as “His Majesty.” He dons on state occasion, a costume consisting of an academic cap and gown flounced in red and green!\nOf Garvey’s curious credulity and suspicions one example will suffice: In March, 1919, he held a large mass meeting at Palace Casino which was presided over by Chandler Owen and addressed by himself and Phillip Randolph. Here he collected $204 in contributions on the plea that while in France, W. E. B. DuBois had interfered with the work of his “High Commissioner” by “defeating” his articles in the French press and “repudiating” his statements as to lynching and injustice in America! The truth was that Mr. DuBois never saw or heard of his “High Commissioner,” never denied his nor anyone’s statements of the wretched American conditions, did everything possible to arouse rather than quiet the French press and would have been delighted to welcome and co-operate with any colored fellow-worker.\nTo be concluded in January."

    "text": "No people can more exactly interpret the inmost meaning of the present situation in Ireland than the American Negro. The scheme is simple. You knock a man down and then have him arrested for assault. You kill a man and then hang the corpse for murder. We black folk are only too familiar with this procedure. In a given city, a mob attacks us unprepared, unsuspecting, and kills innocent and harmless black workingmen in cold blood. The bewildered Negroes rush together and begin to defend themselves. Immediately by swift legerdemain the mob becomes the militia or a gang of “deputy sheriffs”. They search, harry and kill the Negroes. They disarm them and loot their homes, and when the city awakes after the “race riot”, the jail is filled with Negroes charged with rioting and fomenting crime!\nSo in Ireland! The Irish resist, as they have resisted for hundreds of years, various and exasperating forms of English oppression. Their resistance is called crime and under ordinary conditions would be crime; in retaliation not only the “guilty” but the innocent among them are murdered and robbed and public property is burned by English guardians of the Peace!\nAll this must bring mingled feelings of dismay to Irishmen. No people in the world have in the past gone with blither spirit to “kill niggers” from Kingston to Delhi and from Kumassi to Fiji. In the United States, Irish influence not only stood behind the mob in Cincinnati, Philadelphia and New York, but still stands in the American Federation of Labor to keep out Negro workingmen. All this contains no word of argument against the ultimate freedom of Ireland—which God speedily grant!—but it does make us remember how in this world it is the Oppressed who have continually been used to cow and kill the Oppressed in the interest of the Universal Oppressor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nIreland (1916)\nCrime (1920)\nThe Challenge of Detroit (1925)\nMob Tactics (1927)\nThe Old Story (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “Bleeding Ireland.”\nThe Crisis 21 (5): 213. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/21/05/bleeding-ireland.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "An unknown number of dead, men of property and standing forced to leave their homes and families under threat of death, thousands of qualified voters debarred from casting their ballots—these constitute a portion of the results of the elections of 1920 in the state of Florida. To that list might well be added an increased bitterness on the part of both white and colored people towards each other and another black mark entered in the books of colored people against the whites for what the former had to suffer.\nIt is not possible to write of race relations in the South today without giving due prominence to the revival of that sinister organization, the Ku Klux Klan. There is hardly a town or community to be found which does not have its branch. Certain it is that wherever one goes in the South one hears of the “Klucks” and what that order is going to do to maintain “white supremacy.” Clothed in great secrecy and hinting of dire things to come, the pretensions of the noble “protectors of southern womanhood” would be ludicrous were it not for the vicious deeds already performed by branches in some of the smaller towns and rural communities. If one looks at the Ku Klux Klan solely from the viewpoint of the larger cities of the South like Jacksonville, Atlanta and Birmingham where the Negro population is concentrated in certain sections, the efforts of the Klan are pathetically amusing and are treated as such by colored people. Forty years ago when the original Ku Klux did effective work in terrorizing, murdering and pillaging the Negroes of the South it was dealing with four million recently emancipated slaves with all of the characteristics following in the wake of two and a half centuries of human bondage. They were ignorant, superstitious, easily frightened, poorly organized, distrustful of each other and still believing that they were inferior to white men. It was a comparatively simple matter to envelop the Klan with a cloak of supernatural power and to send a colored man shivering to cover until a parade had passed.\nToday, however, the setting is changed.\nA new generation of Negroes has arisen with thousands of university, college, high school and grammar school graduates among them; possessing property and the respect for self that accompanies such possessions. I have talked with many Negroes and with many white men in the South. I have found a far higher order of intelligence among Negroes than among whites, when one compares the two races grade for grade. In regard to the Klan, even the uneducated Negro looks upon it with amused contempt. His white brother, in most cases, cherishes a fatuous belief common to provincial and circumscribed minds that terroristic methods will be efficacious in “keeping the nigger in his place.”\nIn Jacksonville, for example, a parade of the local Klan was held on Saturday night, October 30. Large numbers of colored people turned out to view the parade. One old colored woman of the antebellum type that is fast disappearing, called out derisively to the marching Klucks:\n\nWhite folks, you ain’t done nothin’. Them German guns didn’t scare us and I know them white faces ain’t goin’ to do it now.\n\nThat remark epitomizes the feeling. Phrased in better English it likewise expresses the sentiment among the larger number of educated colored citizens of Jacksonville. But beneath the amused tolerance there is a grim realization that the Klan will not spend its energy in marching—that the sinister purposes of the movement betoken no good to colored people. Negroes are prepared for trouble in every part of the South where I have been. They realize that they are outnumbered and outarmed and that death is the inevitable fate of many if clashes come.\nThe situation in the smaller towns and isolated rural communities where the Negro population is widely scattered is of a more serious nature. There the Klans can wreak their vengeance on any Negro who dares offend them by being too prosperous or being suspected of some crime, great or small, or by incurring the displeasure of any white man of the community. This vengeance extends to white men who offend some loyal member of a Klan or who dares show too great friendliness for Negroes—whether for selfish or other motives. It is not considered improper but just the contrary for a white man or boy to debauch or consort with a colored woman, but no white man can treat a Negro as an equal, As a case in point read a Klan warning sent to a prominent white lawyer of a Florida town who advised Negroes to qualify, register and vote in the recent election. It reads:\n\nWe have been informed that you have been telling Negroes to register, explaining to them how to become citizens and how to assert their rights.\n\nIf you know the history of reconstruction days following the Civil War, you know how the “scalawags” of the North and the black republicans of the South did much as you are doing to instill into the Negro the idea of social equality. You will remember that these things forced the loyal citizens of the South to form clans of determined men to maintain white supremacy and to safeguard our women and children.\n\nAnd now you know that history repeats itself and that he who resorts to your kind of a game is handling edged tools. We shall always enjoy WHITE SUPREMACY in this country and he who interferes must face the consequences.\n\nGRAND MASTER FLORIDA KU KLUCKS.\n\nCopy\nLocal Ku Klucks\nWatch this man.\n\nAn example of what can be done and what has been done in a small town is the election riot at Ocoee, Orange County, Florida. For weeks before November 2, word had been sent to the Negroes that no colored man would be allowed to vote. The statement was emphasized with the threat that any Negro attempting to cast his ballot would be severely punished. One colored man disregarded the warning. He was the most prominent man in his community, owned a large orange grove worth more than ten thousand dollars, his own home and an automobile. He had always borne the reputation of being a safe and sane leader among his people and had never been involved in trouble of any kind. And therein lay his unpopularity. He was too prosperous—“for a nigger.” He, Mose Norman, attempted to vote. He was beaten severely and ordered to go home. The press reports stated later that he had not paid his poll tax nor had he registered. On this point and the succeeding events, may I quote the statement of a white man of the town who said:\n\n… he was denied upon the ground that he had not paid his poll tax, when, as a matter of fact, the records of this county (if they have not been doctored since) will show that he had paid his tax. The press claimed that he made a threat that he was going home to get his gun, and see that he did vote. I do not believe that anyone, situated as he was, would have been foolhardy enough to make such a threat. After the polls closed, a number of armed men went to his house, without a warrant and without authority of law as is claimed by those approving their action, to arrest this Negro. Two white men were shot in the Negro’s backyard. From that time on for three days the community ran riot. I do not believe it will ever be known how many Negroes were killed. Every Negro home, schoolhouse, church and lodge-room in that community was burned, in some instances with women and children occupying the houses, and thus burned to death. … The foregoing is a fair sample of conditions which exist in most parts of the state.\n\nThe story is essentially as told above. When Norman left the polls he went to the home of July Perry, another colored man, who likewise was unpopular with the whites in that he was foreman of a large orange grove owned by a white man living in New England—a job which the community felt was too good for a Negro. When the mob attacked the colored community the colored people fought in self-defense, killing two white men and wounding two, according to news accounts. Citizens of the town told me that eight or ten whites were killed but that they could not allow the information to become known, fearing the effect on the colored population. However, the mob surrounded the settlement, set fire to it, shot down or forced back into the flames colored men, women and children who attempted to flee. The number murdered will probably never be known. The figures generally given varied from thirty-two to thirty-five. One lean, lanky and vicious looking white citizen of Ocoee of whom I asked the number of dead, replied:\n\nI don’t know exactly but I know fifty-six niggers were killed. I killed seventeen myself.\n\nWhatever the number, two of those known to have died, were a colored mother and her two-weeks old infant. Before the ashes of the burned houses had cooled, eager members of the mob rushed in and sought gleefully the charred bones of the victims as souvenirs. As I stood on the spot approximately seventy-two hours following the slaughter, the remains looked as though some one had gone over them with a fine-toothed comb.\nAn amazing aftermath of the occurrence was the attitude of the white inhabitants of Orange County. Talking with numbers of them, the opinion of the majority seemed to be that nothing unusual had taken place—that the white people had acquitted themselves rather meritoriously in checking: unholy and presumptuous ambitions of Negroes in attempting to vote. Even the white children of Ocoee felt that an event, similar in enjoyment to a circus had taken place. One bright-faced and alert girl of eleven when asked what had occurred, told happily of how “we had some fun burning up some niggers.” There was no thought of horror at the deed—it was accepted as a matter of course.\nSome of the methods used in the smaller towns in eliminating the Negro vote and particularly the colored woman vote were unique. In Orange and Osceola counties, a colored woman would attempt to register; on being asked her age, for example, she would say twenty-four. She would then be asked the year in which she was born. Many of them being illiterate, would not know. The registrar would then probably say, “If you are twenty-four, you were born in 1892, weren’t you?” The applicant, seeking to get the ordeal over, would reply in the affirmative. Before she had been away from the place very long a warrant for perjury had been sworn out against her and she had Seen arrested. I found many cases equally as flagrant where Negro women had been imprisoned for such “offenses” as these.\nIn the same manner men would be intimidated and threatened. A white lawyer told me laughingly of how a Negro would approach a registration booth in his county, Orange, and ask if he could register. The officials there, in most cases of the poorer order of whites, would reply, “Oh, yes, you can register, but I want to tell you something. Some god damn black is going to get killed about this voting business yet.”\nIn Quincy, Gadsden County, the leading colored man of the town, a physician, owner of a drug store and other property including an excellent home, on election day was surrounded as he approached the polling booth to cast his ballot, by a crowd who spat in his face and dared him to wipe his face. His “crime” was that of advising colored men and women to register and vote. He has since been ordered to get out of the town but remains—determined to die rather than submit. He has always been a good citizen and highly respected by both white and colored people.\nTwo brothers of Live Oak, Suwanee County, who also were good citizens, prosperous and the owners of a large merchandise business, were called from their homes two weeks before election day, beaten almost to death and ordered to leave town immediately for the same offense of urging Negroes to vote. One has gone, the other lies at the point of death from a stroke of paralysis brought on by the beating.\nNor are these isolated cases but rather are they typical of what took place in many parts of the state. The West Palm Beach Post of October 30 carried an article with the significant statement, “Sheriff R. C. Baker will have several deputy sheriffs at the polls to arrest black violators of the election laws as fast as they appear and ask for ballots.” The inference is that only Negroes violated the election laws while it is generally known that white Democratic voters openly carried memoranda into the booths, which is directly contrary to law. Only Negro Republicans were arrested for this violation.\n\nThe Sixth Ward polling-tent, Jacksonville, Florida, colored side. Line during entire day.\nIn Jacksonville, where Negroes form slightly more than half of the population of 90,000, the situation was different. In spite of parades of the Ku Klux Klan, vicious newspaper propaganda designed to intimidate Negro voters, and the announcement two days before election that 4,000 warrants had been sworn out in blank form for the arrest of Negroes, the colored vote turned out en masse. Most of the colored people live in the second, sixth, seventh and eighth wards. An active campaign was carried on after the passage of the suffrage amendment which resulted in the registration of more colored than white women in all four of the wards. Frantic stories threatening domination by “Negro washerwomen and cooks” failed to bring out the white women to register. To the number of women was added the large registration of men, white and colored, in the spring of 1920. Yet, in the second, seventh and eighth wards the total vote did not equal the registration of colored women alone, while in the sixth ward the total number of votes cast was only a few more than the number of women, white and colored, registered. Every possible effort was made to hamper the voting of Negroes. The polling places were arranged with four entrances—one each for white women, white men, colored women and colored men. No delay was caused to white voters. More than four thousand colored men and women, whose names, addresses. and registration certificate numbers are in the hands of responsible colored citizens of Jacksonville, stood in line from 8:00 A.M., the hour of opening, to 5:40 P.M., the hour of closing the polls, and were not allowed to vote.\n\nSame polling-tent, white side. 75 in line at 12:40 P.M. There were 1569 colored women alone registered in this ward and yet only 2633 votes in all were reported.\nUnless the problem of the ballot is solved, either through reduction of Southern representation, a force bill or by some other means, and the entire problem of race relations solved through clear thinking and just dealing, our race riots and similar disturbances are just beginning. This may sound pessimistic and as though the problem were viewed only from the standpoint of an alarmist. That is not the case. It is based upon the innermost feelings and thoughts of twelve million Americans who seek to be free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Woman Voter (1921)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nHow Shall We Vote (1920)\nThe White Primary (1911)\nRemember (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nWalter F., White. 1921. “Election Day in Florida.”\nThe Crisis 21 (3): 106–9. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/21/03/election_day.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We have developed in the United States a technique of race discrimination which gains its dispicable ends by methods so subtle and evasive that the man on the street not only cannot place the blame but after a few bewildered gestures is tempted to look upon the whole thing as an “Act of God.”\nConsider, for instance, the now well-known case of Miss Augusta Savage. Miss Savage struggled up through the wretched public schools of Florida; came to New York and eventually began studying art at Cooper Union. “Miss Savage’s record,” writes the Art Director, “has been excellent and her conduct irreproachable.” The friends of Miss Savage sought to get her a chance to do some study abroad in the “Fontainebleau School of the Fine Arts”; financed by Americans and established as “a summer school for American architects, painters and sculptors.”\nThe Executive Committee of this school is impressive: The Chairman of the Department of Architecture, is Whitney Warren, a leading architect, member of the National Institute of Arts and Sciences, with an honorary degree from Harvard. The Chairman of the Department of Painting and Sculpture is Ernest C. Peixotto, a pupil of Benjamin Constant and Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor; well known as a painter and illustrator. Other members of the Committee are Edwin Blashfield, who decorated the great central dome of the Library of Congress; Howard Greenley, President of the Architectural League; Thomas Hastings, who designed the New York Public Library and is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters; J. Monroe Hewlett, President of the Mural Painters; Hermon MacNeil, President of the National Sculpture Society; and James Gamble Rogers, who designed the great Harkness Memorial Quadrangle at Yale.\nHere then, are representatives of the best America; leaders in Art and Literature; members of the world’s most exclusive clubs and organizations. This Committee told Miss Savage that she could not study at the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts and that the reason was because she was black. But do not think that this action was straightforward, clear and definite. The only clear and definite thing about it was that Miss Savage’s deposit was returned to her and that she did not go to Fontainebleau. But the responsibility for this action and the reasons for it are most difficult to trace and yet the hunt has its points of interest.\nThe Crisis has addressed a politely-worded note to each one of the eight gentlemen mentioned above. Mr. Peixotto, Mr. Warren and Mr. Greenley have not answered. However, Mr. Peixotto had already written a letter to another person which we feel at liberty to quote: He hopes she will “understand our position” and starts off with a technical excuse based on Miss Savage’s alleged failure to furnish “two letters of recommendation.” He hastens, however, to admit that this is a small matter and proceeds to say: “To be perfectly frank with you, we did learn that Miss Savage was of the colored race and the question was put before our Advisory Committee who strongly felt that in a school such as the Fontainebleau School it would not be wise to have a colored student.”\nThen come five varying points of view; first there are two alibis: Thomas Hastings says: “I believe it is needless for me to say that I personally would have no sympathy with keeping Miss Augusta Savage away from the Fontainebleau School of Arts because of Negro Descent.” Edwin Blashfield says: “I was not present at any meeting where the question of Miss Savage’s application came up or was discussed and I am entirely without knowledge of what happened.”\nJames Gamble Rogers also has an alibi handy: “I did not know anything about the case of the colored girl you mention until I read it in the newspapers.” But he adds this interesting point of view: “When we try to take advantage of this Fontainebleau School for the benefit of people here, we have to have sponsors for certain financial conditions, such as guaranteeing the payment to the boats that so many staterooms will be paid for, etc., and it is not easy to get the sponsors. Therefore, I hope that you will do nothing that will prevent us getting the sponsors.”\nHermon A. MacNeil says nothing of responsibility but is, “Extremely sorry that a story of this kind should have gotten about as I know the gentlemen of the committee are men of the broadest vision and are trying to do the very best possible. It may be that her work was not very high in quality.”\nSo far, poor Mr. Peixotto stands apparently alone; but finally, J. Monroe Hewlett adds this bit: “The accepted applicants come from all parts of the United States. It seemed clear to the committee that any race prejudice that manifested itself among the students might easily affect the entire morale of the School during its first year…. I am satisfied in my own mind that the decision reached in regard to Miss Savage was due quite as much to consideration for her as to any other thought or feeling.”\nTo us who have experience, there is nothing mystifying in all this. These men, either by shirking their plain responsibility or by disingenuous excuses have connived at a miserable piece of race discrimination; and yet every last one of them has “ducked” responsibility: they have no knowledge; they spared her feelings; they need money. Many of them prayed that the reason should be that Miss Savage had no ability, but that is disproved by the records at Cooper Union and by the fact that no very high standards of ability were required of the sensitive white Southerners. Other Directors emphasized the terrible and explosive possibilities of social contact. But the Art Director at Cooper Union writes of his own accord: “It may be added that Miss Savage’s treatment at the hands of her fellow-students, whether in the classes, in the lunch room or in their social relations generally, has been as irreproachable as has been her own conduct: indeed it appears that she has been rather a favorite.”\nIn fact, here you have in its naked shame, the technique of American race prejudice. It is idle to charge up lynching solely to the “poor white trash”; it is silly to talk of race prejudice as simply a child of ignorance and poverty. The ignorant and poor may lynch and discriminate but the real deep and the basic race hatred in the United States is a matter of the educated and distinguished leaders of white civilization. They are the ones who are determined to keep black folk from developing talent and sharing in civilization. The only thing to their credit is that they are ashamed of what they do and say and cover their tracks desperately even if ineffectually with excuses and surprises and alibis. But the discrimination goes on and they not only do not raise a hand to stop it—they even gently and politely but in strict secrecy put their shoulders to the wheel and push it forward.\nOne can only sum it up in the words of Daisy King, a white sculptor:\n\nHave you seen this latest example of ‘White Supremacy’. Sounds like good old Texas, doesn’t it? That Thomas Hastings, the architect of the 42nd Street Library, and our foremost architect since the death of Stanford White, with his own training safely completed should stoop to place a stone in the path of a little colored girl who has won a distinctive honor, against odds, is unbelievable. That Ernest Peixotto, himself a Spanish Jew, should feel it necessary to deprive a young colored woman of a well-earned scholarship in order to protect from ‘contamination’ these young Southern girls who have apparently, no honors to their credit, is, to say the least, ‘instructive’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEducation (1911)\nSegregation (1910)\nLight (1912)\nPrejudice (1911)\nGirls (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1923. “The Technique of Race Prejudice.”\nThe Crisis 26 (4): 152–54. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/26/04/technique.html."

    "text": "(From information furnished by Morris Lewis of Chicago and R. McCants Andrews of Durham, N.C.)\nNext year a new President of the United States, new members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senators are to be elected. The attitude of Negro voters is important; more Negroes will vote next year than ever before in the history of the United States. The increased migration to the North, the naturalization of foreigners and the small but steady increase by birth will probably add one quarter of a million voters to the rolls, making a total Negro vote in Northern and border states of between three-fourths and one million voters.\nThese voters are incensed against both the Republican and Democratic parties. They remember Democrats because of the treatment of black men during the War, the segregation in government departments and the continued mob violence, disfranchisement and “Jim Crow” legislation in the “rotten borough” districts of the South. They remember the absolute failure of the Republicans to redeem or seriously try to redeem their campaign pledge to pass federal legislation against lynching, or to recognize in any way the just demands of the Negro constituency.\nUnder these circumstances what will the Negro voter do? Is he intelligent enough to guide his political boat in such rough waters? There have been two chances to judge: one in a city election in Baltimore and the other in a city election in Chicago.\nIn Chicago, the black man has been counted as the secure appendage of the Republicans: In the second and third wards of Chicago, the large colored vote is registered. On the West Side, North Side, in Englewood, Woodlawn, the Hyde Park and old 380th Ward districts, there are also varied numbers of such voters from a few hundred to twenty thousand and more.\nThe principal candidates for Mayor in the recent election were Postmaster Arthur Lueder, Republican, and William E. Dever, Judge of the Superior Court, Democrat. Judge Dever was the only candidate of his party in the democratic primaries. Mr. Lueder was one of three candidates of his party in the Republican primaries. He was the choice of the Chicago Tribune, of Senator Medill McCormick and of Attorney General Brundage, an agency and individuals bearing the reputation of being lukewarm or unfriendly to the interests of the colored people. It might also be said that in the Republican primaries the colored districts supported the candidacy of Judge Barasa, who had been eminently fair in hearings before him in connection with the race riots of 1919, again demonstrating that the colored voter was doing some thinking. Aside from the election of a Mayor, a City Clerk and City Treasurer were to be elected.\nThe election returns show just how discerning was the vote of the second and third wards where so many colored people live. The second ward gave Dever, Democrat, 8,269; Lueder, Republican, 7,119. These two wards contributed over 17,487 of the 108,000 plurality for Dever. And in these two wards the Republican candidates for City Clerk and City Treasurer got more votes than the Democratic candidates for the respective offices, thus showing that the colored voter did not vote a “straight” democratic ticket.\nAside from reasons already assigned, and of more importance, was the thought on the part of black voters that the Republican party leaders should be taught a lesson before the 1924 elections; also, there was the attitude of resentment on the part of colored voters because Mayor William Hale Thompson was coerced into withdrawing from the mayoralty race; Negroes generally were not unmindful of the fair treatment accorded them by Mayor Thompson.\nAs a practical result of the election in Chicago, Major A. E. Patterson and Earl B. Dickerson, both colored lawyers, have been appointed on the staff of Assistant Corporation Counsels of the City of Chicago by the new Democratic Mayor, Hon. William E. Dever. Major Patterson says: “If Judge Dever and his political associates give the Negro a square deal, and it is generally believed that they will, there will be little reason to believe the Democratic party will not receive a fair proportion of the Negro votes in future campaigns.”\nIn Baltimore, the situation was more complicated: the Republican candidate, Broening, then Mayor, was opposed by a former Mayor Preston running as an Independent Democrat and the regular democratic nominee, Jackson. The registered Negro vote in Baltimore is over 30,000, concentrated largely in nine wards. The colored people were against Mayor Broening and issued the following card to show their reasons:\n\nWhy we are against Mayor Broening\n\nBecause—Mr. Broening permitted the Ku Klux Klan to parade the city when a Democratic Governor refused them the use of the state armories.\n\nBecause—Mr. Broening takes the credit for opening one new school (colored) which was started by a democratic councilman.\n\nBecause—Mr. Broening is endeavoring to put the proposed new Colored High School in politics; but the securing of this was the result of long years of protracted effort and the loyal support of our group to all school loans.\n\nBecause—Mr. Broening and his party leaders double-crossed the Colored Councilmen and their constituency in the famous constable fight; this, we will never forget nor forgive.\n\nBecause—Mr. Broening and his School Board have refused to equalize the Colored Teachers’ salaries for equal service.\n\nVote for Mr. Howard W. Jackson, for Mayor.\n\nOn the other hand, Preston took a stand diametrically opposed to the new colored high school on which ground was recently broken and the contract let although the building has not actually been begun. Jews and Catholics turned against Broening on account of the Ku Klux Klan incident. The dilemma before the colored voters was a difficult one. Many of them refused to vote for a Democrat under any circumstances and kept away from the Polls; those who did vote, voted very largely for Jackson. But there again the Maryland ballot is a very complicated affair, and any attempt to vote a “split” ticket usually results in the ballot being thrown out. Those Negroes, therefore, who voted for Jackson did not dare to attempt to “split” their ticket and vote also for their own two colored members of the Council. The result was, that both Broening and the two colored members were defeated and Jackson triumphed over the demagogue Preston.\nWhen we add these two incidents to the fact that in New York last year Mayor Hylan swept Negro Harlem, we have a pretty clear idea of the strategy of the Negro voter: He is going, first, to defeat his known enemies, even if that involves voting for a friendly Democrat; he is going, secondly, to vote for his friends, whether Democrats or Republicans; thirdly, he is going to refuse, unless compelled, to vote the straight ticket of any party.\nIs it not unfortunate that at this critical period in the history of the Negro voter, the Farmer-Labor party is “ducking” all the issues in which black men are primarily interested; and the Socialists are openly refusing to “fraternize” with Negroes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro in Politics (1929)\nThe Negro Voter (1928)\nVotes (1919)\nThe Election (1924)\nThe Negro Party (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1923. “Political Straws.”\nThe Crisis 26 (3): 124–26. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/26/03/political_straws.html."

The result was that he did not learn, and he saw only that blank, impervious gaze which colored people know how to assume; and that dark wall of absolute silence which they have a habit of putting up instead of applause.

It is this mighty million in whose hands the destiny of the Negroes of the Nation and the world rests.\nThey are the ones who prevent further disfranchisement; they are the ones who curb the power of the white South in Congress; they are the ones who have stopped the march of “Jim-Crow” legislation.

    "text": "She was very small and pretty and black and lived in the cabin beyond the Big Road and down the lane by the creek, where one field on field of green cotton was flowering in the spring. And one night as she sat there all alone and wistful, watching the stars, a woman passed by and hailed her. She shrank back in the shadows, but the woman smiled and said full softly:\n“Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God.”\nAnd then Mary knew, and she brought out the Old Book and read the lines aloud, following them with her little dark finger:\n“My soul doth—magnify the Lord. …”\n“For He hath regarded the low—estate of his handmaiden, for behold from—henceforth all—generations shall call me blessed…”\nEven as she read the door flew wide, and Pain stood beside her. He thrust and threw her poor little body and wracked and burst her thews in sunder. She moaned, but did not scream,—and thus at last, in years of hours, she brought forth her first—born son; and she called his name Joshua.\nDay after day she sat and watched his perfect little form. Was he not a beautiful baby? His skin was black velvet; his eyes were star—sewn midnights, set in milk; his tiny teeth, white pearls; and his hair all tender tendrils of silk.\nSometimes—some very little times—a pain caught her as she cuddled him close. Would it not be better for him if he were whiter? Brown, or yellow, or dusky cream? Then she would say fiercely: No! No! Is not Love, who is God, his Father? And would his Father send a black baby to this world just to make him suffer?\nAnd so each night after work she took him out beneath the stars, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and she heard the angels singing:\n“Glory to God in the highest and on earth Peace, good—will toward men.”\nThus did Mary, the mother, begin to dream dreams. And the child grew and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.\nNow his mother went to town every Christmas to settle for her crops, but it was not until he was twelve years old that he went with her, and saw town for the first. How marvelous and wonderful to him was the revelation.\nMary finished her work and started home, but Joshua tarried behind. When Mary found him not, she turned back seeking him. After three days she found him in a church, sitting in the midst of the deacons, both hearing them and asking them questions:\nWhy were colored folk poor?\nWhy were they afraid?\nWhose father was God?\nDid the deacons know God? Well, he did. God was his own Father.\nAnd all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.\nBut his mother said unto him:\n“Son, why did you do me this-a-way?”\nAnd he answered: “Wist ye not, that I must be about my Father’s business.”\nAnd Mary caught her breast in pain, for how may a father he mentioned\nwhen one’s father is only God? But she kept all his sayings in her heart.\nSo Joshua went back to the plantation and worked. He ploughed and\npicked cotton and hoed and drove mules and, finally, learned to be a carpenter; and always he increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man.\nBut not, alas! with all white men. Most of them mistrusted him. They\ncould not place him. He was neither sullen nor impudent. But he looked at\nthem with a certain, clear understanding and calm sense of authority; he carried himself like a man, and this they resented.\n“Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary?” they asked. “Didn’t we\nkeep him on the plantation and out of school? And yet, he’s strutting and\ntalking and preaching; he’s putting ideas into niggers’ heads.” And they\nslipped down to the old wooden church by the creek and listened to him\npreach.\nThe people were scattered on the green under the trees, eating their lunch\nout of baskets. And Joshua opened his mouth and taught them, saying:\n“Blessed are the poor; blessed are they that mourn; blessed are the meek;\nblessed are the merciful; blessed are they which are persecuted. All men are\nbrothers and God is the Father of all.”\nThen all the multitude lifted up their voices and sang: “Good news, the\nChariot’s a comin’.”\n“What kind of talk is this?” said the White Folk, “Behold, he stirreth up\nthe people.”\nWhereupon they took counsel together. They stopped his preaching and\ndoubled his work. They cursed and drove his hearers; they warned and beat\nthem.\nMary watched all this in mounting terror. She saw the hurt in Joshua’s\neyes and the bitterness in his heart. She knew that he suffered, not simply in\nhimself, but with every other sufferer. That he was wounded by every sin and\nbruised by every injustice. He was oppressed and he was afflicted, yet he\nopened not his mouth. She saw him walk daily, despised and rejected of men,\na man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. The world hid its face from him\nand esteemed him not.\nBitter, ever more bitter, grew the White Folk at his silent protest—his\nhumble submission to wrong.

They are cloaking their indefensible tyranny by assertions that a new and wild radicalism among Negroes is creating a danger of race conflict. Some Negro journals are already hastening to cover, by asserting their loyalty and disowning the new radicals. This is dangerous business. The Crisis holds no brief for the: Messenger, the Negro World, and other periodicals, but they have a right to speak.\nThe Crisis does not believe in violence as a method of social reform—it does not believe in Revolution, but it does believe in free speech and freedom to think, and it is the duty of every Negro to see that the right of black men to think and write and criticize shall not be abridged and taken away under the guise of curbing revolution.\nVardaman’s Weekly, Jim Jam Jems, The Anderson, S. C., Tribune, the Jackson, Miss., Clarion, the Texas Harpoon, and a score of other dirty Southern sheets have been pouring their filth and lies against Negroes into the mails for ten, twenty, and thirty years, and not a whisper of protest has come from the United States Government, from the States, from the white Church, or from any noticeable number of decent white men. But when, now, there arises, as it is perfectly natural there should arise, a shrill and bitter attack on race prejudice by young Negroes—a new demand for new freedom, and even a tendency to join with extremists of all colors in a struggle for liberty. whom have we to thank but the lawless bourbon South?

My father was an abolitionist, and I had a black mammy⸺”\nMr. Brownson looked out of the window, and said rapidly:\n“I have come to ask for certain rights and privileges. My people⸺”\n“⸺”suffer; I know it; I know it. I have often remarked what a shame it was. Sir, it is an outrage!”\n“⸺ yes; we want to ask⸺”\nMr. Paleface raised a deprecating finger, ’Not social equality,” he murmured,—“I trust you are not asking that.”\n“Certainly not,” said Brownson. “I think the right of a man to select his friends and guests and decide with whom he will commit matrimony, is sacredly his and his alone.”\n“Good—good! Now, my man, we can talk openly, face to face. We can pour out our souls to each other. What can I do? I have already sent my annual check to Hampton.”\n“Sir, we want to vote.”\n“Ah! That is difficult—difficult. You see, voting has come to have a new significance. We used to confine our votes to politics, but now—bless me!—we are voting religion, work, social-reform, landscape-gardening, and art. Then, too, women are in politics —you see—well, I’m sure you sense the difficulties. Moreover, what is voting? A mere form—the making and execution of the laws is the thing, and there I promise you that I⸺”\n“Well, then; we would help in carrying out the laws.”\n“Commendable ambition. Very, very commendable. But this involves even greater difficulties. Administrators and executives are thrown closely together—often in the same room— at the same desk. They have to mingle and consult. Much as I deplore the fact, it is true, that a man will not sit at a desk or work at a bench with a man whose company at a theatre he would resent.”\n“T see,” said Brownson, thoughtfully. “I presume, then, it is our business to demand this right to sit in theatres and places of popular entertainment.”\n“Good Lord, man, that’s impossible! Civil rights like this cannot be forced. Objectionable persons must grow, develop—er wash, before⸺”\n“Then I am sure you will help me clean and train my people. I want to join in the great movements for social uplift.”\n“Splendid! I will have some movements organized for your folks.”\n“No, I want to be part of the general movement, so as to get the training and inspiration, the wide outlook—the best plans.”\n“Are you crazy? Don’t you know that social uplift work consists of a series of luncheons, dinners, and teas, with ladies present?”\n“Um,” said Brownson. “I see. I, also, see that in answering your first question, I made a mistake. In the light of your subsequent definition, I see that social equality, far from being what I don’t want, is precisely what I do want.”\n“I knew it!’ screamed Mr. Paleface.”I knew it all the time; I saw it sneaking into your eyes.

No healthy, decent man,—white, black, red, or blue—could for a moment admit so monstrous a fact.\nHe could, naturally, say: I do not WANT to marry this woman of another race, and this is what 999 black men out of every thousand DO say.

The New England of my birth and day was English in its soul: its speech was more English than American; its history was an extension of English history; its law was English tradition; its town government was of English ancestry. Our reverence for England was increased rather than diminished by distance and lack of actual contact and also, I regret to remember, by the then current dislike of the Irish.\nSince those days I have visited England four times and met and known many Englishmen. With all the world, I have admired the Englishman of birth and breeding and felt the strange might and attraction of Empire on which the sun never sets.\nBut—and that “but” did not come from the coldness of the English manner, for I had been prepared for that by our own New England unemotional standards—but I remember once in Glasgow, seeing a young, beautiful woman lying in the gutter and a policeman kicking her. For a moment, I felt like murder. She was just a drunken prostitute, but——\nOf course, Glasgow is not England and the East End is not London; but from that day a certain doubt of England found a place in my consciousness. Then I was in Paris at the time of the Peace Conference. There was no doubt but what England was getting more out of the Peace than anyone else and the reason was clear: She had better trained statesmen and they knew what they wanted and got it. But there was in their methods a sort of calm, grim power that I feared.\nI have always looked on England as the best administrator of colored peoples and laid her success to her system of Justice. But here, again, I am beginning to waver. I have talked to Indians, to Egyptians, to West and South Africans, and they have left a great, dull doubt in my mind—a feeling of world apprehension.\nFinally, there comes to me from English sources this terrible tale of theft, murder, and outrage done by Englishmen to Negroes, unrebuked by English government and unprotested for a generation.\nEnglish missionaries long ago entered the land of the Matabele and Mashona peoples, in the Zambese basin. An English company in 1889 was allowed to enter, on the express condition that it regard native law and land rights. Yet today 800,000 Negroes of this country, now called Rhodesia, have absolutely no title to 90 million acres of their own land! As Englishmen themselves write: “The land rights of the natives have been appropriated simply: by fraud and theft—that is the beginning and end of the whole sordid story.”\nIf we turn from Africa to Asia, what do we see? The World Tomorrow tells us:\n\nIndia contains some 300,000,000 people. The average per capita income is $10 per annum. On the basis of prices at the end of 1916, rice sufficient for one meal a day would cost $10.95 per annum. Taxes on the basis of the new budget average about $1.40 per capita. Is it any wonder that large sections of the population are living under famine conditions, that between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 of these undernourished people died of influenza, and that 75,000,000 are receiving barely one square meal in two days? This starving people contributes to Imperial Britain in drain of one sort or another for the benefits of administration and interest on capital an amount estimated at from $100,000,000 to $200,000,000. Her new budget calls for the expenditure of more than $200,000,000 on the military—about 48 per cent. of the total budget.\n\nNeed we add Ireland, Egypt, West Africa, and the West Indies to this tale? No. \nEngland has sinned against dependent and backward people to an unbelievable extent. Tory England sinned, Liberal England sinned, and Labor England may easily continue the story.\nThere are but two paths out: Ireland, India, and Egypt must become independent, self-governing states. Home rule must be granted to the West Indians and civilized West Africa. The natives of South Africa must be delivered from the Union of South Africa. Either this, or the world must gird itself anew to meet a tyranny which looms as portentous as the God-defying dreams of Germany and which portends even greater bitterness, because it involves the up-striving and embittered darker races of the whole earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEngland, Again (1920)\nA Mild Suggestion (1912)\nWest Indian Immigration (1924)\nRefinement and Love (1916)\nLondon (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “England.” The Crisis 19\n(3): 107–8. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/19/03/england.html."

    "text": "Again and again when men unite to some great end and accomplish all or a part of that toward which they aim, there arises an astonishing and often disreputable scramble for the honor and credit of the accomplishment. In a sense this is natural. Independent enthusiasts striving for a great end often forget or are ignorant of others striving for the same end and are indignant or incredulous when they do not receive what they think is due credit. Something of this unfortunate feeling is creeping into recent movements in which this Association has been interested. An extraordinary campaign has been carried on to prevent Congress from passing discriminatory legislation. That the Sixty-Third Congress has actually adjourned without the enactment of such laws, and with some things like the Howard University appropriation to its credit, is an extraordinary tribute to the organized fighting strength of American Negroes. To whom should the credit for this accomplishment be given? Manifestly to no one person or to no one organization. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People would be the last to claim sole and entire credit for the accomplishment. Individuals unconnected with it and organizations not affiliated have from time to time joined enthusiastically in these campaigns. Two things the Association has an undoubted right to claim; first:—that through its widespread organization and continual vigilance it has been able to keep the colored people warned, and secondly, that through its continual insistence upon the value of agitation it has brought almost a revolution in the attitude of the colored people during the last five years. But after all what difference does it make as to who did the deed so long as the deed is done? so long as the Negroes fight aggression, advance their interests and rescue the spirit of democracy in the United States?

    "text": "AN AMAZING ISLAND\nJamaica is a most amazing island. I have seen something of the earth, more especially Europe and America which leave, to be sure, much of the lands that I have unseen; but looked upon hitherto Jamaica is the most startling. The ride from Spanishtown to the northwestern sea is one of the great rides of the world to be likened to the Horse Shoe Bend or St. Gotthard. The Wag Water is a beautiful stream and Montego Bay is the bay of Naples. The whole island is a mass of gray, green mountains thrown on the face of the sea with gash and shadow and veil. The rain of Jamaica is the maddest, wildest and wettest of rains and the sunshine is God’s. There in Jamaica the world is met. Africa and Asia and Europe all meet which may mean little and yet may be the most fateful meeting the world ever saw. In Jamaica for the first time in my life I lived beyond the color line—not on one side of it but beyond its end. There in strange places I could sense its curious paths stopping and wavering and fading into uncertain threads. Of course, I was ever looking for it. That is my inborn nature. I saw that the moving picture films, for instance, were “approved” by “His Worship, the Mayor,” and when I sat beside His Worship, the Mayor at dinner, behold, His Worship was colored. I almost hesitated at the barber shops but the barbers did not hesitate. It was a strange sort of luxury to ride on railways where engineers, firemen, conductor and brakemen were black. The smart, dark Constables in their gleaming white hats and coats gave me a double sense of security. In the stores there was usually a curl or a tint in the clerk that proclaimed the most ancient of blood and it was the same in the post office, the telephone exchange and the government buildings. In fact, though somewhat of an expert in knowing mine own, I confess that in Jamaica it was quite impossible for me to pick out the alleged 15,000 white people out of the 900,000 of population.\nThe peasants—a great mass of hard working black laborers—were to me perhaps more alluring. I can see now those black, straight and strong and full-bosomed forms, supple of hip and thigh and lithe of limb, sinewy yet fine and calm, treading their silent miles like fate. Soft of word and slow but sweet of smile and uncomplaining, of the blood and tears of such as these was built Jamaica. Threaded through all this curious beauty, with palm and mahogany, the scent of orange blossoms and the gleam of bananas, threaded through all this is the tragedy of a poverty almost incomprehensible. Think of a woman carrying sand all day, twelve endless hours in a Jamaica sun, for eighteen cents! Think of able-bodied men working for twenty-five cents and less a day. Think of walking fifty miles and carrying a hundred pound burden for forty cents. Think of raising and selling oranges at two cents a hundred!\nHere is an island rich beyond dream; out of it for three centuries and more the white world has reaped its millions. Yet today the island lies poverty-stricken but facing the world proudly with one great gift, the gift of racial peace, the utter overturning of the barbaric war of color, with a chance for men to lift themselves regardless of the complexion of their grandfathers. It is the most marvelous paradox of this paradoxical western world.\n\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “An Amazing Island.” The Crisis. 10(2):80–81.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSketches from Abroad (1924)\nI Go A-Talking (1913)\nThe Princess of the Hither Isles (1913)\nEaster-Emancipation 1863-1913 (1913)\nThe Story of Africa (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “An Amazing Island.”\nThe Crisis 10 (2): 80–81. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/10/02/amazing_island.html."

    "text": "The white southern oligarchy is laughing silently behind its hand. Two decades’ years ago it faced a dilemma. A wretched Negro public school system (which has since grown worse in most southern states) made it easy to disfranchise the mass of the Negro voters by a literacy test. But how about the 100,000 southern white voters who could not read and write? To cajole these the oligarchy, with a smile, concocted the celebrated “Grandfather clause,” impudently establishing hereditary privilege in this republic. They did not expect the scheme to work. It was a “gold brick” pure and simple for inducing the ignorant white laborer to destroy the black labor vote and leave himself so much the more at the mercy of the capitalist. To the amazement of the white South itself this illegal, undemocratic and outrageous provision has actually been allowed to stand on the statute books and be enforced for SEVENTEEN YEARS!\nFinally, when further evasion of the issues involved was humanly almost impossible, the Supreme Court solemnly declares a law unconstitutional which has already been in force a half a generation.\nConsidering, however, the inexcusable blows delivered on the body of the prostrate black man by the Supreme Court from the Dred Scott case, of infamous memory, to the emasculating of the Fourteenth Amendment, the civil rights cases and the “Jim-Crow” decisions of our day, we have cause to rejoice at the overthrow of the “Grandfather Clause.”\nBut there is much more than this in the late decision and the Bourbon South would do well to laugh neither loud nor too long. The Supreme Court has confirmed the validity of the Fifteenth Amendment. It has declared that Negroes have a right to vote on the same terms as other citizens. This is a blow at all race discrimination in politics. This will not give us our rights immediately but it puts us in the shadow of the mightiest advance since 1863.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSupreme Court (1914)\nThe Newest South (1913)\nSuffrage (1920)\nVotes (1919)\nEducation (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “The Grandfather Clause.”\nThe Crisis 10 (5): 231–32. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/10/05/grandfather_clause.html."

    "text": "St. Mark M.E. Church\n\n\nIt is a difficult task to single out for mention some of the colored people in Chicago who have made a mark in the world. First and foremost our limited space makes it quite impossible to mention more than a few and those whom we select are selected rather as examples than as an exhaustive list.\nOur cover carries the picture of Franklin A. Denison, Colonel of the Eighth Infantry, Illinois National Guard. Colonel Denison is a graduate of Lincoln and of the Union College of Law. He was for many years Assistant Prosecuting Attorney of the City of Chicago and afterward Assistant Corporation Counsel.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuinn Chapel (A.M.E.)\n\n\nSt. Thomas (P.E.)\n\n\nOlivet (Baptist)\n\n\n\n\nThe Eighth Regiment, of which he was elected colonel in 1914, was first mustered in as a battalion in 1895. In 1898 it was raised to regimental strength and saw service in the Spanish war under Colonel Marshall who must be regarded as its founder and chief inspiration. In 1908 a movement was started to provide an armory and permanent home for the regiment. After a long and weary struggle in which Colonel Denison took a prominent part the armory was finally ready for occupancy in February, 1915. It is constructed of fire brick with stone trimmings and has a drill floor one hundred and sixty feet by ninety, beside corridors, executive offices and company rooms, thirty-eight by twenty-eight feet.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. C.E. Bentley\n\n\nMr. Oscar De Priest\n\n\nDr. Daniel Williams\n\n\n\n\nThe best known colored American in Chicago outside of mere racial lines is undoubtedly Charles E. Bentley. Dr. Bentley is a dentist. He was born in Ohio, educated in the public schools of Cincinnati and received his dental training at the Chicago College of Dental Surgery. He early became so proficient in his work as to number many of the most prominent citizens of Chicago among his patients and to draw others from outside the city.\nBut Dr. Bentley has been more than a mere dentist. In 1896 at a meeting of the Illinois Dental Society, Dr. Bentley made the first suggestion of dental examinations in the public schools. Afterward he submitted a comprehensive report on the matter to the Odontographic Society and from this have sprung the dental examinations made in nearly all the public schools of the country. The above society was organized by Dr. Bentley in 1888 and he was its first president. Under his management it held in 1903 a great dental congress with three thousand members of the profession and a thousand dental students in attendance. As a reward for this Dr. Bentley was made head of the dental clinics at the St. Louis Exposition but resigned on account of the prejudice of southern whites.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. W.F. Childs\n\n\nMr. Joseph Miller\n\n\nRev. M.H. Jackson\n\n\n\n\nOf late years Dr. Bentley has been prominent in civic work: for twenty years he has been the secretary of the Provident Hospital and is one of the Directors of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\n\n\nThe Overton Hygienic Manufactoring Company\n\n\nSheadrick B. Turner is one of the two colored men elected to the Illinois Legislature from Chicago and is one of the three representatives from the First Senatorial District. He follows a number of colored men from this district, among them Edward H. Morris, William Martin, John Jones, Dr. Lane and Edward D. Green. In 1912 the split of the Republican Party resulted in the loss of a colored representative from this district, so that Mr. Turner takes up race representation where Mr. Green left off.\nMr. Turner was born in Bayou, Louisiana, July 12, 1869. Finishing the public schools in 1878 he moved to Kane County, Illinois, where he was graduated from the high school. Moving to Springfield he took a course in the Springfield Business College. In June, 1908, he was graduated from the Illinois College of Law.\n\n\n\nProvident Hospital and Vicinity\n\n\nThe most noted colored physician in the United States is Daniel Hale Williams who was born in Pennsylvania in 1888. Dr. Williams is a graduate of the Northwestern Medical School, has long practiced in Chicago and while a member of the Illinois State Board of Health became one of the principal promoters and founders of Provident Hospital in 1891. This hospital established the first training school for colored nurses. Dr. Williams remained as attending surgeon in this hospital until 1912. For several years he was surgeon-in-chief of Freedmen’s Hospital, Washington, D.C., and is now connected with Meharry Medical College and St. Luke’s Hospital, Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n\nMrs. I.W. Barnett\n\n\nMrs. L.B. Shrevesr\n\n\nMiss V.M. Anderson\n\n\n\n\nDr. Williams is famous as the first physician to perform a successful operation on the human heart. He was made a fellow of the American College of Surgeons in 1913 and received the degree of LL.D. from Wilberforce University.\nMr. Oscar DePriest is the first colored man to be elected a member of the Chicago Common Council. He was born in Alabama, and is forty-three years of age with a wife and two sons. He was originally a painter but is now engaged in the real estate business and has long been prominent in politics.\n\n_\n\n\n\nMr. E.H. Wright\n\n\nRev. J.W. Robinson\n\n\nDr. G.C. Hall\n\n\n\n\nMr. Edward H. Wright has also held high office having been County Commissioner and has just been appointed Assistant Corporation Counsel at a salary of five thousand dollars by the Mayor of Chicago.\nAnother prominent Chicago physician is Dr. George Cleveland Hall. He has been for twenty years attending surgeon of the Provident Hospital and has given much of his time lately to the holding of surgical clinics and the establishment of infirmaries throughout the large cities of the South.\n\n\n\nWhere the Exposition will be held\n\n\nDr. Hall is a prominent member of many movements for uplift including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Negro Business League, ihe Frederick Douglas Center and the Wabash Avenue Department of the Young Men’s Christian Association.\nAmong the prominent ministers of Chicago may be mentioned the Rev. A.J. Carey, who has recently been appointed Special Investigator of the Corporation Counsel by Mayor Thompson. Dr. Carey was pastor of Quinn Chapel.\nThe Rev. H.M. Jackson has been for twenty-five years pastor of the First Colored Presbyterian Church of the city. He is especially honored for his upright character.\n\n\n\n\nOne of Dr. Bentley’s offices\n\n\nThe Rev. J.B. Massiah of the Protestant Episcopal Church has been in Chicago for more than ten years and in that time has quadrupled his congregation.\nAmong other clergymen are the Rev. John W. Robinson, the Rev. E.J. Fisher and a number of pastors whose biographies we have been unable to obtain. We learn of Dr. Fisher’s death as we go to press.\nMr. William F. Childs, Lieutenant of Police, has already been spoken of in The Crisis. He has had a distinguished career and is in the Bureau of Identification.\nAmong the business men Mr. Anthony Overton, the head of the Overton Hygienic Manufacturing Company, is one of the most interesting. His company was established at Kansas City, Missouri, in 1898 to manufacture baking powder with a capital of $1,960 and two employees. The company now is capitalized at $286,000, manufactures sixty-two different kinds of articles including baking powder, extracts and toilet articles and employs thirty-two people.\n\n\n\nThe Hon. S.B. Turner\n\n\nAmong the other successful Negro business men of Chicago is Joseph Miller, the owner and proprietor of Miller’s Buena Park Warehouse and Baggage Express\nMr. Miller began life forty-nine years ago and ultimately started a small express business with one horse and a wagon. To-day his fireproof warehouse, with heated rooms and vaults, occupies fifty feet frontage in the busiest district of the North Shore of Chicago. He has three large vans and five express wagons to which an auto truck has recently been added.\nTurning now to the women of Chicago we face especial difficulty in selection because of their natural desire to avoid publicity. We may merely mention Mrs. Florence Lewis Bentley, who was for several years literary editor of the Philadelphia Press and is to-day a strong social force in the city.\n\n\n\nMr. Binga’s Bank\n\n\nBest known to the world is the late Amanda Smith who was born in Maryland and freed by her father together with her mother and six other children. Amanda Smith went to England at the invitation of Lady Somerset and spent twelve years preaching in Europe, Asia and Africa. She gave every cent of the savings thus accumulated to the founding of a home for orphan children. She lived just long enough to see this home for which she had sacrificed everything assured permanence by being placed under State control. She died in Florida in 1915 at the age of seventy-eight.\nMrs. Ida Wells Barnett is one of the best known colored women in America and a peculiarly gifted speaker. As a young woman and editor of a paper in Tennessee she witnessed the lynching of three respectable and entirely innocent colored men. Aroused by this frightful injustice she started a crusade, and not before nor since has the world been so aroused over the disgrace of American mob murders.\nMiss Wells married F.L. Barnett, a prominent colored lawyer of Chicago, and has reared a family.\nWe may also mention Mrs. Lulu B. Shreves, President of the only colored auxiliary of the Spanish war veterans in the State of Illinois, and Miss Violet M. Anderson, a law reporter, who numbers nearly all the colored lawyers and many of the noted white lawyers among her patrons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSoldiers (1920)\nA Soldier (1920)\nColored Chicago (1915)\nThe American Legion (1919)\nOfficers (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBois, W.E.B., Du. 1915. “Some Chicagoans of Note.” The\nCrisis 10 (5): 237–42. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/10/05/some_chicagoans_of_note.html."

    "text": "The Eighth Regiment Armory\n\n\nIt is said that the first cabin in the present confines of Chicago was built by a San Domingan Negro in 1779. To-day there are 50,000 persons of Negro descent in this city of two and one-half millions.\nChicago has usually treated its colored citizens more liberally than most large American cities. The Ordinance of 1787 drove slavery from this territory and fugitive slaves found refuge here in many cases. It was not until 1873, however, that colored children were admitted to the public schools.\nLike all the larger American cities Chicago’s Negro population has an immigrant character and consequently is at any given period rather sharply divided in an older class of well established citizens and a large mass of more or less unassimilated new comers. In the case of white immigrants the first of these two classes merge with the larger community and cease to figure as “hyphenated” Americans. Color prejudice in the case of persons of Negro descent class all these citizens in one group, visit criticism and discrimination upon them all alike and makes intelligent study or judgment of them extremely difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor O.B. Duncan\n\n\nMajor R.R. Jackson\n\n\nMajor A.A. Wesley\n\n\n\n\nEarning a living is naturally the first problem of these 50,000 folks. In 1910 out of 18,437 colored men over fifteen years of age in gainful occupations there were 2,500 general laborers, 3,828 railway porters, 3,136 servants and waiters, 1,358 janitors, 443 bartenders and elevator men and 1,841 artisans including 319 barbers, 119 butchers, 92 carpenters, 67 stationery engineers, 116 stationery firemen, 95 machinists, 246 helpers in building and hand trades, 198 painters, 90 plasterers, 67 masons, 46 electricians, etc.\n\n\n\nCaptains of the Regiment\n\n\n\n1. Hill\n\n\n2. Pinkney\n\n\n3. White\n\n\n4. Fry\n\n\n5. Arnett\n\n\n6. Jefferson\n\n\n7. Stokes\n\n\n8. Anderson\n\n\n9. Nelson\n\n\n10. Holmes\n\n\n11 Byrd\n\n\n12. Smith\n\n\n\n\nAmong the other 8,000 men there were in transportation 220 chauffeurs, 566 draymen, 149 longshoremen, 266 deliverymen, 535 porters in stores and 131 messenger boys.\nIn professional service there were 619: 78 actors, 15 artists, 76 clergymen, 14 dentists, 10 editors and reporters, 44 lawyers, 216 musicians, 16 photographers, 109 physicians, 30 showmen and 11 school teachers.\nIn business there were 93 manufacturers, 24 proprietors of transfer companies, 5 wholesale dealers, 23 undertakers, 218 retail dealers and 771 clerks, salesmen, stenographers, etc.\n\n\n\nLt. Col. James A. Johnson\n\n\nIn the civil service there were 54 policemen and detectives which have since increased to over 80. There were 20 United States, state and city officials and 87 watchmen and firemen.\nColored women in Chicago were in gainful occupations in 1910 as follows: 3,653 as servants and waitresses, 2,229 as washerwomen, 939 as dressmakers and milliners, 316 as hairdressers and manicurists, 458 as boarding housekeepers, stewardesses, etc. Beside these there were 29 women retail dealers, 54 actresses, 136 musicians, 53 school teachers, 42 trained nurses, 53 stenographers and 145 clerks, book-keepers, etc. A later compilation in 1913 shows 292 colored men employed bv the City of Chicago and 755 by the Federal Government including a large number of post office clerks and carriers.\n\n\n\nThe Miller Warehouse\n\n\nColored Chicago suffers from high rent and difficulty in buying houses in good residence districts. The increase, however, in home owning during the last twenty years has been phenomenal although no exact statistics are available. There are thirty or more colored churches in the city, a fine hospital, the Provident, four social settlements working chiefly among colored people and the Young Men’s Christian Association with a building which cost $195,000 and a membership of 2,000. There is an Old Folks’ Home, a Home for Colored Working Girls, a League of Colored Women’s Clubs, the Amanda Smith Industrial Home and a large number of social clubs like the Appomatox. Out of the mass of colored folk in Chicago have risen numbers of distinguished people who have made their mark in city life and even in the life of the nation quite independent of their race or color. As compared with other cities colored Chicago is noted for its push and independence, its political aggressiveness and its large number of middle class working people who are doing well.

In business and industry they are still behind but pushing rapidly forward.

    "text": "The Frank case only offers illustration of the truth that in the South all things may be brought about by an appeal to prejudice. This case differs from similar cases principally in that the victim was a Jew instead of a Negro and that a governor had courage enough at the last to resist the popular clamor for his blood and base his decision on the evidence in the case. The case also illustrates strikingly the inadequacy of our legal machinery in solving questions of justice. Frank escaped a legal lynching by the narrowest possible margin. His sentence was commuted by Governor Slaton only a few hours before the time appointed for his death. His appeal had been carried to the Supreme Court of the United States. The majority of the body like that of the State Supreme Court based its adverse decision entirely on points of law. It practically said that Frank had had a fair trial in law, if not in fact.\nIt is also difficult, it seems, for Boards of Pardon and Governors to deal with an “atmosphere”—say such an atmosphere as that of Atlanta, during the hours in which Frank’s life hung in the balance. Perhaps that is the real reason for the logical decision that a man of whose guilt there is too grave a doubt to hang him, may still be found guilty with enough certainty to spend his life in a Georgia convict camp. At all events it is very like the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSupreme Court (1914)\nDeception (1916)\nBrandeis (1916)\nThe Old Story (1911)\nJustice (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “Frank.” The Crisis 10 (4):\n177. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/10/04/frank.html."

It is the duty of all men to work and this work usually renders a service to the community for which the community is willing to pay with services and materials in return. Sometimes, to be sure, the community does not recognize the value of valuable work; sometimes it pays ridiculous pittances for work of the very highest value and unfitted thereby from continuing his education at any recognized modern in-on the other hand it again and again pays extortionate returns for services that are negligible or even absolute disservice. Nevertheless the average man must be trained for work which the average community will reward with a living wage. In these days of intricate technique such training cannot be acquired by chance or as a side issue or as an after thought. It must form an integral part of every person’s education. “Therefore,” says the principal of the school with the largest Negro attendance in Harlem, “I am going to train these Negroes as cooks and gardeners.”"

Is there any justice in making a particular body of men the drudges of society, destined for the worst work under the worst conditions and at the lowest pay, simply because a majority of their fellow men for more or less indefinite and superficial reasons do not like them? Manifestly life, and abundant life, is the object of industry and we teach men to earn a living in order that their industry may administer to their own lives and the lives of their fellows. If, therefore, any human being has large ability it is not only for his advantage but for the advantage of all society that he be put to the work that he can do best. To assume that ability is to be measured by so-called racial characteristics—by color, by hair or by stature is not only ridiculous but dangerous. To-day we can afford to look carefully day are for men and not men for machines, while on the other hand because of the mechanical and industrial age through which we have passed there is grave lack of deep intelligence and character. While then we teach men to earn a living, that teaching is incidental and subordinate to the larger training of intelligence in human beings and to the largest development of self-realization in men. Those who would deny this to the Negro race are enemies of mankind."

    "section": "The Result",
    "text": "The Result\nThe result of limiting the education of Negroes under the mask of fitting them for work is the slow strangulation of the Negro college. Howard to-day is dependent upon the precarious support of the majority in Congress; Fisk has an endowment which looks ridiculous beside that of Hampton and Tuskegee. Atlanta has almost no endowment. None of the five major Negro colleges have today any solid financial prospect for growth and development. Not only that but they are regularly sneered at by men who dare not raise their arguments above a sneer. We hear again and again repeated the usual lie that these colleges are persisting in the curriculum of fifty years ago. As a matter of fact practically all of these colleges are conforming to the standard of education as laid down by the highest authorities in this country. What they are really asked to do is to adopt a course of study which does not conform to modern standards, which no modern system of education will recognize and which condemns the student who takes it to end his education in a blind alley. It is the unforgivable sin of some of the greatest so-called industrial schools that the boy who is induced to take their course is absolutely unfitted thereby from continuing his education at a recognized modern institution. This is a crime against childhood for which any nation ought to be ashamed.\nWho are the men who are planning the new Negro curriculum? Are they educational experts learned in the theory and practise of training youth? No, most of them never taught a child or held any responsible place in a school system or gave the subject any serious study. Are they friends of the Negro desiring his best interests and development? No, they are friends of the white South and stand openly committed to any demand of the white South.\nThe latest attack on Negro education comes from Philadelphia. Very adroitly and cunningly the Negroes have been massed in segregated schools. Now “industrial training” is to be introduced in the Negro schools and a representative of a leading southern industrial school is on hand to advise!\nDo Negroes oppose this because they are ashamed of having their children trained to work? Certainly not. But they know that if their children are compelled to cook and sew when they ought to be learning to read, write and cipher, they will not be able to enter the high school or go to college as the white children are doing. It is a deliberate despicable attempt to throttle the Negro child before he knows enough to protest."

    "text": "The Excuse\nEven in industrial training the white authorities are persistently dishonest. They will not train our children in good paying trades and respectable vocations. They want them to be servants and menials. The excuse which is continually brought forward, particularly in the North, is that there is “no opening” for them in the higher ranges of the industrial world! For this reason opportunities even for the best industrial training are persistently denied colored students. Trade schools in many of the large cities have the habit of forcing colored students who apply into the courses for domestic service or sewing on the plea that millinery, carpentry and various lines of mechanical work offer no opportunity for colored folk. Surely this reduces the argument for industrial training to rank absurdity and the cause of real, honest industrial training deserves more sensible treatment than this."

We loved Justice and Freedom; we sought reform and uplift in politics, health protection; a nobler and less class distinction race hatred; art, we hoped for universal education; but our country? We scarcely had a country—we willed a whole world. And yet, beneath all this, logically we did love our country because we deemed it capable of realizing our dreams and inspiring the greater world. Else one would no longer have dreamed or worked here. We would have sought a Land of Promise. But did American Socialists emigrate to Germany? No, German Socialists came to America, and worked and believed that here the injustices of private wealth could best and most quickly be remedied. But again Reactionists found here no Utopia but at least a sanctuary and though which they could not find in Russia, Mexico, or the West Indies, or for Did Negroes leave America because Africa? No, they became insulted at the mere suggestion. Despite horror-stories, they believed it eventually possible to realize here in America all their highest hopes and aspirations. So with every man who has toiled in this land for higher and better things—even those who longed for the Peace of God, which in these heavy days passed understanding—not all loved but what passionately not America, and loved America might be the Real America, as we sometimes said.\nMen work and fight and sweat for a dream only because they believe it possible. Are the dreams of America less possible now that we fight for common decency in international affairs than before when we strove for highest things within the nation? If leaving the arena of the heart and intellect, we are forced to contend like very beasts, is the fighting any less necessary? Rather is the call of duty infinitely higher when with gun and knife and clenched hand, we are compelled to strive not simply for the higher life, but for life itself.

The Girl took him in and plead for him—fed him when she thought of it and overfed him after she forgot. He was wild with the joy of a home and bounded in shooting leaps across the meadows. The Woman, who was wiser than we and knew that dogs are more than human, looked on him coldly at first, for she had loved dogs before, and love is a terrible thing. Once he was lost and I and the Girl sought him as the sun died in the west, sought him east and west and north—calling and whistling—till at last he came darting like an arrow out of the unknown dark to leap and fawn upon us and bark triumphantly. Once he was stolen, but after two nights he crept back to us, dirty and bedraggled, with the accusing rope tied around him. Ah! but we were glad, and to celebrate we bought a collar and set his name brightly upon it.\nThen of a certain Sunday morning catastrophe threatened us—two Russians stood without the gate and said, “It is our dog,” and “Larrabee!” they called and he went, wagging his tail. But the Woman came quietly to the door and said, “Steve!” and he leapt back in joy and wriggled on her and kissed her. Then there was parleying and tales of his beautiful wolf-hound mother and—“But will you take him?” asked the Woman, her voice soft with fear. The Russian wife patted him tenderly and said, “No, we go back to Russia, now that Revolution has brought Freedom, and leave him with you, for he loves you and you are kind.” So then the Girl left her hiding and her tears and clasped her treasure, and the Russians went back—Great God! to what?\nAnd the dog waxed strong and mighty, golden and beautiful. Men feared his very sight, and his seldom bark was a forest of sound; but he loved the Woman with an endless love—following her every footstep, harkening to her every word, guarding her every movement. The Girl he liked next; and me he tolerated good-naturedly. To our guests he was studiously polite, with the grave courtesy of the greatly born; to all children he was humble servant—but the Woman was God!\nThen came the end. After two years of delights, after the wonder of a new home, after a summer by the sounding sea and winters in snows; after great dreamful naps and terrifying forays; after evenings of strange, weird music—after all this came slow steps and pain and the great frightened look of love in his eyes grew more and more wistful as he followed the Woman whither his palsied legs could not go. So they came and took him away and gave him strange medicine to eat, but the light died in his eyes and in mercy they put him to sleep. The Woman wept.\nHe is gone. Last night, meseems, he slept beside the werwolves who guard the angels of the throne of God. At dawn I saw his soul flashing in golden flame across the northern skies; and now at noon behold him, leaping with mighty bounds across the broad steppes of his fathers. I hear his great voice sounding above the chaos of the beautifullest dream of two centuries, when the Christ of the Bolsheviki cried in God-begotten faith to the boiling, angry, fear-mad waters, “Peace!” and there was no peace. I feel his golden fleece bristling with almighty curses and his fangs dripping blood above the Huns who would destroy, not alone the flesh, but the spirit of a great people. On, Steve, on! rend and tear and kill and die that the sweet, good earth may live again and that Russia may not die.\nAll this I see (for I am Seer), but in our deserted home the Girl is silent and the Woman weeps, while I? Oh, I, always, beneath the hand of fate, write—and write—and write.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Gospel According to Mary Brown (1919)\nCurtains of Pain (1917)\nFor What (1919)\nUnrest (1920)\nOf the Children of Peace (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “Steve.” The Crisis 17 (2):\n62–63. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/17/02/steve.html."

    "text": "As announced in the December, 1918, Crisis the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has undertaken to see that a scientific and exhaustive history of the black man in the Great War is written. The Association wishes to duplicate no work that others may do and it is especially anxious to co-operate to the fullest extent with all persons who know the facts and are acquainted with historical methods. Already the list of those co-operating with us is of considerable size and first importance.\nPreliminary to this work and with the idea of at once getting material and a point of view, I came to France. Quite by accident my trip was made on the same boat taken by Dr. R.R. Moton, of Tuskegee, who was going on a special trip arranged by Secretary of War Baker. Wherever possible Dr. Moton and I have gladly co-operated but our missions were distinct in every respect.\nAfter a rapid survey of the situation here I am venturing to send back a preliminary and tentative foreword to the history I hope to write. It is nothing more than a sketch—its details are lacking and some basic facts missing, but I think I have the main outlines.\nThe black soldier saved civilization in 1914-18. First, nearly 400,000 black men of Senegal were the troops that at the Marne and the Oureq stopped the first onset of Germans, filled the river with their dead and made the world’s greatest army re-cross on the dead corpses of their companions. France not only does not deny this—she is proud to acknowledge the debt.\nFor example, on December 29, 1918 the French Colonial League held in the Trocadéro in Paris a great celebration in honor of native troops who had come to fight for France. This celebration was sanctioned by President Poincaré and conducted in the presence of the ministers and the military Governor-General of Paris. Presiding were M. Henry Simon, Colonial Minister; M. Diagne, a Senegalese, Commissioner-General of Colonial Affairs; and M. Eugène Etienne, President of the French Colonial League.\nThe program, whose title page is here displayed, gives the following account of M. Diagne:\n\nM. Diagne, Deputy from Senegal, was made Commissioner-General of Colonial Affairs in the Cabinet of M. Clemenceau, as a result of the brilliant success of the last levy of troops in French West Africa. Under conditions calling for great tact and delicacy M. Diagne was able to render the most signal services to his country. He is administering with consummate ability his present office of Commissioner, which will involve the consideration of the numerous problems arising with respect to whatever is of special import to our black troops who throughout the war have conducted themselves with so much heroism.\n \nM. Diagne will give in his speech a detailed account of the loyalty of the native troops and will indicate the new obligations incumbent now on the mother country in recognition of the rights of naturalization which native troops have gained on the battle-fields which they as brothers shared with their white brothers.\n\nThe program mentions also the decoration of M. Bakhane Diop, an African chieftain. M. Diop stood between an Arab and an Annamite and all three received the crimson badge of the Legion. That was a wonderful sight. The passage in the program reads:\n\nThe Cross of Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, merited in action at the front by one of these chieftains, M. Bakhane Diop, will be bestowed upon him with all the usual ceremony by one of the glorious figures in our Colonial history, General Archinard, who ranks among the most active spirits in our penetration into Africa. The grandeur of the symbolic accolade, which will be given by General Archinard to Bakhane Diop, son of one of our most unyielding adversaries, will assuredly be one of the extremely stirring features in this celebration which is tendered by glorious France."

    "text": "As announced in the December, 1918, Crisis the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has undertaken to see that a scientific and exhaustive history of the black man in the Great War is written. The Association wishes to duplicate no work that others may do and it is especially anxious to co-operate to the fullest extent with all persons who know the facts and are acquainted with historical methods. Already the list of those co-operating with us is of considerable size and first importance.\nPreliminary to this work and with the idea of at once getting material and a point of view, I came to France. Quite by accident my trip was made on the same boat taken by Dr. R.R. Moton, of Tuskegee, who was going on a special trip arranged by Secretary of War Baker. Wherever possible Dr. Moton and I have gladly co-operated but our missions were distinct in every respect.\nAfter a rapid survey of the situation here I am venturing to send back a preliminary and tentative foreword to the history I hope to write. It is nothing more than a sketch—its details are lacking and some basic facts missing, but I think I have the main outlines.\nThe black soldier saved civilization in 1914-18. First, nearly 400,000 black men of Senegal were the troops that at the Marne and the Oureq stopped the first onset of Germans, filled the river with their dead and made the world’s greatest army re-cross on the dead corpses of their companions. France not only does not deny this—she is proud to acknowledge the debt.\nFor example, on December 29, 1918 the French Colonial League held in the Trocadéro in Paris a great celebration in honor of native troops who had come to fight for France. This celebration was sanctioned by President Poincaré and conducted in the presence of the ministers and the military Governor-General of Paris. Presiding were M. Henry Simon, Colonial Minister; M. Diagne, a Senegalese, Commissioner-General of Colonial Affairs; and M. Eugène Etienne, President of the French Colonial League.\nThe program, whose title page is here displayed, gives the following account of M. Diagne:\n\nM. Diagne, Deputy from Senegal, was made Commissioner-General of Colonial Affairs in the Cabinet of M. Clemenceau, as a result of the brilliant success of the last levy of troops in French West Africa. Under conditions calling for great tact and delicacy M. Diagne was able to render the most signal services to his country. He is administering with consummate ability his present office of Commissioner, which will involve the consideration of the numerous problems arising with respect to whatever is of special import to our black troops who throughout the war have conducted themselves with so much heroism.\n \nM. Diagne will give in his speech a detailed account of the loyalty of the native troops and will indicate the new obligations incumbent now on the mother country in recognition of the rights of naturalization which native troops have gained on the battle-fields which they as brothers shared with their white brothers.\n\nThe program mentions also the decoration of M. Bakhane Diop, an African chieftain. M. Diop stood between an Arab and an Annamite and all three received the crimson badge of the Legion. That was a wonderful sight. The passage in the program reads:\n\nThe Cross of Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, merited in action at the front by one of these chieftains, M. Bakhane Diop, will be bestowed upon him with all the usual ceremony by one of the glorious figures in our Colonial history, General Archinard, who ranks among the most active spirits in our penetration into Africa. The grandeur of the symbolic accolade, which will be given by General Archinard to Bakhane Diop, son of one of our most unyielding adversaries, will assuredly be one of the extremely stirring features in this celebration which is tendered by glorious France."

    "text": "II\nAmerica did not win the war by her fighting only. Her fighting both of colored and white troops covered less than a year of a four years’ war. America’s great contribution was her preparations which frightened Germany; and her sailors, engineers and laborers who made food and material available. Among these the black stevedores have won a world record. They have been the best workers in France, as is acknowledged by everybody, and their efficiency has been due in part to no small numbers of colored officers and under-officers and to colored Y.M.C.A. workers.\nBut America did some fighting and the most critical time of America’s fighting was in the terrible days of last fall when the exhausted French had to have re-inforcements or yield. It was here that among the first units sent to aid was the Ninety-third Division. The Ninety-third was not a division. It consisted of the Eighth Illinois, the Fifteenth New York, the Separate Battalions of Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Ohio, Company L of the Sixth Massachusetts and others. It was an aggregation nobody wanted. It could not under the draft law go with its state units, or, at least, the law was so interpreted. A whole division was planned to include Colonel Young—but dark forces intervened. Yet these units were ready for work, they were eager, and they were sent to the French and have become known as the 369th, 370th, 371st and 372d Regiments of the Ninety-third Division. Their black officers were transferred and changed considerably, but they went into battle practically with a complete roster of black officers except Colonels, a few Majors and several Captains. But most of the officers were black—for instance, the old Eighth Illinois, even after Colonel Dennison left, had a colored Lieutenant-Colonel, two colored Majors, nineteen colored Captains and ninety-eight colored First and Second Lieutenants. Colonel Hayward, of the old New York Fifteenth, succeeded in removing a larger proportion of his colored officers.\nSo at the most critical period of the American participation in the war these men went into action.\nWhat was the result?\nThe colored Lieutenant-Colonel of the 370th, a colored Major, eight colored Captains, seventeen colored Lieutenants, eight colored under-officers and twenty-six colored privates received the Croix de Guerre in November.\nOn November 11, General Vincenden, the French Commanding Officer, said of the 370th: “Fired by a noble ardor, they go at times even beyond the objectives given them by the higher command; they have always wished to be in the front line.” The final order of General Vincenden, December 9, said: “In the name of France, I thank you.” He mentioned the “hard and brilliant battles of Chavigny, Leury and the Bois de Beaumont.” He commends their “fine appearance under arms” like “silk unrolling in wavy folds.” He especially mentions the exploits of three battalions (two with all colored officers and one with a white Captain) at Val St. Pierre, Aubenton and Logny, where the colored Lieutenant-Colonel distinguished himself. “You have given us of your best and you have given it out of the fullness of your hearts. The blood of your comrades who fell on the soil of France, mixed with the blood of our soldiers, renders indissoluble the bonds of affection that unite us. We have, besides, the pride of having worked together at a magnificent task and the pride of bearing on our foreheads the ray of a common grandeur. A last time—Au Revoir!”\nThe 371st and 372d Infantries were brigaded with the 157th French Division under General Goybet. On the occasion of their leaving, December 15, the General in Order No. 245 said:\n\nFor seven months we have lived as brothers-at-arms, partaking of the same activities, sharing the same hardships and the same dangers. Side by side we took part in the great Champagne Battle, which was to be crowned by a tremendous victory. Never will the 157th Division forget the indomitable dash, the heroic rush of the American (Negro) regiments up the observatory ridge and into the Plain of Monthois. The most powerful defenses, the most strongly organized machine gun nests, the heaviest artillery barrages—nothing could stop them. These crack regiments overcame every obstacle with a most complete contempt for danger. Through their steady devotion the Red Band Division (157th French) for nine whole days’ of severe struggle was constantly leading the way for the victorious advance of the Fourth Army. Officers, non-commissioned officers and men, I respectfully salute our glorious comrades who have fallen, and I bow to your colors—side by side with this—the flag of the 333d Regiment of Infantry (French). They have shown us the way to victory. Dear Friends from America, when you reach the other side of the ocean, do not forget the Red Hand Division. Our brotherhood has been cemented in the blood of the brave, and such bonds will never be destroyed.”\n\nThe Distinguished Service Cross was given, December 16, to four colored officers, five colored privates and one colored corporal, of the 372d Regiment. On December 13, the following honors were given the 371st and 372d, Croix de Guerre to two colored corporals and to two colored privates. There were also seventy other citations.\nOn October 7, General Garnier Duplossis, of the Ninth French Army Corps “salutes the brave American (Negro) regiments who have rivalled in intrepidity their French comrades.”\nOn October 8, General Goybet (General Order 234) in submitting the above transmits “from the bottom of the heart of a chief and soldier the expression of the gratitude for the glory which you have sent to our good 157th Division.” The same day Colonel Quillet notes their “finest qualities of bravery and daring” in an order to the 372d Regiment. On the battlefield, October 1, General Goybet said: “You must be proud of the courage of your officers and men and I consider it an honor to have them under my command.” The 372d Regiment was cited as a whole for bravery and four Médailles Militaires and four Croix de Guerre were given. Similar words of farewell as went to the 370th Regiment were sent to this regiment.\nSo much for the soldiers brigaded with the French, to whom will be added later the equally fine record of the 369th (Fifteenth New York). In fine, the universal testimony of the French army is that black officers and men did extraordinarily well.\nThus much for the Ninety-third Division.\nThe Ninety-second Division went through hell. It was torn and shaken in morale, seriously so by General Ballou’s apparent anxiety to preserve a “Jim-Crow” régime for his officers and by the determination of men like Colonel Moss not to insist on respect to his colored officers. The Division seethed with bitterness and discontent, but it stuck to its work."

    "text": "III\nMeantime, anti-Negro prejudice was rampant in the American army and the officers particularly were subjected to all sorts of discrimination. Scandalous tales were spread in French towns and villages; some villages were posted “Niggers keep out!” Incidents like this continually recurred. A black chaplain with the rank of a Lieutenant reported for duty with colored stevedore regiments at Bordeaux. All the officers were white. He presented himself at the officers’ mess and was refused admission. He asked for meals in his room. That was contrary to regulations. He tried the non-commissioned officers’ mess. He was refused here because he was an officer. He asked them to send him meals. They refused. He tried to eat with the privates. Again regulations intervened. After a day of hunger and insult he was finally accommodated with a side table for himself in the officers’ mess-room.\nIn the fighting units not one-third of the white soldiers saluted colored officers; they were refused at officers’ clubs and in several cases openly disparaged before their men. In hospitals they were often refused admittance to officers’ quarters and placed with the privates. Gossip disparaging to the black officers filled the whole American army and clashes of white and colored soldiers ended in blood-shed in a number of cases.\nOn top of this came subtle German propaganda.\nThe following was dropped from a German balloon, September 3, 1918, near St. Dié and Raon-l’Etape:\n\nTO THE COLORED SOLDIERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY\n \nHello, boys, what are you doing over here? Fighting the Germane? Why? Have they ever done you any harm? Of course some white folks and the lying English-American papers told you that the Germans ought to be wiped out for the sake of humanity and democracy. What is democracy? Personal freedom, all citizens enjoying the same rights socially and before the law. Do you enjoy the same rights as the white people do in America, the land of freedom and democracy, or are you not rather treated over there as second-class citizens? Can you go into o restaurant where white people dine? Can you get a seat in the theatre where white people sit? Can you get a seat or a berth in the railroad car, or can you even ride in the South in the same street car with white people? And how about the law? Is lynching and the most horrible crimes connected therewith, a lawful proceeding in a democratic country? Now, all this is entirely different in Germany, where they do like colored people, where they treat them as gentlemen and as white men and quite a number of colored people have fine positions in business in Berlin and other German cities. Why, then, fight the Germans only for the benefit of the Wall Street robbers and to protect the millions they have loaned to the English, French and Italians? You have been made the tool of the egotistic and rapacious rich in England and America and there is nothing in the whole game for you but broken bones, horrible wounds, spoiled health or death. No satisfaction whatever will you get out of this unjust war. You have never seen Germany. So you are fools if you allow people to make you hate us. Come over and see for yourself. Let those do the fighting who make the profit out of this war. Don’t allow them to use you as cannon-fodder. To carry a gun in this service is not an honor, but a shame. Throw it away and come over to the German lines. You will find friends who will help you along."

    "text": "IV\nThe black men never wavered.\nWhy?\nBecause side by side with this treatment on the part of their own countrymen came the courtesy, the kindness and the utter lack of prejudice among the French. The black soldiers by their sweet-tempered consideration gained friends everywhere. They saw the wretched suffering of the French and they toiled and fought willingly for them. French officers and civilians of high social position vied with each other in doing all they could to show consideration. A Negro officer entered a café. The American white officers resented his seat at their table and started to rise—the French officers at a neighboring table very quietly and courteously nodded to the land-lady and the black officer found a welcome seat with them.\nSeveral high white southern officers of General Ballou’s staff blocked nearly everything that would help or encourage the black men—the Chief of Staff repeatedly refused permissions to the photographers, with the result that the Division has almost no photographic record of its work.\nBut it did work and fight.\nThe single colored artillery brigade, 167th Field Artillery, had a General from Massachusetts, Sherburne, who believed in them. He said in General Order 11 that he desired “to record his appreciation of the high qualities displayed by officers and men during the recent operations in this sector. They have been zealous soldiers and skilful artillerymen. Their recompense lies in their knowledge of work well done and in the commendation of those well qualified to speak. By day and night, often under a hail of shrapnel, often through clouds of deadly gas, they have marched and fought, dragged their guns sometimes by hand into the line, kept open their lines of communication and brought up their supplies always with a cheerfulness that earned them the admiration of all.”\nThe Division was repeatedly under fire. It went forward in the last great drive and was preparing to take part in the great assault on Metz when the armistice came.\nIn one instance alone has the white soldier been able even to disparage the actual work of colored troops. In that case a battalion of the 368th Regiment was put in as support and, quite contrary to plan, was suddenly rushed forward as storm troops without equipment. Caught between the two barrages they fell back, contrary to orders, but another battalion of colored men relieved them and went forward. Where was the fault? The white officer, found skulking in the rear, said it was the cowardice of Negro officers.\nSo the word to acknowledge the Negro stevedore and the fighting black private has gone forth, but the American army is going to return to America determined to disparage the black officer and eliminate him from the army despite his record. And the black officer and private? They return at once bitter and exalted! They will not submit to American caste and they will ever love France!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe War History (1919)\nRobert R.

    "text": "The suggestion has been made that these colonies which Germany has lost should not be handed over to any other nation of Europe but should, under the guidance of organized civilization, be brought to a point of development which shall finally result in an autonomous state. This plan has met with much criticism and ridicule. Let the natives develop along their own lines and they will “go back,” has been the cry. Back to what, in Heaven’s name?\nIs a civilization naturally backward because it is different? Outside of cannibalism, which can be matched in this country, at least, by lynching, there is no vice and no degradation in native African customs which can begin to touch the horrors thrust upon them by white masters. Drunkenness, terrible diseases, immorality, all these things have been the gifts of European civilization. There is no need to dwell on German and Belgian atrocities, the world knows them too well. Nor have France and England been blameless. But even supposing that these masters had been models of kindness and rectitude, who shall say that any civilization is in itself so superior that it must be super­ imposed upon another nation with­ out the expressed and intelligent con­ sent of the people most concerned. The culture indigenous to a country, its folk-customs, its art, all this must have free scope or there is no such thing as freedom for the world.\nThe truth is, white men are merely juggling with words—or worse—when they declare that the withdrawal of Europeans from Africa will plunge that continent into chaos. What Europe, and indeed only a small group in Europe, wants in, Africa is not a field for the spread of European civilization, but a field for exploita­tion. They covet the raw materials,—ivory, diamonds, copper and rubber in which the land abounds, and even more do they covet cheap native labor to mine and produce these things. Greed,—naked, pitiless lust for wealth and power, lie back of all of Europe’s interest in Africa and the white world knows it and is not ashamed.\nAny readjustment of Africa is not fair and cannot be lasting which does not consider the interests of native Africans and peoples of African descent. Prejudice, in European colonies in Africa, against the ambitious Negro is greater than in America, and that is saying much. But with the establishment of a form of gov­ernment which shall be based on the concept that Africa is for Africans, there would be a chance for the colored American to emigrate and to go as a pioneer to a country which must, sentimentally at least, possess for him the same fascination as England does for Indian-born English­men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHelping Africa (1924)\nKenya (1924)\nGermany (1916)\nSmuts (1930)\nAfrica for the Africans (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “Reconstruction and Africa.”\nThe Crisis 17 (4): 165–66. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/17/04/reconstruction_and_africa.html."

    "text": "In its endeavor to avoid any injustice toward Marcus Garvey and his followers, The Crisis has almost leaned backward. Notwithstanding his wanton squandering of hundreds of thousands of dollars we have refused to assume that he was a common thief. In spite of his monumental and persistent lying we have discussed only the larger and truer aspects of his propaganda. We have refrained from all comment on his trial and conviction for fraud. We have done this too in spite of his personal vituperation of the editor of The Crisis and persistent and unremitting repetition of falsehood after falsehood as to the editor’s beliefs and acts and as to the program of the N.A.A.C.P.\nIn the face, however, of the unbelievable depths of debasement and humiliation to which this demagog has descended in order to keep himself out of jail, it is our duty to say openly and clearly:\nMarcus Garvey is, without doubt, the most dangerous enemy of the Negro race in America and in the world. He is either a lunatic or a traitor. He is sending all over this country tons of letters and pamphlets appealing to Congressmen, business men, philanthropists and educators to join him on a platform whose half concealed planks may be interpreted as follows:\nThat no person of Negro descent can ever hope to become an American citizen.\nThat forcible separation of the races and the banishment of Negroes to Africa is the only solution of the Negro problem.\nThat race war is sure to follow any attempt to realize the program of the N.A.A.C.P.\nWe would have refused to believe that any man of Negro descent could have fathered such a propaganda if the evidence did not lie before us in black and white signed by this man. Here is a letter and part of a symposium sent to one of the most prominent business men of America and turned over to us; we select but a few phrases; the italics are ours:\nDo you believe the Negro to be a human being?\nDo you believe the Negro entitled to all the rights of humanity?\nDo you believe that the Negro should be taught not to aspire to the highest political positions in Governments of the white race, but to such positions among his own race in a Government of his own?\nWould you help morally or otherwise to bring about such a possibility? Do you believe that the Negro should be encouraged to aspire to the highest industrial and commercial positions in the countries of the white man in competition with him and to his exclusion?\nDo you believe that the Negro should be encouraged to regard and respect the rights of all other races in the same manner as other races would respect the rights of the Negro.\nThe pamphlets include one of the worst articles recently written by a Southern white man advocating the deportation of American Negroes to Liberia and several articles by Garvey and his friends. From one of Garvey’s articles we abstract one phrase:\n“THE WHITE RACE CAN BEST HELP THE NEGRO BY TELLING HIM THE TRUTH, AND NOT BY FLATTERING HIM INTO BELIEVING THAT HE IS AS GOOD ANY WHITE MAN.”\nNot even Tom Dixon or Ben Tillman or the hatefulest enemies of the Negro have ever stooped to a more vicious campaign than Marcus Garvey, sane or insane, is carrying on. He is not attacking white prejudice, he is grovelling before it and applauding it; his only attack is on men of his own race who are striving for freedom; his only contempt is for Negroes; his only threats are for black blood. And this leads us to a few plain words:\n\nNo Negro in America ever had a fairer and more patient trial than Marcus Garvey. He convicted himself by his own admissions, his swaggering monkey-shines in the court room with monocle and long tailed coat and his insults to the judge and prosecuting attorney.\nMarcus Garvey was long refused bail, not because of his color, but because of the repeated threats and cold blooded assaults charged against his organization. He himself openly threatened to “get” the District Attorney. His followers had repeatedly to be warned from intimidating witnesses and one was sent to jail therefor. One of his former trusted officials after being put out of the Garvey organization brought the long concealed cash account of the organization to this office and we published it. Within two weeks the man was shot in the back in New Orleans and killed. We know nothing of Garvey’s personal connection with these cases but we do know that today his former representative lies in jail in Liberia sentenced to death for murder. The District Attorney believed that Garvey’s “army” had arms and ammunition and was prepared to “shoot up” colored Harlem if he was released. For these and no other reasons Garvey was held in the Tombs so long without bail and until he had made abject promises, apologizing to the judge and withdrawing his threats against the District Attorney. Since his release he has not dared to print a single word against white folk. All his vituperation has been heaped on his own race.\n\nEverybody, including the writer, who has dared to make the slightest criticism of Garvey has been intimidated by threats and threatened with libel suits. Over fifty court cases have been brought by Garvey in ten years. After my first and favorable article on Garvey, I was not only threatened with death by men declaring themselves his followers, but received letters of such unbelievable filth that they were absolutely unprintable. When I landed in this country from my trip to Africa I learned with disgust that my friends stirred by Garvey’s threats had actually felt compelled to have secret police protection for me on the dock!\nFriends have even begged me not to publish this editorial lest I be assassinated. To such depths have we dropped in free black America! I have been exposing white traitors for a quarter century. If the day has come when I cannot tell the truth about black traitors it is high time that I died.\nThe American Negroes have endured this wretch all too long with fine restraint and every effort at cooperation and understanding. But the end has come. Every man who apologizes for or defends Marcus Garvey from this day forth writes himself down as unworthy of the countenance of decent Americans. As for Garvey himself, this open ally of the Ku Klux Klan should be locked up or sent home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMarcus Garvey and the NAACP (1928)\nMarcus Garvey (1921)\nRadicals (1919)\nA Correction (1921)\nHeroes (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1924. “A Lunatic or a Traitor.”\nThe Crisis 28 (1): 8–9. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/28/01/lunatic_or_a_traitor.html."

We think again and again of going over there and taking charge and helping people to do things better, leading them as we are overfond of saying, “from darkness into light.” Let us curb this custom of thinking with one or two after-thoughts.\nFirst, Africa is full; not perhaps full to the extent that Belgium is, or the Rheinpfalz, but it is full to the capacity of its present industrial development. It is not, save in a few places, an empty land inviting immigrants. Secondly, the Africans are not asleep. They are awake. Not as wide awake or as well-acquainted with modern civilization as many groups, but nevertheless awake and awakening, thrilling with new spirit and new determination. Thirdly, Africa belongs to the Africans. They have not the slightest intention of giving it up to foreigners, white or black. They propose to develop their own country and to be citizens thereof. They resent that attitude that assumes that other folk of any color are coming in to take and rule their land.\nLiberia for instance has held and defended her country with blood and tears for a hundred long and weary years. She is not going to allow American Negroes to assume control and to direct her government. Liberia, in her mind, is for Liberians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nReconstruction and Africa (1919)\nThe Drive (1922)\nKenya (1924)\nAfrica for the Africans (1921)\nLiberia (1927)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1924. “Helping Africa.” The Crisis\n28 (3): 106. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/28/03/helping_africa.html."

Hardwick was elected to Congress from Georgia on a platform the chief plank of which was the repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment; Vardaman of Mississippi has gone further than any American living or dead in capitalizing race hatred for political gain; and Blease is a demagogue of the Tillman type, with none of Tillman’s redeeming features. It is logical and deeply significant that precisely these Negro haters and fomentors of domestic strife are the ones whose defeat is most strongly demanded by those who wish to win the war against German despotism. Is this not significant, fellow Negroes?\nThe hatred and despising of men; the doctrine of innate and inborn racial superiority; the determination to settle spiritual values by physical force; the restriction of human sympathies to a minority of human beings—all these things are characteristic of German imperialism and of Blease, Vardaman, Hardwick and— Hoke Smith.

    "text": "The Town\nEstill Springs, the scene of the third within nine months of Tennessee’s burnings at the stake, is situated about seventy-four miles from Chattanooga, being midway between that city and Nashville. The town itself has only two hundred inhabitants; with the territory within the radius of a half-mile, about three hundred. Franklin County, in which Estill Springs is located, had a white population of 17,365 and 3,126 colored inhabitants in 1910, according to the census. Estill Springs is not incorporated and, therefore, has no mayor or village officials. It is a small settlement located midway between the larger and more progressive villages of Decherd and Tullahoma, each having about 2,000 inhabitants. Winchester, fifteen miles from Estill Springs, is the county seat.\nEstill Springs is made up of a small group of houses and stores gathered about the railway station. The main street is only three blocks long. Its few business establishments are located on one side of this street. There is one bank, the Bank of Estill Springs, purely local in nature; a barber shop, a drug store and five general merchandise stores of the type indigenous to small rural communities in the South. The settlement’s sole butcher left on the day that the investigator reached there, to work in a nitrate factory in a nearby town as the butcher trade of the community was not sufficient to support his shop. Simply stated, Estill Springs is one of thousands of small settlements of its type, poorly located from a geographic and economic standpoint and with little prospect of future growth. Its static condition, naturally, tends to make the minds of its inhabitants narrow and provincial. The people of the surrounding country are farmers and because of the failure of the cotton crop last fall, occasioned by an early frost, corn was the only crop on which they made money. Such of the people as were interviewed were leisurely of manner and slow of speech and comprehension.\nParadoxical as it may seem, in the light of the event which has put Estill Springs on the map in a kind of infamy of fame, the settlement seems to have a strong religious undercurrent. Small as the community is, it has four white churches, two Baptist, one Methodist and one Campbellite. In addition, there are two colored churches, one a Baptist and the other a Methodist, of which latter the Rev. G. W. Lych was pastor. There is a local Red Cross unit among the white women which was planning to inaugurate meetings to knit for the soldiers. In the windows of a number of homes, the emblem of the National Food Conservation Commission was displayed. The son of the proprietor of the only hotel is local agent for the sale of Thrift Stamps. The town purchased its allotment of both the first and second Liberty Loans."

    "section": "The Cause of the Trouble",
    "text": "The Cause of the Trouble\nAbout one mile from the railway station of Estill Springs, there lived a Negro by the name of Jim McIlherron. He resided with his mother, several brothers and father, who bears the reputation of being wealthy “for a Negro,” as he owns his own land and is prosperous in a small way. The McIlherrons do not appear to have been popular with the white community. They were known as a family which resented “slights” and “insults” and which did not willingly allow its members to be imposed upon by unfriendly whites. However, there appears to have been no serious trouble between them and their white neighbors up to the time of the street fight which resulted in the shooting for which Jim McIlherron was later burned at the stake. One white woman expressed in a local phrase the opinion of the family when she said that the McIlherron family were “big-buggy niggers,” meaning that they were prosperous enough to have a few articles other than bare necessities, among these being a larger buggy than was common in the section. Most of the whites in the locality, it must be explained, were of the poorer country folk.\nJim McIlherron bore the reputation in Estill Springs of being a “bad sort.” It was gathered from remarks made that this implied that he shared the family characteristic already alluded to of resenting “slights” and “insults.” In other words, he was not what is termed “a good nigger,” which in certain portions of the South means a colored man or woman who is humble and submissive in the presence of white “superiors.”\nMcIlherron was known to be a fighter and the possessor of an automatic revolver. (Laws against “gun-toting” are observed in the breach, apparently, in this region.) He was, therefore, classed as a dangerous man to bother with. A little over a year before the lynching, he became involved in a fight with his own brother in which the latter was cut with a knife wielded by the former. For this he was arrested by Sheriff John Rose, the sheriff of Franklin County. At the time of this affair, McIlherron threatened to “get” the sheriff if he was ever arrested again by that officer. It is an admitted fact in the community that the sheriff was afraid of McIlherron. Soon after the trouble with his brother, McIlherron went to Indianapolis where he worked in an industrial plant, proceeding later to Detroit. In Detroit he had an attack of rheumatism and was forced to return to his home shortly before the shooting. His having lived in the North tended to increase his disfavor with the white people of the community, as he was credited with having absorbed during his residence there certain ideas of “independence” which were not acceptable to the white citizens of this small rural community.\nSharing popular disfavor with McIlherron was the pastor of the Methodist church in Estill Springs, the Rev. G. W. Lych. He had repeatedly advised the colored people to assert their right to be free from the petty tyranny alleged to have been imposed upon them by the white people, assuring them that they were made of the same clay and were as good as anybody else."

    "section": "The Shooting",
    "text": "The Shooting\nOn the afternoon of Friday, February 8, Jim McIlherron went into a store in the town and purchased fifteen cents’ worth of candy. In Estill Springs it had been a habit of an element of young white men to “rock” Negroes in the community—i.e., throwing rocks or other missiles at them to make them run. This had occasioned frequent tilts between the races none of which, however, had previously been serious. McIlherron had been the victim of one of these “rockings” and had declared that if ever they got after him again, somebody was going to get hurt. When the trouble started on February 8, it was about five o’clock in the afternoon, in the gloom of early nightfall. It is probable that the Negro believed that they were after him again. He walked down the street eating this candy, going past Tate & Dickens’ store in front of which he encountered three young white men, Pierce Rogers, Frank Tigert and Jesse Tigert by name. As McIlherron passed them a remark was made by one of the young men about his eating the candy. The others laughed and several more remarks were made. At this the Negro turned and asked if they were talking about him. Words followed, becoming more and more heated, until threats began to be passed between them. One of the young men started into the store whereupon McIlherron, apparently believing, as one of our white informants said, that they were preparing to start a fight, pulled out his gun and started shooting. Six shots were fired, two taking effect in each man. Rogers died in his tracks, Jesse Tigert died about twenty minutes later and Frank Tigert was carried to the office of Dr. O. L. Walker, Estill Springs’ only physician, where he received medical aid. The latter will recover, as his wounds are not serious."

    "section": "The Man Hunt",
    "text": "The Man Hunt\nImmediately after the shooting, McIlherron, in the attendant excitement, ran down the road leading toward his home. There was no immediate pursuit by the whites. Although everybody knew that he had gone to his home, the white people waited and sent all the way to Winchester, the county seat, some fifteen miles distant, at a cost of sixty dollars, to secure blood-hounds. When these arrived, they succeeded in tracking him only as far as his home, where the scent was lost.\nIntense excitement prevailed in the town as news of the shooting spread. In this chaotic state of affairs, no one seemed to know what to do and threats of lynching began to be made. A few of the cooler heads pleaded that the crowd allow the sheriff to handle the entire affair. Knowing of the sheriff’s fear of the Negro, the crowd greeted this suggestion with a derisive shout, and cries of “Lynch the nigger” answered this plea. Plans were laid to form posses to catch McIlherron. Word was sent to Sheriff Rose at Winchester, upon receiving which he immediately left for Estill Springs.\nShouts of “Electrocution is too good for the damned nigger,” “Let’s burn the black——” and others of the sort rose thick and fast. Led by its more radical members, the mob soon worked itself into a frenzy; a posse was formed and set out on the manhunt.\nMeanwhile, McIlherron had gone to his home, gathered his few clothes and proceeded to the home of Lych, who aided him in his flight. On two mules they set out in the direction of McMinnville, in an attempt to reach the Tennessee Central Railroad where McIlherron could get a train that would take him to safety. The preacher went a part of the way with McIlherron and then returned to his home in Prairie Springs, a small settlement about twelve miles from Estill Springs. The news soon spread that Rev. Lych had aided McIlherron in his flight and a part of the mob went to Prairie Springs to “get” him for this. Two members came upon him near his home. One of them pointed his gun at the preacher and pulled the trigger. The gun did not go off, and before he could fire again, Lych snatched the gun from his assailant’s hands, broke it and started towards the man with the stock in his hands, when the other man fired a charge into the preacher’s breast, killing him instantly.\nThe hunt for McIlherron continued throughout Friday night, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, large posses of men scouring the surrounding county for him. Monday night he was located in a barn near Lewer Collins River, just beyond McMinnville. The barn was surrounded and the posse began firing on it. The Negro answered the fire, this state of affairs continuing throughout Monday night. During this time McIlherron succeeded in holding off the crowd, whose numbers were rapidly augmented, when the news spread that the Negro had been located. In the hundred or more men in the posses were Deputy Sheriff S. J. Byars and Policeman J. M. Bain. In the fusillade of bullets poured into the barn, McIlherron was wounded, one eye being shot out. He also received two body wounds, one in the arm and one in the leg. Finally, McIlherron’s ammunition gave out and, weak from the loss of blood, he was forced to surrender when the barn was rushed. When captured, the triumphant members of the mob carried him into McMinnville. The feeling against him was so great that an attempt was made to lynch him in the town of McMinnville, but the citizens of that town refused to allow a lynching in their midst and were able to prevent it from happening. McIlherron was, therefore, placed on Train No. 5, en route to Estill Springs, where he arrived at 6:30 P. M. on Tuesday."

    "text": "The Crowd\nIn the meantime, news of the capture spread like wild fire and men, women and children started pouring into the town to await the arrival of the victim. They came from a radius of fifty miles, coming from Coalmont, Winchester, Decherd, Tullahoma, McMinnville and from the country districts. In buggies and automobiles, on foot, on mules, they crowded into the little settlement, until it was estimated that from 1,500 to 2,000 people were in the town. A high state of excitement prevailed as the time for the arrival of the train drew near. Threats of the torture to be inflicted were made on many sides. Boxes, excelsior and other inflammable material were gathered in readiness for the event, and iron bars and pokers were obtained. Most of the crowd were grim and silent, but there were some who laughed and joked in anticipation of the coming event.\nFinally, the train drew near. McIlherron was so weak upon arrival, from the loss of blood due to three wounds received in the battle with the posse, that he was unable to stand and had to be carried to the spot selected for his execution. The leaders of the mob decided that he should be lynched on the exact spot where the shooting occurred. He was, therefore, carried to this place where preparations for the funeral pyre were made. The cries of the crowd grew more and more vengeful as the moments passed.\nJust as the arrangements had been completed, a few of the braver spirits among the women of the town demanded that the Negro be not burned in the town itself, but be taken out a little way in the country. There were loud objections to this proposal from the now uncontrollable mob. The women insisted, in spite of these objections, and finally it was decided to carry McIlherron across the railroad into a small clump of woods in front of the Campbellite church. This was done and the mob transferred its activities to the new execution ground.\nThe self-appointed leaders of the mob by this time had great difficulty in restraining the wild fury of the crowd. They were constantly forced to appeal to them not to strike McIlherron or to spit on him, but to allow the affair to be a “perfectly orderly lynching.” The sister of one of the men slain was in the mob and had become frantic in her pleas to the men to let her kill the Negro. She demanded that he be killed immediately, not to allow him to live another moment. It was evident that such a humane thing as instant death would not have appeased the blood-thirst of the mob, in its revengeful mood."

    "section": "The Torture",
    "text": "The Torture\nOn reaching the spot chosen for the burning, McIlherron was chained to a hickory tree. The wood and other inflammable material already collected was saturated with coal oil and piled around his feet. The fire was not lighted at once, as the crowd was determined “to have some fun with the damned nigger” before he died. A fire was built a few feet away and then the fiendish torture began. Bars of iron, about the size of an ordinary poker, were placed in the fire and heated to a red-hot pitch. A member of the mob took one of these and made as if to burn the Negro in the side. McIlherron seized the bar and as it was jerked from his grasp all of the inside of his hand came with it, some of the skin roasting on the hot iron. The awful stench of burning human flesh rose into the air, mingled with the lustful cries of the mob and the curses of the: suffering Negro. Cries of “Burn the damned hound,” “Poke his eyes out,” and others of the kind came in thi « confusion from the mob. Men, women and children, who were too far in the rear, surged forward in an attempt to catch sight of and gloat over the suffering of the Negro.\nNow that the first iron had been applied, the leaders began eagerly to torture McIlherron. Men struggled with one another, each vying with his fellow, in attempting to force from the lips of the Negro some sign of weakening. A wide iron bar, redhot, was placed on the right side of his neck. When McIlherron drew his head away, another bar was placed on the left side. This appeared to amuse the crowd immensely and approving shouts arose, as the word was passed back to those in the rear of what was going on. Another rod was heated and, as McIlherron squirmed in agony, thrust through the flesh of his thigh, and a few minutes later another through the calf of his leg. Meanwhile, a larger bar had been heating, and while those of the mob close enough to see shouted in fiendish glee, this was taken and McIlherron was unsexed.\nThe unspeakable torture had now been going on for about twenty minutes and the Negro was mercifully getting weaker and weaker. The mob seemed to be getting worked up to a higher and higher state of excitement. The leaders racked their brains for newer and more devilish ways of inflicting torture on the helpless victim.\nThe newspapers stated that McIlherron lost his nerve and cringed before the torture, but the testimony of persons who saw the burning is to the effect that this is untrue. It seems inconceivable that any person could endure the awful torture inflicted, however great his powers of resistance to pain, and not lose his nerve. The statements of onlookers are to the effect that throughout the whole burning Jim McIlherron never cringed and never once begged for mercy. He was evidently able to deny the mob the satisfaction of seeing his nerve broken, although he lived for half an hour after the burning started. Throughout the whole affair he cursed those who tortured him and almost to the last breath derided the attempts of the mob to break his spirit. The only signs of the awful agony that he must have suffered were the involuntary groans that escaped his lips, in spite of his efforts to check them, and the wild look in his eyes as the torture became more and more severe. At one time, he begged his torturers to shoot him, but this request was received with a cry of derision at his vain hope to be put out of his misery. His plea was answered with the remark, “We ain’t half through with you yet, nigger.”\nBy this time, however, some of the members of the mob had, apparently, become sickened at the sight and urged that the job be finished. Others in the rear of the crowd, who had not been able to see all that took place, objected and pushed forward to take the places of some of those in front. Having succeeded in this, they began to “do their bit” in the execution. Finally, one man poured coal oil on the Negro’s trousers and shoes and lighted the fire around McIlherron’s feet. The flames rose rapidly, soon enveloping him, and in a few minutes McIlherron was dead.\n\nGeorge McNeel, Lynched in Monroe, LA., March 16, 1918.\nThe Grand Jury Found “No information sufficient to Indict” the lynchers, but this postcard was sold on the streets “to white people” at 25 cents each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Tragedy of ‘Jim Crow’ (1923)\nThe Burning at Dyersburg: An N.A.A.C.P.

    "text": "An investigation by Walter F. White, Assistant Secretary, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in Brooks and Lowndes Counties, Georgia.\nThe recent strong letter of President Wilson on lynching was undoubtedly called forth by representations from colored people following the lynchings in Brooks and Lowndes Counties, Ga., May 17–24. Hampton Smith, a white farmer, was killed, and newspaper dispatches report six persons as having been lynched for complicity. Investigation shows that at least eleven persons were killed.\nBrooks and Lowndes Counties are situated in the southernmost part of the state of Georgia, near the Florida line. They are in the heart of the richest section of the state.\nHampton Smith, whose murder was the immediate cause of the holocaust of lynchings, was the owner of a large plantation in Brooks County. He bore a very poor reputation in the community because of ill treatment of his Negro employees.\nSmith’s reputation in this respect had become so wide-spread that he had the greatest difficulty in securing any help whatever. He, therefore, adopted the expedient of going into the courts and whenever a Negro was convicted and was unable to pay his fine or was sentenced to serve a period in the chain-gang, Smith would secure his release and put him to work out his fine on his (Smith’s) plantation. Sidney Johnson, the Negro who admitted before his death that he killed Smith, had been fined thirty dollars for gaming. Smith paid his fine and Johnson was put at work on the former’s plantation until the thirty dollars had been worked out. Johnson had worked out the period and had put in considerable more time and had asked Smith to pay him for the additional time that he had served. Smith refused and a quarrel resulted. A few days later Johnson did not show up for work in the fields and Smith went to Johnson’s cabin to discover the reason. Johnson told Smith that he was sick and unable to work. Smith thereupon began to beat him, in spite of the protestations of the victim. Johnson is said then to have threatened Smith and a few nights later, while sitting in his home, Smith was shot twice through the window near which he was sitting, dying instantly. His wife was also shot, the bullet passing through the center of her breast, miraculously missing both her heart and lungs. Her wound is not believed to be serious. The attending physician, Dr. McMichael, is said to have stated that she would recover.\nThere seems to be no evidence that Mrs. Smith was raped in addition to being shot.\nAs soon as news of the murder reached the community, great crowds of men and boys from the two counties hurried to the spot. Excitement ran high and posses were immediately formed to search for Johnson, as suspicion was immediately fastened on him because of the threats he had made against Smith’s life. There was also talk of a conspiracy among a number of Negroes to kill Smith, and reports were circulated that the group involved had met at the home of Hayes Turner, another Negro who had suffered at the hands of Smith, and his wife, Mary Turner, whom Smith had beaten on several occasions. Hayes Turner, it is said, had previously served a term in the chain-gang for threatening Smith, following Smith’s beating of Turner’s wife. Nevertheless, after his release, Turner had gone back to work for Smith again.\nThe first of the mob’s victims to be captured was Will Head, a Negro of the community, who was caught on Friday morning, May 17, at 8:30, near Barney, Georgia; the second was Will Thompson, seized later on the same day. That night both were lynched near Troupeville, about five miles from Valdosta. Members of the mob stated to the investigator that over seven hundred bullets were fired into the bodies of the two men. The investigator learned from a man who admitted being in the mob, but who stated that he had no part in the lynching, the names of the two leaders of the Friday night mob and of fifteen of the other members of the mob. These names were given to the investigator on his promise that he would not divulge the name of the informant, as to do so would mean that he would undoubtedly be subjected to bodily violence and perhaps death, for having given the information. These names were furnished to Governor Hugh M. Dorsey, of Georgia, on July 10, by the investigator in person.\nIn addition to those named to the Governor there were many more from Quitman and a large number from Valdosta and the surrounding country whose names were not learned.\nOn Saturday morning Hayes Turner was captured and lynched near the fork of the Morven and Barney roads. On being captured he was placed in the Quitman jail and for some reason unknown to the investigator was taken later in the day by Sheriff Wade and Roland Knight, the clerk of the county court, ostensibly to be carried to Moultrie for safekeeping. Turner was taken from these men en route to Moultrie, at the fork of the roads about three and a half miles from town. He was lynched with his hands fastened behind him with handcuffs and was allowed to hang there until Monday when he was cut down by county convicts and buried about half a hundred feet from the foot of the tree on which he was lynched. During Sunday following the lynching, hundreds of automobiles, buggies and wagons bore sightseers to the spot while many more tramped there on foot.\nAnother Negro was lynched on Saturday afternoon near Morven at a spot known as the Old Camp Ground. This person may have been Eugene Rice whose name appeared in the Georgia press among the identified and acknowledged victims, but who was never even remotely connected with Hampton Smith’s killing.\nAbout a week after the tragedy, or tragedies, started, the bodies of three unidentified Negroes were taken from the Little River, below Barney. It is not known whether these bodies were those of some already accounted for or whether these were additional victims of the mob. At the last accounts the bodies themselves had disappeared and could not be located.\nThe murder of the Negro men was deplorable enough in itself, but the method by which Mrs. Mary Turner was put to death was so revolting and the details are so horrible that it is with reluctance that the account is given. It might be mentioned that each detail given is not the statement of a single person but each phase is related only after careful investigation and corroboration. Mrs. Turner made the remark that the killing of her husband on Saturday was unjust and that if she knew the names of the persons who were in the mob that lynched her husband, she would have warrants sworn out against them and have them punished in the courts.\nThis news determined the mob to “teach her a lesson” and although she attempted to flee when she heard that they were after her, she was captured at noon on Sunday. The grief-stricken and terrified woman was taken to a lonely and secluded spot, down a narrow road over which the trees touch at their tops, which, with the thick undergrowth on either side of the road; made a gloomy and appropriate spot for the lynching. Near Folsom’s Bridge over the Little River a tree was selected for her execution—a small oak tree extending over the road.\nAt the time she was lynched, Mary Turner was in her eighth month of pregnancy. The delicate state of her health, one month or less previous to delivery, may be imagined, but this fact had no effect on the tender feelings of the mob. Her ankles were tied together and she was hung to the tree, head downward. Gasoline and oil from the automobiles were thrown on her clothing and while she writhed in agony and the mob howled in glee, a match was applied and her clothes burned from her person. When this had been done and while she was yet alive, a knife, evidently one such as is used in splitting hogs, was taken and the woman’s abdomen was cut open, the unborn babe falling from her womb to the ground. The infant, prematurely born, gave two feeble cries and then its head was crushed by a member of the mob with his heel. Hundreds of bullets were then fired into the body of the woman, now mercifully dead, and the work was over.\nChime Riley, another Negro who was supposed to have left the community, was found by the investigator to have been lynched instead. By the time that he was killed, the mob evidently had begun to become fearful of too many outrages and determined to conceal his body. Although no one seems to have even remotely connected him with the murder of Smith, he was lynched, his hands and feet tied together and turpentine cups, made of clay and used to catch the gum from the pine trees when “chipped,” thus becoming very heavy, were tied to his body and he was thrown into the Little River near Barney. The informant in this case, seen on the spot where Mary Turner was lynched, stated that when the river was low he had gone down to see if the body had come up. Finding no trace of the body, he assumed that it had become lodged in a sand bar. He stated that he found one of the cups, however, which he was keeping as a “souvenir.”\nDuring the outbreak, another Negro by the name of Simon Schuman, who lived on the Moultrie Road near Berlin, was called to the door of his home one night between eight and nine o’clock. He was seized and had not been seen since up to the time (seven weeks later) that the investigator was in the section. The interior of his house was demolished, his family being driven out, and the furniture was hacked to pieces. His family, at the time of the investigator’s visit, was living on the Bryce Plantation, near Berlin. The offense alleged against Schuman is unknown.\nContrary to press reports, Sidney Johnson was not hiding in the swamps near Valdosta, but was in Valdosta from the time of the murder of Smith to the time that he was killed. During this time, he is said to have made the statement to several persons that he alone, was implicated in the killing of Smith and that he alone killed him. There was no suspicion of Johnson’s presence in Valdosta until Johnson went to another Negro, John Henry Bryant by name, and asked for food and aid in making good his escape. Apparently it was Johnson’s intention to wait until the vigilance of the mobs was relaxed and the roads no longer watched and then flee from the country. Bryant gave Johnson the food and then hastened to town to tell where Johnson was. The house was immediately surrounded by a posse headed by Chief of Police Dampier. This was done with caution as Johnson was known to be armed and had sworn that he would never be taken alive. Johnson had only a shot-gun and a revolver, while the posse was armed with high-powered rifles. The firing began and the Chief was wounded in the hand and one of his men in the neck.\nAfter the firing had gone on for a few minutes, Johnson’s firing ceased. A few more bullets were fired into the house for good measure as it was thought that the cessation of firing might be a ruse on Johnson’s part. When it did not resume, still acting cautiously, the house was rushed and Johnson’s body was found, dead. Cheated out of its prey, the crowd took the body, unsexed it with a sharp knife, threw the amputated parts into the street in front of the house, and then tied an end of a rope around Johnson’s neck. The other end was tied to the back of an automobile and the body dragged in open daylight down Patterson Street, one of Valdosta’s business thoroughfares, and out to a place near Barney and near the scene of the crime. There the dead body was fastened to a tree and burned to a crisp.\nVery careful attention was given by the investigator to the accounts given at the outbreak of the affair that it was caused by the circulation of pro-German propaganda in the section prior to the outbreak in the hope of stirring up racial disturbances. Absolutely no evidence was found.\nSince the lynchings, more than five hundred Negroes have left the immediate vicinity of Valdosta alone and many more have expressed the determination that they too were going to leave as soon as they could dispose of their lands and gather their crops. This wholesale migration occurred in spite of threats made that any Negro who attempted to leave the section would thus show that he was implicated in the murder of Smith and would be dealt with accordingly. Hundreds of acres of untilled land flourishing with weeds and dozens of deserted farm-houses give their own mute testimony of the Negroes’ attitude toward a community in which lynching mobs are allowed to visit vengeance upon members of their race.\nAll of the facts outlined above, including the names of mob leaders and participants, were given in a memorandum presented by the investigator on July 10 to Governor Hugh M. Dorsey. Governor Dorsey received the information gladly and has promised to take action on the evidence submitted. In a message addressed to the Georgia legislature on July 3, 1918, Governor Dorsey denounced mob violence in strong terms, saying:\n\nMob violence should be suppressed, and by State authorities.\n\nIf this is not done, it is very probable that Federal intervention will not be long delayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLynching (1927)\nThe Flag (1911)\nLynchings and Mobs (1921)\nCauses of Lynching (1931)\nLynching (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nWalter F., White. 1918. “The Work of a Mob.”\nThe Crisis 16 (5): 221–23. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/16/05/work_of_a_mob.html."

    "text": "A plan of far-reaching constructive effort to satisfy the pressing grievances of colored Americans has been under serious consideration by the military authorities at Washington for two months. On June 15, Dr. Du Bois was called in and asked if he would accept a captaincy in a bureau of the General Staff, if one was established, for the above purposes. Dr. Du Bois replied that he would, provided he could retain general oversight of The Crisis, and provided that his captain’s salary (which was $1,000 less than his present salary) could be supplemented from The Crisis income, so that he would suffer no financial loss. The military authorities saw no objection to these conditions. Dr. Du Bois then consulted the President of the Board of Directors of the N.A.A.C.P., the chairman and the acting chairman of the Board and several members, including Dr. H. C. Bishop, Bishop Hurst, Dr. Bentley, Mr. A. H. Grimke, Colonel Charles Young, Rev. G. R. Waller, Hon. Charles Nagel and Dr. V. Morton-Jones. All of them, except Mr. Grimke, agreed with the conditions and urged acceptance. Mr. Grimke expressed deep sympathy, but asked more time for consideration. No decision, however, as to establishing the Bureau was arrived at and when the regular July meeting of the Board took place, the priority of the Government’s claim on Dr. Du Bois was recognized, but doubt was expressed as to the advisability of his continuing in charge of The Crisis.\nA puzzling dilemma between devotion to his life work and duty to his country in time of war was thus forced upon Dr. Du Bois. His final conclusion, painful as it had to be, was to accept the commission. When thousands are giving their lives to their country, how could he long hesitate in risking far less? This delicate situation was further complicated by vague rumors which led friends of the Association with more zeal than thought to charge the Government with attempted “bribery” and Dr. Du Bois with being a “traitor.” Some who disagreed with the July editorials of The Crisis saw in them further evidences of a “corrupt bargain,” not knowing that those editorials were written two weeks before Dr. Du Bois had the slightest intimation that his services were to be asked, and were in print before he reached Washington.\nFinally, the General Staff, after carefully considering the matter from all angles, has decided not to establish the proposed bureau “at present” as its broad scope might lead “beyond the proper limits of military activity.”\nHere the matter rests. It is deplorable that this splendid and statesmanlike plan has been abandoned and equally unfortunate that any question as to its desirability should have ever arisen among black folk. The personal side of it is of less consequence and has left Dr. Du Bois in unruffiled serenity. No one who essays to teach the multitude can long escape crucifixion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nDr. Du Bois Resigns (1934)\nRobert R.

We wish to use our every endeavor to keep all of these 12,000,000 people at the highest pitch, not simply of passive loyalty, but of active, enthusiastic and self-sacrificing participation in the war.\nWe are not unmindful of the recognition of our American citizenship in the draft, of the appointment of colored officers, of the designation of colored advisors to the Government departments and of other indications of a broadened public opinion; nevertheless, we believe today that justifiable grievances of the colored people are producing not disloyalty, but an amount of unrest and bitterness which even the best efforts of their leaders may not be always able to guide, unless they can have the active and sympathetic cooperation of the National and State governments. German propaganda among us is powerless, but the apparent indifference of our own Government may be dangerous.\nThe American Negro does not expect to have the whole Negro problem settled immediately; he is not seeking to hold-up a striving country and a distracted world by pushing irrelevant personal grievances as a price of loyalty; he is not disposed to catalogue, in this tremendous crisis, all his complaints and disabilities; he is more than willing to do his full share in helping to win the war for democracy and he expects his full share of the fruits thereof; — but he is today compelled to ask for that minimum of consideration which will enable him to be an efficient fighter for victory, namely:\n\nBetter conditions of public travel.\nThe acceptance of help where help is needed regardless of the color of the helper.\nThe immediate suppression of lynching.\n\nAll these things are matters, not simply of justice, but of National and group efficiency; they are actions designed to still the natural unrest and apprehension among one-eighth of our citizens so as to enable them wholeheartedly and unselfishly to throw their every ounce of effort into this mighty and righteous war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nClose Ranks (1918)\nThe Present (1917)\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nReturning Soldiers (1919)\nResolutions of the Washington Conference (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1918. “Help Us to Help.”\nThe Crisis 16 (4): 163–64. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/16/04/help_us.html."

Our country is at war. The war is critical, dangerous and worldwide. If this is OUR country, then this is OUR war. We must fight it with every ounce of blood and treasure.\nSECOND, Our country is not perfect. Few countries are. We have our memories and our present grievances. This nation has sinned against the light, but it has not sinned as Germany has sinned. Its continued existence and development is the hope of mankind and of black mankind, and not its menace. We must fight, then, for the survival of the Best against the threats of the Worst.\nTHIRD, But what of our wrongs, cry a million voices with strained faces and bitter eyes. Our wrongs are still wrong. War does not excuse Disfranchisement, “Jim-Crow” cars and social injustices, but it does make our first duty clear. It does say deep to the heart of every Negro American: We shall not bargain with our loyalty. We shall not profiteer with our country’s blood. We shall not hesitate the fraction of a second when the God of Battles summons his dusky warriors to stand before the armposts of His Throne. Let them who call for sacrifice in this awful hour of Pain fight for the rights that should be ours; let them who make the laws write beneath each enactment that oppresses us,—but we?

Before Time was, we are. We have seen Egypt and Ethiopia, Babylon and Persia, Rome and America, and for that flaming Thing, Crucified Right, which survived all this staggering and struggling of men—for that we fight today in and for America—not for a price, not for ourselves alone, but for the World.\nFIFTH, Protest, my brother, and grumble. I have seen the Vision and it shall not fade. We want victory for ourselves—dear God, how terribly we want it—but it must not be cheap bargaining, it must be clean and glorious, won by our manliness, and not by the threat of the footpad. In the day of our lowest travail we did not murder children and rape women to bring our freedom nearer. We played the game and freedom came. So, too, today our souls are ours, but our bodies belong to our country.\nPatience, then, without compromise; silence without surrender; grim determination never to cease striving until we can vote, travel, learn, work and enjoy in peace—all this, and yet with it and above it all the tramp of our armies over the blood-stained lillies of France to show the world again what the loyalty and bravery of black men means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nClose Ranks (1918)\nPeace (1933)\nForward (1920)\nReturning Soldiers (1919)\nThirteen (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1918. “A Philosophy in Time of War.”\nThe Crisis 16 (4): 164–65. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/16/04/philosophy_in_time_of_war.html."

It is not strange that the time is approaching and practically is upon us when the stream of financial help from this source is beginning to cease.

If we black folk want college training for our children, we have got to furnish it out of our own pockets. This is a harsh conclusion and in many respects an unfair burden. If men were wise and if sociology were a science, it would be easy for Negroes to show the people of the United States that the safest and greatest investment that this country could make of a thousand millions of dollars during the next decade would be the establishment of a series of Negro universities and higher technical schools throughout the United States. But the nation does not see it and it will not see it for one hundred years. Human beings today have been educated to the point where they recognize the need of philanthropy for the hungry, the cripple, the grossly ignorant. Many have been educated also to see the just demand of philanthropy for the diseased, the weak and the half-trained. Beyond this, however, it is difficulty to get philanthropy to go. Thorough education and higher training still seem to most people a luxury and an indulgence and we must recognize these facts. We ourselves, however, know that if the Negro is to survive in this world as a man of thought and power, a co-worker with the leading races in civilization, a free, independent citizen of a modern democracy, then the foundations for this future must be laid in the Negro university. This much we know, but hitherto we have not realized that we have got to pay the bill for this education."

There is nothing to prevent today a white man from refusing to marry a colored woman. There is no law compelling a white woman to take a Negro mate. Decent custom in all civilized communities compels the scoundrel who seduces a girl to marry her no matter what race she belongs to. Does decency ask change in such custom? There are laws which say that if white people wish to consort with colored people they must marry.

Mississippi makes inter-racial marriage illegal and Mississippi has 122,000 acknowledged mulattoes.

    "text": "Walter White has written in “The Fire in the Flint” a good, stirring story and a strong bit of propaganda against the white Klansman and the black pussyfoot. White knows his Georgia from A to Z. There is not a single incident or a single character in the book which has not its prototype in real life today. All Mr. White’s white people are not villains nor are all his Negroes saints, but one gets a thrilling sense of the devilish tangle that involves good and evil in the southern South.\nPerhaps most significant however is the fact that a book like this can at last be printed. For years a flood of filth about the Negro has poured out of the South while no northern firm would consider a book telling even temperately the well-known and widely proven facts concerning the Negro. Subtly and slowly the change has come and Mr. White has been among the first to sense it and to persist courageously and doggedly in having his say.\nOf course one can criticise any book and particularly a first one. Perhaps on the economic side Mr. White succumbs too easily to the common mistake of piling the blame of southern wickedness on the “poor whites” and absolving the aristocrats and former slave holders. This is, of course, based on the propaganda which the sons and daughters of slave-barons have spread, but it is far from true. On the human and artistic side, with the possible exception of the younger brother, Mr. White’s characters do not live and breathe and compel our sympathy. They are more like labeled figures on a chess board. But despite all this, this story goes and the reader goes with it and that is the first business of a story.\n\n“The Southern Oligarchy” by William H. Skaggs is the most important volume that has come out of the white south since the Civil War. Every intelligent Negro should buy it and own it, even if it does cost five dollars. It is an astonishing vindication of our cause. It is written by a white southerner born and bred in Alabama and it traces the history of oligarchical government in the South from the beginning of slavery down to the present time. While the book is in no sense a pro-Negro document (rather it is distinctly a treatise to defend the poor white), nevertheless Mr. Skaggs’ incidental defense of the Negro is remarkable. He says for instance: “An epitome of the Negro’s history since his emancipation will show conclusively that his civic and industrial progress has been most remarkable. The truth of this assertion can be proven not only by the records which are available to all intelligent people, who are seeking the truth, but also by the testimony of the most intelligent and reputable white men of the Southern States.”\nHe declares in regard to disfranchisement that “the plans of the leaders of the Oligarchy were not primarily to shut out the Negro vote. The Negro had ceased to vote. The first and essential purpose of further encroachment on the liberties of the people was to make the Oligarchy more secure in its control of the Government. Ballot-box stuffing and other forms of corrupt practices had become so common that every branch of State and county administration was notoriously corrupt and, in many places, important official positions were held by corrupt politicians and their incompetent subordinates. Crimes were increasing and the South was prostrated under the rule of a privileged class of spoilsmen whose gain in power was in proportion to the public loss of moral stamina, intelligence, civic virtue and patriotism.” Later on he says: “The sins of carpet-bag rule in the South, as shown in a preceding chapter, were not the result of Negro enfranchisement, nor has the Negro been disfranchised to prevent a recurrence of carpet-bag rule. The Negro was disfranchised for the same reason that the poor white man was disfranchised. It was to prevent any united and organized opposition to the corrupt and lawless practices of the Oligarchy which rules in the South without regard to the rights of the white man or the black man.”\nHe quotes the Alabama Education Commission: “We need not refer to conditions before the war except to repeat that even. as far back as 1840 there were proportionately fewer illiterates among the white population than there are today. The Constitution of 1868, though enacted by a so-called ‘carpet-bag’ government, dealt with the subject of education in a manner far more liberal and infinitely better calculated to promote general intelligence than does either the Constitution of 1875 or that of 1901.” And he places the blame for this as follows: “These delinquencies of the South are not due to poverty, nor to unusual financial burdens of these States; nor are these conditions the result of indifference on the part of the great mass of the people, white or colored. The cause of backwardness is found in the antiquated social and economic systems, the gross inefficiency, mismanagement and corruption of an Oligarchy that desires neither liberty nor enlightenment for the people.”\nAs to crime he says that the “South may be called the nursery of crimes in America. The migratory criminal population of the United States may be traced from the Southern States to every part of the country. The highest record of defalcations and embezzlements is found in those sections of the South where election frauds, and other corrupt practices, have been notorious. In the same communities, peonage has prevailed in the most aggravated form; lynchings, race riots and the most appalling crimes had occurred in those communities where corrupt practices and vice have been most flagrant.”\nAs to lynching he says: “It has been asserted time and time again that the lynching evil in the South was necessary to protect the women of the South. This base, spiteful libel on the Negro has been proclaimed in Congress, in political campaigns, on the lecture platform, written in books and dramatized. For example, in a speech in the city of Boston, in 1919, former Governor Emmett O’Neal of Alabama, said: ‘The lynching evil in the South had its origin in the revolutionary conditions created by Reconstruction.’ The assertion quoted from the former Governor of Alabama has been the rallying shibboleth of the leaders of a provincial and lawless Oligarchy for more than half a century, and it is the most wicked and pernicious slander that ever misled the American people. …”\nFinally, remember that all these statements are backed by page after page of statistics, quotations from official documents and court decisions filling 444 pages of reading matter to which is appended a careful index of 27 pages. A final quotation will give the spirit of the book so far as the black man is concerned: “Racial friction in the Southern States is not the result of economic or moral decline, nor is it due to the vice or lawlessness of the Negro. The Negro in America is not degenerating. He is advancing along all lines that make for a higher and better civilization. Never has there been a race whose leaders, almost without exception, have struggled with more patience and forbearance, or more heroically, than the leaders of the Negroes in the maintenance of peace between two races.”\n\nAmericans who would like to understand the race problem between Englishmen and Indians will read with pleasure “A Passage to India” by E. M. Forster. The first hundred pages or so are a little dull and sometimes affected; then the novel suddenly swings into its stride and becomes a tremendous epic of racial clash held down to earth by honesty and subtle insight such as few novelists ever used. All these people, Dr. Aziz, Miss Quested, Ronny, Fielding, and Professor Godbole, are singularly human. To American Negroes the book is vivid even in its contrasts—the basing of all real racial clash on sex, the policy of insult and humiliation, the hyperbole and unpunctuality of the colored folk, and the close combination of religion, humor and tragedy. We know it all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLight (1912)\nThe Macon Telegraph (1920)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nRadicals (1919)\nThe Newer South (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1924. “Fall Books.” The Crisis 29\n(1): 25. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/29/01/fall_books.html."

    "text": "Fifteen Years\nWith the November number The Crisis began the 15th year of its life. It has weathered doubt and distrust, misrepresentation and throttling, hatred, concealed plot and open bribery. Without recourse to chronicling crime, broadcasting flattery, retailing petty gossip or specializing in slapstick comedy—without cringing to friend or foe, The Crisis has made its way to every state in the nation and every country in the world. All this has drawn bloody sweat, heartache and despair, with all the inspiration of high resolve and unflinching courage.\nNor are we yet out of the woods. This magazine is self-supporting and has been since January 1, 1916. We are proud of this; we often boast of it. And yet what does self-support mean? It means that you spend what you earn and no more. It does not mean that you earn enough to support a proper periodical. You know and we know that our income is not large enough to make this magazine what it should be. It needs increase in size, betterment in appearance, and larger variety in contents; it needs ability to pay more to its contributors and workers and it needs funds for investigation and research.\nIn other words self-support is only a first step. It is a necessary step and a step which few periodicals of the better sort have taken. There is no difficulty in selling to the average public, black and white, sensation, foolishness and gush. But it is desperately difficult to sell information, truth and reform. Some months since there was a meeting of liberal periodicals in New York to compare notes. Of those present, including the Nation, the New Republic and the World Tomorrow, The Crisis alone was self-supporting and our business manager was cheered and made to repeat his report. But after all there was little to brag about; we had cut our pattern to suit our cloth, and a mighty skimpy pattern it was. Yet many folk take The Crisis for granted. They think it is here to stay; that it always can and will fight, expose, commend and investigate. This is not true! No institution like The Crisis can stand still and “occupy” a position. It must move forward or backward.\nIf then you want The Crisis, support it and increase the number of supporters. Remember The Crisis is not trying always to please everybody. That is impossible. But if on the whole this magazine is saying and doing the thing that sensible, educated and far-sighted Negroes want said and done, then make it possible for us to carry our message to a wider audience and tell with redoubled efficiency.\nIf you do not do this, you will not be without magazines and periodicals—O no and never. But they will be the sort that do and say either what foolish and ignorant black folk pay for, or what rich and wise and unscrupulous white folk think is best for us, to keep us in “our place”.\nRemember this, brother, and act. And he acts twice who acts quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe New Crisis (1925)\nForward (1920)\nWe Come of Age (1915)\nTruth and Beauty (1922)\nThirteen (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1924. “Fifteen Years.” The Crisis\n291 (29): 56–57. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/29/02/fifteen_years.html."

They argue that neither race desires intermarriage; that it is a matter “purely social,” and that legalizing the prohibition simply puts stern custom into law. Every now and then, however, there come cases which show the utter blindness of the persons who thus argue and prove that anti-intermarriage laws are simply cloaks for wrong and injustice. In Evansville, Ind., just across the river from Kentucky, Clifford Yarborough, a wealthy white man of Pulaski, Tenn., came into the Circuit Court the other day and asked permission to adopt a seventeen-year-old mulatto girl. The girl might easily pass for white; she is strikingly beautiful and talented in music. Yarborough willingly admitted that the girl’s mother was colored, and that he was the father. He said, “I feel like I should rectify a wrong.” There is no law against intermarriage of races in Indiana, but there is in Tennessee. Judge Givens, therefore, refused to permit the adoption. He said that “if he legitimatized the daughter he would be taking a step which would in practice have the same results as permitting the intermarriage of races.” Therefore let us piously ruin the life of an innocent girl!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nIntermarriage (1927)\nInter-Marriage (1924)\nIntermarriage (1913)\nDecency (1912)\nSex Equality (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Intermarriage.” The Crisis\n11 (6): 306. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/06/intermarriage.html."

It was taken in Lee County, Ga., where on January 20 five were taken from the jail, rushed into the adjoining county in automobiles, hanged and shot. The photograph was taken on the spot and a copy sent to a prominent white man in a neighboring city. His colored servant took it while he was at lunch, handed it to a  Crisis agent, who had it quickly copied. The original was then returned and the copy sent to us. It was a little dim and has been slightly retouched. Otherwise it is absolutely authentic.\nThese men were killed for defending themselves from “arrest.” The arresting mob was led by a sheriff. The sheriff was killed. What was the real cause back of this wholesale lynching and back of the lynching of six Negroes in Early County, December 30th?\nThe answer is clear: Peonage.\nSlavery under another name; the absolute defiance of the spirit of the law of the Thirteenth Amendment.\nThis is perfectly well known. The United States Government once, quite by mistake, ran afoul of it. It was trying to stop the peonage of Italians when its over-zealous prosecuting officer ran across this slavery of Negroes; but after a few desultory prosecutions Mr. Taft succeeded in hushing this up.\nTo understand the situation look at your map of Georgia. Worth, Lee and Early Counties are all in the black belt. These three counties have 18,000 white people and 31,000 colored people. Most of the white people are in the small towns; most of the colored people are in the country. The business of the white people is to make the colored people raise cotton. We quote a southern white man, C. D. Rivers, of Somerville, Va.:\n\nThe Times only the other day carried an account of an overseer in southwest Georgia, named Villipigue, who, with his wife, were the only whites living among a great Negro population on a big plantation. This overseer was killed because he had thrashed a Negro boy for some impudent reply made to the overseer. A mob of whites gathered and armed and a reign of terror was precipitated among the Negroes for miles around. Their secret society halls were burned, a church was burned, cabins were burned and several Negroes shot. Villipigue, the overseer, would not have whipped this boy had he been white. Perhaps had the boy been white his words would not have been considered impudent at all. Again, had Villipigue not been an overseer, charged with making the Negroes produce cotton, there would have been no reason for the altercation, and none would have happened. But sir, these overseers, throughout this vast black belt of cotton plantations are expected to do with the Negroes, to get results from them in the form of cotton produced at the least possible cost, which cannot be got from whites or blacks, except by unrelenting harshness. These overseers are in the position of a lion tamer in a den of lions. To hold their positions and to get the cotton made, they are obliged to use measures which are unknown to the law. Villipigue violated the law when he whipped the Negro boy. Of course, there was no redress for the Negro boy, for who thinks a jury controlled and in sympathy with the black belt plantation interests could dare to punish an overseer for whipping a Negro for impudence? To punish overseers for whipping saucy Negroes’ would amount to turning over the black belt cotton plantations to the Negroes, who would make much less cotton if released from the rule of the overseer. Yes, but it is expecting too much of any sort of human nature to expect that Negroes to whom redress at law is impossible will not avenge themselves for the whipping of their own members, especially their boys.\n\nAnd as much as possible to prevent the Negroes from taking revenge it is absolutely necessary that they should always be kept in mind of swift and terrible penalties which wait not for the slow movements of the law but stand ever ready to strike them. The authority which the overseers and owners of these plantations are obliged to exert over the Negro workers cannot be sustained by the law. There must be extra-legal means always in reach and this extralegal means is the mob, always ready to inflict capital punishment upon Negroes violating that code which arises upon the relations of blacks and whites in the black belt. Consider the immense territory over which these conditions prevail and the immense white population affected by them, and the power and the influence of the interests which are protected by lynch law, and you may see how difficult it is to suppress lynch law.\n\n“The power and the influence of the interests which are protected by lynch law!” There you have the whole modern government of the black belt with the South in its naked nastiness. Small wonder that the President of the United States is “protesting” against the Armenian atrocities of the Turks. We trust that A. Rustem Bey will answer that protest.\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Peonage.” The Crisis. 11(6):302–305.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLynching (1928)\nThe Cause of Lynching (1914)\nLynchings and Mobs (1921)\nLynchings (1932)\nSigns from the South (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Peonage.” The Crisis 11\n(6): 302–5. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/06/peonage.html."

    "text": "This month 200,000 Negro voters will be called upon to vote on the question of giving the right of suffrage to women. The Crisissincerely trusts that everyone of them will vote Yes. But The Crisis would not have them go to the polls without having considered every side of the question. Intelligence in voting is the only real support of democracy. For this reason we publish with pleasure Dean Kelly Miller’s article against woman suffrage. We trust that our readers will give it careful attention and that they will compare it with that marvelous symposium which we had the pleasure to publish in our August number. Meantime, Dean Miller will pardon us for a word in answer to his argument.\nBriefly put, Mr. Miller believes that the bearing and rearing of the young is a function which makes it practically impossible for women to take any large part in general, industrial and public affairs; that women are weaker than men; that women are adequately protected under man’s suffrage; that no adequate results have appeared from woman suffrage and that office-holding by women is “risky.”\nAll these arguments sound today ancient. If we turn to easily available statistics we find that instead of the women of this country or of any other country being confined chiefly to childbearing they are as a matter of fact engaged and engaged successfully in practically every pursuit in which men are engaged. The actual work of the world today depends more largely upon women than upon men. Consequently this man-ruled world faces an astonishing dilemma: either Woman the Worker is doing the world's work successfully or not. If she is not doing it well why do we not take from her the necessity of working? If she is doing it well why not treat her as a worker with a voice in the direction of work?\nThe statement that woman is weaker than man is sheer rot: It is the same sort of thing that we hear about “darker races” and “lower classes.” Difference, either physical or spiritual, does not argue weakness or inferiority. That the average woman is spiritually different from the average man is undoubtedly just as true as the fact that the average white man differs from the average Negro; but this is no reason for disfranchising the Negro or lynching him. It is inconceivable that any person looking upon the accomplishments of women today in every field of endeavor, realizing their humiliating handicap and the astonishing prejudices which they face and yet seeing despite this that in government, in the professions, in sciences, art and literature and the industries they are leading and dominating forces and growing in power as their emancipation grows,—it is inconceivable that any fair-minded person could for a moment talk about a “weaker” sex. The sex of Judith, Candace, Queen Elizabeth, Sojourner Truth and Jane Addams was the merest incident of human function and not a mark of weakness and inferiority.\nTo say that men protect women with their votes is to overlook the flat testimony of the facts. In the first place there are millions of women who have no natural men protectors: the unmarried, the widowed, the deserted and those who have married failures. To put this whole army incontinently out of court and leave them unprotected and without voice in political life is more than unjust, it is a crime.\nThere was a day in the world when it was considered that by marriage a woman lost all her individuality as a human soul and simply became a machine for making men. We have out-grown that idea. A woman is just as much a thinking, feeling, acting person after marriage as before. She has opinions and she has a right to have them and she has a right to express them. It is conceivable, of course, for a country to decide that its unit of representation should be the family and that one person in that family should express its will. But by what possible process of rational thought can it be decided that the person to express that will should always be the male, whether he be genius or drunkard, imbecile or captain of industry? The meaning of the twentieth century is the freeing of the individual soul; the soul longest in slavery and still in the most disgusting and indefensible slavery is the soul of womanhood. God give her increased freedom this November!\nMr. Miller is right in saying that the results from woman suffrage have as yet been small but the answer is obvious: the experiment has been small. As for the risks of allowing women to hold office: Are they nearly as great as the risks of allowing working men to hold office loomed once in the eyes of the Intelligent Fearful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVotes for Women (1918)\nThe Risk of Woman Suffrage (1915)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nVotes for Women (1912)\nWoman’s Suffrage (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “Woman Suffrage.” The Crisis\n11 (1): 29–30. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/01/woman_suffrage.html."

    "text": "The August number of The Crisis contained an interesting symposium on woman suffrage. The symposium was unusual, in that it involved only one side of a disputed issue. The contributors represent some of the ablest and most thoughtful names among us. They presented, presumably, the best possible putting of the cause espoused. The public, however, should not be misled to suppose that they represent the general attitude of the colored race on that question. Despite the ardent advocacy and plausible pleas of the propagandists, I am wholly unable to see wherein the experiment of woman suffrage promises any genuine advantage to social wellbeing.\nThe human race is divided horizontally by age, vertically by sex and diagonally by race. Each individual passes from the minor to the adult stage in course of a life time; the cleavage of race is subject to indefinite modification through environment and intermingling of blood; but sex is the one fixed and unalterable separatrix of mankind. The function of sex in human economy is clearly defined and well understood. The bearing and rearing of the young constitute the chief duty and responsibility of the female, and this task absorbs her highest energies during the most energetic period of her life. The family constitutes the fundamental social unit. Woman’s sphere of activity falls mainly within while man’s field of action lies largely without the domestic circle. This represents the traditional and, presumably, the ideal relation between the sexes. It has the sanction of divine authority and the test of human experience. Woman suffrage could not possibly enhance the harmoniousness of this relationship, but might seriously jeopardize it.\nWoman is physically weaker than man and is incapable of competing with him in the stern and strenuous activities of public and practical life. In the final analysis, politics is a game of force, in which no weakling may expect to be assigned a conspicuous role.\nAs part of her equipment for motherhood, woman has been endowed with finer feelings and a more highly emotional nature than man. She shows tender devotion and self sacrifice for those close to her by ties of blood or bonds of endearment. But by the universal law of compensation, she loses in extension what is gained in intensity. She lacks the sharp sense of public justice and the common good, if they seem to run counter to her personal feeling and interest. She is far superior to man in purely personal and private virtue, but is his inferior in public qualities and character. Suffrage is not a natural right, like life and liberty. The common sense of mankind has always limited it by age, sex, possession, attainment and moral character. It is merely a convenient agency through which to secure the best result of government, and to make secure life, liberty and happiness to all. It cannot be maintained that woman is deprived of any of these objects under male suffrage. It is inconceivable that man would legislate against his wife and daughter, who are dearer to him than life itself, and who, he knows, must fall back upon his strong arm for protection, whether they be given the suffrage or not.\nThe historical hardships and legal disabilities against which women complain so bitterly were incidental imperfections of social development. Most of these have already been swept away, as all of them are bound to be, by man’s growing sense of justice and fair play.\nFemale suffrage has been tried in twelve states of the Union, but so far no genuine public benefit has resulted therefrom, nor has the lot of woman been ameliorated more rapidly than in other states under exclusive male suffrage.\nThere may be some argument for suffrage for unfortunate females, such as widows and hopeless spinsters, but such status is not contemplated as a normal social relation.\nWomen as voters would undoubtedly stand against the purely masculine vices such as drunkenness and the social evil, but they can be equally or even more efficacious through non-political influence.\nThe logical sequence of suffrage is office-holding. Female suffrage will never reach its full fruition until fully one-half of all public offices, legislative, judicial and executive, local and national, are filled by women. Is the public mind ready for this risky innovation?\nIt is alleged that Negro suffrage and woman suffrage rest on the same basis. But on close analysis it is found that there is scarcely any common ground between them. The female sex does not form a class separate and distinct from the male sex in the sense that the Negro forms a class separate and distinct from the whites. Experience and reason both alike show that no race is good enough to govern another without that other’s consent. On the other hand both experience and reason demonstrate that the male seeks the welfare and happiness of the female even above his own interest. The Negro can not get justice or fair treatment without the suffrage. Woman can make no such claim, for man accords her not only every privilege which he himself enjoys but the additional privilege of protection.\nThe fundamental defect in the propaganda of woman suffrage consists in the fact that instead of confining its effort to the improvement of woman’s lot along the line of her obvious sphere and function in the social scheme, it insists upon her privilege and opportunities being artificially identical with those of man. It is amusing to note that women are to be allowed to vote at twenty-one merely because men are accorded the privilege at that age; whereas according to their physical and mental developments, the sexes have a different order of maturity. If the strictly physiological and psychological basis of male suffrage is placed at twenty-one, female suffrage should be placed at eighteen. If man should be allowed to vote on the first appearance of a mustache, some woman would doubtless demand the same privilege.\nMale and female created He them; what God has made different man strives in vain to make identical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nWoman’s Suffrage (1913)\nVotes for Women (1912)\nSuffrage and Women (1915)\nThe Justice of Woman Suffrage (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nKelly, Miller. 1915. “The Risk of Woman Suffrage.”\nThe Crisis 11 (1): 37–38. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/01/risk_of_woman_suffrage.html."

His fame was international and his influence far-reaching. Of the good that he accomplished there can be no doubt: he directed the attention of the Negro race in America to the pressing necessity of economic development; he emphasized technical education and he did much to pave the way for an understanding between the white and darker races.\nOn the other hand there can be no doubt of Mr. Washington’s mistakes and short comings: he never adequately grasped the growing bond of politics and industry; he did not understand the deeper foundations of human training and his basis of better understanding between white and black was founded on caste.\nWe may then generously and with deep earnestness lay on the grave of Booker T. Washington testimony of our thankfulness for his undoubted help in the accumulation of Negro land and property, his establishment of Tuskegee and spreading of industrial education and his compelling of the white south to at least think of the Negro as a possible man.\nOn the other hand, in stern justice, we must lay on the soul of this man, a heavy responsibility for the consummation of Negro disfranchisement, the decline of the Negro college and public school and the firmer establishment of color caste in this land.\nWhat is done is done. This is no fit time for recrimination or complaint. Gravely and with bowed head let us receive what this great figure gave of good, silently rejecting all else. Firmly and unfalteringly let the Negro race in America, in bleeding Hayti and throughout the world close ranks and march steadily on, determined as never before to work and_ save and endure, but never to swerve from their great goal: the right to vote, the right to know, and the right to stand as men among men throughout the world.\nIt is rumored that Mr. Washington’s successor at Tuskegee will be Robert Russa Moton, Commandant of Cadets at Hampton. If this proves true Major Moton will enter on his new duties with the sympathy and good will of his many friends both black and white.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSocial Equality (1916)\nThe President (1915)\nWilliam Monroe Trotter (1914)\nMr. Taft (1911)\nAn Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “Booker T.

    "text": "I wrote it four years ago. I called it, or rather it called itself by various names. Finally it decided to be called “The Star of Ethiopia.” I acquiesced. My friends looked upon it with lack-luster eye. I did not blame them. The more I read it myself the more it seemed wanting: And yet as I turned over my rejected manuscripts this always bobbed up with a certain insistance, a kind of “Why not try me” tone. Its first resurrection came in 1913 when we were celebrating, in New York, Emancipation.\nWhat a task that was! I have been through a good many laborious jobs and had to bear on many occasions accusations difficult to rest under, but without doubt the New York Emancipation Exposition was the worst of all my experiences. Such an avalanche of altogether unmerited and absurd attacks it had never been my fortune to experience. Yet through it all one thing became clearer—the Pageant must be tried. We must attempt, at least, this one new thing in the dead level of uninteresting exhibitions. We had our ups and downs with it. It was difficult to get hold of the people; it was more difficult to keep them. There were curious little wranglings and bickerings and none of us will forget that dress rehearsal. If there had been any reasonably convenient method of escape the Pageant would never have seen the light of day.\nAnd then it came—four exhibitions, singular in their striking beauty, and above all in the grip they took upon men. Literally, thousands besieged our doors and the sight of the thing continually made the tears arise. After these audiences aggregating 14,000, I said: the Pageant is the thing. This is what the people want and long for. This is the gown and paraphernalia in which the message of education and reasonable race pride can deck itself. And yet a year went by and another year. I had upon me somehow the fear of doing. When one has done a thing and done it fairly well it seems like tempting fate to try it again. And then, after all, there was no money. There was war and there was trouble. So another year passed, and then with a start I felt that I was letting something go that was really worth while—letting it die because of certain moral cowardice and so I girded myself and looked around the world and hit upon Washington at once the most promising and the most difficult of places; the largest Negro city in the northern hemisphere and yet for that very reason exceedingly hard to reach and interest with a new and untried thing.\nThe few that came out to the preliminary meetings listened with interest. They even showed enthusiasm at times and they promised cooperation and they kept their word. I had the whole matter carefully planned but I early found that the best laid plans needed a curious personal joining together on the part of the one who has the vision of what he wants and cannot adequately tell it.\nI remember that Friday when I opened the office. The beautiful sign which Richard Brown had painted was going up and I was helping boost it. A good friend came by and looked at me. There was pity way down in his soul. “Are you still encouraged?” he asked. His question was a revelation. The whole city doubted. A thousand actors, gowned and trained in three weeks? “Impossible!” said the city. Nevertheless they worked loyally.\nMy helpers came to town on the dot. Mr. Burroughs, with his deliberate genius and unwavering faith; Mrs. Norman with her great mastery of men—or rather of women—and Mrs. Curtis who came almost concealed under thousands of yards of cloth. Already in the field was the tireless Mrs. Glenn and eventually came Mr. Davidson. Richard Brown had long been working. So we started and our troubles started with us.\nThe School Board was slow but when it moved it moved generously. The rehearsals hitched and for interminable days we had a hundred people where we needed a thousand. The music went awry and it seemed an absolutely impossible task properly to advertise the thing we were doing and get the mass of the people to know and to think about it. And then the weather—oh! the weather! The pains of hell gat hold upon me and the terrors of the damned during that week of cold, drizzly weather that preceded the week of our entertainment. I was at the very nadir of my faith, and wondered rather helplessly why it was I could never let well enough alone, but was always pushing out into some frontier of wilderness endeavoring to do the impossible. Then (by what miracle who knows), came three nights, each more perfect than the other and sandwiched in between rains. Some said God did it and I am not disposed to dispute.\nBut the money. The way the funds rained through my fingers was quite unbelievable. I saw ahead of me the most shocking bankruptcy, the most unbelievable extravagance. Everything seemed to be costing just twice as much as it should. Final hitches came on the very end of our endeavor. The music looked dubious; the regulations of the ball field seemed about to interfere with even our walking firmly on tha grass; the electric lighting got into inextricable tangles. The tickets were late. The costumes were later and the properties latest of all. New expenses kept cropping up, and finally, when the ciyy inspector dropped around very late one evening and casually remarked that he might have to hold up the whole thing because a few red lights were missing, it seemed as though the cup of misfortune was full.\nThen it was as it always is in things of this sort. Suddenly a great new spirit seemed born. The Thing that you have exorcized becomes a living, mighty, moving spirit. It sweeps on and you hang trembling to its skirts. Nothing can stop it. It is. It will. Wonderfully, irresistably the dream comes true. You feel no exaltation, you feel no personal merit. It is not yours. It is its own. You have simply called it, and it comes.\nI shall never forget that last night. Six thousand human faces looked down from the shifting blaze of lights and on the field the shimmering streams of colors came and went, silently, miraculously save for the great cloud of music that hovered over them and enveloped them. It was no mere picture: it was reality.\nThe Herald cried, “People of Washington arise, and go. The Play is done.” And yet the play was not done. Some things are quite too beautiful ever to be finished. So I walked home alone and the joys of God.\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “The Star of Ethiopia.” The Crisis. 11(2):91–93.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nToward a New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nNegro Writers (1920)\nThe Name Negro (1928)\nA Crusade (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “The Star of Ethiopia.”\nThe Crisis 11 (2): 91–93. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/02/star_of_ethiopia.html."

    "text": "In the presence of a world gone stark mad it seems of little use to talk of anything but war. Yet we wonder if a voice out of the South may not possibly call our war-mad President back to the kind of preparedness that some of us expected of him when he took the presidential chair.\nThe University Commission of Southern Race Problems sends a letter to college men about the horror of lynching. Surely President Wilson has read these paragraphs from a letter signed by white college professors in eleven Southern states:\n\nThese are the terrible facts. Is there no remedy? Have we not sufficient legal intelligence and machinery to take care of every case of crime committed? Must we fall back on the methods of the jungle? Civilization rests on the obedience to law, which means the substitution of reason and deliberation for impulse, instinct and passion. It is easy and tempting to obey the latter, but to be governed by the former requires self-control, which comes from the interposition of thought between impulse and action. Herein lies the college man’s opportunity to serve his fellows; to interpose deliberation between their impulses and action, and in that way to control both.\n \nSociety has a right to expect college men to help in moulding opinion and shaping conduct in matters of this sort. It is their privilege and duty to co-operate with others in leading crusades against crime and mob rule and for law and civilization. The college man belongs in the front rank of those fighting for moral and social progress. For this reason the University Commission makes its first appeal to you and urges you strongly to co-operate with the press, the pulpit, the bar, officers of the law and all other agencies striving to eliminate this great evil, by speaking out boldly when speech is needed and letting your influence be felt against it in decided, unmistakable measure and manner.\n\nIs there any “preparedness” for Christianity, for human culture, for peace or even for war, that is more pressing than the abolition of lynching in the United States? Alas! We have little hope of reaching the ears of the President.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cherokee County, Georgia, suffered four incendiary fires during the twenty-four hours commencing at one-thirty on the morning of Sunday, December 5, 1915. At that hour two barns belonging to Gus Coggins, on the outskirts of Canton, the county seat, were set on fire. Mr. Coggins is one of the largest stock dealers in the South. In one barn 159 mules and two horses perished; in the other 16,000 bushels of corn, many tons of hay, seven carloads of cottonseed hulls, and a car and a half of cottonseed meal, together with farming implements of every description, were consumed. Out of the largest corn crop ever produced in north Georgia and the greatest number of stock gathered under one roof, nothing was saved but Coggins’ celebrated racer, Sledmer.\nAt almost the same hour, a tenant house belonging to W. F. Bell, five miles east of Canton, which had been vacated by a Negro tenant named Parks Bates the Wednesday previous, was burned. Bates had for some reason departed too suddenly to take with him his household goods, which were burned with the building. In a split board placed in a wire fence nearby were three matches covered with a printed card bearing the inscription “move rapidly.”\nAbout one o’clock Monday morning the residence and barn of Otto Sherman, one-half mile east of Hickory Flat, were set on fire and totally consumed. Housed in the barn were eight fine mules. Mr. Sherman was in south Georgia at the time. When neighbors reached the fire and liberated the animals it was discovered that “plugs” had been substituted for the Sherman mules and the good stock run off.\nWithin a few minutes after the Sherman fire, the torch was applied to the residence and barn of Guy Stringer who lives only a short distance from Sherman. Besides his crops and household effects, seven head of live stock perished in the Stringer blaze. Two old plugs were rescued from the burning barn which did not belong to Stringer.\nThe Governor of Georgia immediately issued a proclamation offering $250 reward.\nThe insurance companies sent in detectives to work on the theory that the owners of the barns near Hickory Flat set them afire to get the insurance. The finding of six of the mules by the sheriff, abandoned in a pasture up in Pickens County, led some to believe that the fires were but a blind to cover plain horse stealing. The belief held by the average man one talks to, however, carries directly back to the anti-Negro “pogrom” of 1912 in Forsyth County.\nForsyth County is a sparsely settled Piedmont section wherein scattered hardwoods alternate with fields of cotton and corn. At the time of the Terror the population was 12,000, of whom 2,000 were colored. No railroad touches the county, nor the counties to the north. The region is in all respects backward, but decidedly the most backward thing in the county was the cracker who came into direct competition with the Negro. These two classes were alike either tenants of the larger landholders, day laborers, or one-mule farmers of their own land. White and colored were paid alike from $.75 to $1 a day, but no one would hire a cracker for farm labor or teaming when he could get a Negro. The colored people, too, had a monopoly of the household positions, and the independent Negro farmers had established credit with the bank and the stores to a much larger degree than the crackers. This third class of small capitalists unanimously testifies that Forsyth County for the most part had an industrious, law-abiding, reliable lot of “niggers.”\nThree of them, however, in the neighborhood of Brown’s bridge in eastern Forsyth, raped a white girl named Crow on a Sunday in October, 1912. They had her during one night and a part of the next day. At the end of the orgy they beat her on the head with a rock and left her for dead in the woods covered with boughs, although as a matter of fact she lived for two weeks after and died of pneumonia rather than of her wounds.\nThe sheriff from Cumming brought in one particularly “sorry nigger” that public opinion adjudged guilty, together with several suspects. Those of the Brown’s bridge neighborhood who escaped arrest began to find themselves in limp heaps of two or three along the roadside.\nCumming, the county seat, with its population of 300, is built around the four sides of Court House Square. On one corner are the bank and the hotel; diagonally opposite is the lock-up, a red brick, one-story box about thirty feet square. On Wednesday (October 17) the mob went to the house of the sheriff and demanded the keys. He told them they would have to find them, and they proceeded to search his house, without success. So they procured a sledge, led aside the deputy who was on duty in front of the jail, and smashed in the locks and the Negro’s skull with a hammer. With a pair of new harness reins taken from the buggy of the rural mail carrier they dragged the Negro around Court House Square by the heels, and hanged him to the cross-arm of the telegraph pole in front of the bank. There was just a quiver of life in the body when they strung him up at three o’clock in the afternoon.\nA colored teamster driving his mules around the corner into the square, seeing that symbol dangling in front of the most respectable institution in the county, quit his wagon and ran.\n“Let’s run ’em all out,” the wielder of the hammer suggested.\nBy the time they cut the body down at sunset the exodus from Forsyth County had commenced.\n“Those of us who should have known better,” a well-to-do Cumming merchant told me, standing there in that peaceful backwoods market place, “looked on and said the niggers deserved to be killed. We didn’t mean it, and we didn’t foresee the consequences. But that low-down gang took it as literally as they do the advice of Tom Watson.”\nThey started in to rid Forsyth County of the last one of those two thousand colored people. A Negro would receive an anonymous letter giving him twenty-four, thirty-six hours, occasionally ten days to quit the county. That meant in some cases precipitate flight and the abandonment of everything owned in the world. In other cases it meant a sale at a few days’ notice, at which a cow worth $25 would bring $8–9, and hogs worth $15–20 sold for $4–6. House and land brought nothing. If the Negro owned a mule he moved out his furniture, otherwise it was burned after his departure. Failure to vacate on the date set meant a stealthy visit in the night and either dynamite or the torch. The result was a state of terror which caused one Negro family to accept a twenty-four hour notice from two children aged five and six respectively who had learned the game from their elders. At the hotel in Cumming the owner kept one servant on until January after repeated notices, but let her go then for fear of inability longer to protect the servant’s life. A genial, poverty-stricken white farmer named Bagwell described the final incident:\n“Old man Roper yonder had a nigger he well nigh couldn’t live without, knew every stone and stump on the farm. The boys warned him time and again to get shet of him, but Roper would keep him on. So one night they jest had to put a stick of dynamite under the nigger’s house. Blew him clean through the roof. No, it didn’t kill him, but it started him for Hall County right smart. … I reckon they won’t be back; you see the young fellers are growing up sort of with the idea that this is a white man’s county.”\nThe return to law and order in Forsyth County was celebrated by a triumph as impressive as the spectacle of the 17th October. Two Negroes who were in jail on that date as witnesses of the raping were taken to Atlanta by an escort of militia, returned to Cumming guarded by the troops, and were convicted on the testimony of the sister of one of the men who turned State’s evidence and swore to holding a lantern while her brother ravished the Crow girl. (She was shot shortly after the trial.) A hundred and fifty militiamen were brought in for the hanging to see that the convicts arrived at the scaffold alive. In exchange for the lumber used to construct the blinds about the scaffold, a Cumming doctor offered the use of his pasture on the edge of the town for the execution. The night before, however, he was cheated of his reward by the gang which burned down the blinds. The following day, by actual count, over 10,000 citizens of the State parked their Fords and tethered their mules in the doctor’s pasture to witness the formal dedication of Forsyth County, Ga., to the white race.\nThe county to the north of Forsyth, Dawson, produces nothing in the northern parts but timber and “blockade” whisky. In the southeastern corner, however, along the Etowah River from Palmour to the county line, are exceedingly rich alluvial flats. The corn of this region requires field labor, and in this rich section had settled what Negroes there were in Dawson County, about a hundred all told. According to “Colonel” A. W. Vandiviere, a lawyer at the county seat who was for years the county school commissioner, there was a maximum of forty children enrolled at the colored school under one of the graduates of Morehouse College. Eighteen of the men were registered voters, and they paid taxes on about $5,000 worth of property, most of the number being tenants. He says they were an unusually industrious, responsible group, none of whom had ever been accused of any such crime as that committed in Forsyth County.\nNevertheless, a gang of about a dozen crackers, with one John Jackson as the leading spirit (according to Col. Vandiviere) took advantage of the situation in the next county and began serving notice on the Negroes in Dawson. As they had nothing against them excepting their color and competition, however, they did give them generally two weeks in which to leave. As in Forsyth County, the night-riders were poverty-stricken, cowardly crackers who hoped by driving the Negroes out to be able to rent whatever land they desired, and to command their own price for labor. Not one in the gang, according to Robert A. Gober, paid over $2 a year taxes.\nThis Robert Gober is the strong man of Dawson County. He is postmaster at Dougherty, the center of the Etowah Valley district, owns the only store and gristmill in the region, is a large landholder, and had over $5,000 at stake in provisions advanced and money loaned to colored men on ungathered crops in the two counties when the trouble started. It should be stated equally distinctly that he is a big-boned, big-hearted mountaineer with a rudimentary sense of justice and five well educated sons to his credit. He is the one man in the two counties who had the courage to fight.\nMr. Gober told his colored tenants and laborers that he would protect them as long as they would stay. From Gainesville he sent one of the Hall County officials down to Atlanta to try and get help from the Federal Government.\n“If we could have gotten a few detectives sent in here right at the start and obtained the evidence to convict one or two of them, the rest would have been frightened out,” he believes.\nFailing to get help from outside, he went to the life insurance agent, told the company exactly what he proposed to do, and persuaded them to take him as a special risk for five years. Night after night for months, while the colored women and children fled to the woods, afraid even to light a fire, he slept with loaded guns handy in the hope of detaining some tangible evidence when they came to blow up his tenants’ houses or burn down his store.\nA neighbor who followed his example in paying no heed to the warnings to “get shet of your niggers,’ heard a fusillade a hundred yards up the road one dark night, and then, as the Negroes fled, saw the flames licking up the sides of their quarters. The gang threw a couple of dogs and a shote into the flames to show their courage and disappeared into the dark. Mr. Gober was unable to keep any of his colored people after this incident except Homer Palmer.\n“Homer was a nigger that was always ready to do anything I asked of him day or night,” Mr. Gober says. “I would send him to the bank at Gainesville with $500 just as quick as I would my son—he’d a fit for that money. When my son was dying of pneumonia, Homer jumped on a mule in the worst blizzard we ever had in these parts and rode twenty-five miles for the doctor and twenty-five miles back. We had to pry his fingers open to get the reins out of his hands when he rode into that yard in the middle of the night—clothes frozen stiff. That nigger saved my son’s life, and I’d be fighting for him yet if he’d a stayed on.”\nHomer did stay until the March after the Forsyth lynching, through five months of terror. After the burning at the Roland place he sent his family out. Each night Mr. Gober came over to Homer’s little shack on the other side of the river and the two waited, armed with two rifles and four double-barreled shot-guns, for the nightriders to blow them up. In March, however, the strain and the separation from his people, the knowledge that he was the only colored man in two counties drove Homer out, and Dawson County was as white as Forsyth.\nWhat of the counties into which the Negroes were driven? Railroads cross both Cherokee County to the west and Gwinnett and Hall Counties to the east, giving a somewhat different complexion to society. Big capital is invested and dominates the local governments. At Ball Ground and Canton in Cherokee County are large marble finishing works, and the cotton mill at Canton employes between four and five hundred hands. Gainesville, the county seat of Hall County, is a town of 6,000. The modern industrial conditions in towns like these need an abundant supply of cheap labor.\nWhen the crackers in Hall County started to pass the Forsyth fugitives along and make a sweep of their own county at the same time, the word went out, according to local gossip, to spend ten thousand dollars if necessary to crush the thing in its infancy. Hall County realized that it couldn’t afford to let the poor whites meddle with its colored labor supply. Eleven arrests were made within twenty-four hours after the terrorization started, and it subsided in a few days.\nIn Cherokee County the crackers did succeed in driving out several of the “sorriest” Negro families, but public sentiment wouldn’t stand for interference with the others.\nThe crackers who drove the Negroes out of Forsyth and Dawson Counties boasted that they would rent any land they wanted after that, and that they would get anything they asked for their labor. They had driven out 2,100 competitors out of a population of 13,000. So secure they felt in their monopoly of the labor market of the counties that white women in Cumming are reported to have demanded $2.50 a day for their services when asked to do the cooking and washing that had previously been done by colored women. Mrs. Gober complains that the only white woman who would come to work for her under any conditions insisted that wood and water be brought in for her, although the well is but five or six feet from the kitchen door. The men were equally prone to be dictatorial in laying down the conditions under which they would work. A dealer in fertilizer who had kept six teams with Negro drivers hauling all the time told me the crackers were so shiftless and so touchy that he couldn’t work them.\nThe result with the last named gentleman was that he sold his mules and quit that part of his business rather than try to run it with white labor.\n“What’s more, I get up before daylight on Monday mornings and do our washing myself now. They drove out a cook who had raised seventeen children out of my kitchen,” he said with some remarks about the class of whites who had brought him to that pass which will not bear repeating.\nHis is a fairly typical case. In every family in the two counties the wives are doing their own housework. The hotel in Cumming is the only place I heard of which boasts a white house servant, whereas formerly every considerable landholder and the merchant class in town all kept a colored menial. It would be difficult to strike a community in a more vital spot.\nThe small capitalist class hit below the belt by the driving out of their servants retaliated on the active instigators of the “pogrom” by refusing them all credit at their stores, by refusing to rent an acre of land to them, and by declining to hire them as day laborers. Mr. Gober said that this policy has literally starved out all but one or two of the dozen men who constituted themselves the vigilance committee in Dawson County; some have gone into neighboring counties, one or two have migrated to Texas. Col. Vandiviere said he had declined to recommend a man for a job just recently because it was rumored he had participated in the Negro baiting.\nThe bleaching of Forsyth and Dawson, so far as I could ascertain, has in no respect benefited the poor whites who drove the Negroes out.\nIf the crackers gained nothing but the distinction of living in a “white man’s country,” the counties have lost certain definite items of material prosperity. First and most important is their credit in the money market. A Dawson County farmer who recently refused $12,000 for his farm, went during the month of December to Atlanta to take out a $2,000 mortgage on his place. Atlanta bankers told him his property was all right except its location—they didn’t care to do business in such lawless parts. The cashier of the bank at Cumming corroborated that story and stated frankly that Forsyth County has no credit with the outside world. Secondly, the farmers with Negro tenants lost a very large part of the cotton crop the year of the exodus because they could get no one to pick it. Mr. Gober told me he lost over $5,000 in money and supplies advanced to Negroes against the crops they were prevented from gathering, and other landholders of course lost accordingly. Thirdly, the district is still losing to the extent that land owned by Negroes who have been unable to sell at any figure lies idle, growing up to weeds as their empty cabins decay. This last is of course an insignificant item in the counties’ resources. And finally, they feel the judgment of the commercial world in the increased insurance rates which are demanded. In Cherokee County, since the fires of last month, the editor of the Cherokee Advance stated, the insurance companies have refused to issue policies on any terms.\nIt is now easy to understand the explanation for the Cherokee County fires of December 5 which is currently accepted in both Forsyth and Cherokee Counties by the average man one talks with. Gus Coggins is one of the largest employers of Negro labor in the county, having taken on several of the Forsyth fugitives. Sherman and Stringer both employed Forsyth Negroes, and both have stated that they received warning to get rid of their colored help. Parks Bates and one other Negro who thought it time to move again were fugitives from across the Forsyth line. It looks decidedly as though the crackers thought it a good time to kill two birds with one stone by driving out the Negroes with fire while running off some valuable mules under cover of the confusion.\nThe proceedings of the Circuit Court which opens in Canton on February 1, may show the fires to have had no connection with Negro baiting but the general opinion is that they marked the beginning of an effort to drive the Negroes from Cherokee which died after twenty-four hours when the gang saw that the Governor and the sheriff intended to get them if possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nDalton, GA (1932)\nThe Burning of Jim Mc Ilherron: An N.A.A.C.P.

    "title": "The Negro Public School",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A phrase in the December Crisis has led to some inquiry as to what we mean by the “decline” of the Negro public school. Perhaps our meaning can best be illustrated by two or three references. The Christian Herald, for instance, says: “It was early recognized by those responsible for the education of the Negro that an education which would fit him to associate with the whites on equal terms was an education which would only disappoint him and which would leave him unfitted for anything. The main effort, therefore, was put upon the development of schools that should give to the Negro an education that would fit him for the occupations and manner of living which he could expect to follow. This meant vocational training.”\nTo this we may add the information from the Charleston (S.C.) News and Courier that in Rock Hill has been established a school “for Negro servants” and that the public schools of the town are being used to co-operate in this work. This we maintain points to the decline of Negro schools and it indicates a widespread movement. Whenever a public school system is used not for disseminating intelligence and giving the keys of knowledge, but rather for the establishment of caste, then the school is missing its purpose. It may well be that at a particular time and a particular place the caste feeling is so strong, the race hatred so potent, that the only school possible is a school which will keep the hated in their places; but manifestly under such circumstances there is not only room for but crying need for a propaganda to attack caste; to say that it is not right to build up a public school system in order to furnish menials for the rich. In the schools of no other group in the nation beside Negroes have persons dared to enunciate such an object for the public schools, no matter how much they may have thought it. If we would build real democracy in the United States we must make such daring impossible in the case of Negroes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEmployment (1932)\nEducation (1911)\nSchools (1917)\nPublic Schools (1916)\nPublic Schools (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “The Negro Public School.”\nThe Crisis 11 (5): 244. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/05/negro_public_school.html."

We do not for a moment pretend that the German people are ogres and the Allies saints, but we confess that based on unchallenged records there can be no doubt that Germany’s attitude toward colored races is indefensible.\nLewis R. Freeman says in the World’s Work:\n\nIn Damaraland between the years 1904 and 1907 as the consequence of the killing of a single child the Germans wantonly did to death 30,000 Hereros, a simple pastoral tribe of scant fighting capacity. Never since Nero and Attila had there been a parallel to Von Trotha’s infamous order of extermination.\n  ‘Within German borders’ read the proclamation of this Teutonic barbarian ‘every Herero with or without rifle, with or without cattle will be shot. I will take no more women or children. I will drive them back or have them fired on.’\n  For several years Germany seemed actually to be trying to make Damaraland a ‘white man’s country’ by killing the blacks. It has reaped in failure the logical harvest of this sowing of brutality.\n\nOn the other hand the New York Nation has an article that tells us of the peculiar affection of the colored races for France:\n\nThe brilliant success of the French in handling such soldiers is largely due to something entirely wanting to Germans in their dealings with subordinate races. It is something which even the Englishman’s fair play does not altogether supply. It is the hand-to-hand comradeship of officers and men.\n\nSmall wonder that a black and wounded Senegalese writes from the hospital:\n\nNext spring we blacks will give our lives again and show we are worthy to fight beside our white brothers for the defense of France. If I have been able to be somebody in my country, it is owing to the lessons of my French masters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWorld War and the Color Line (1914)\nClose Ranks (1918)\nJust Like—Folks (1920)\nDecency (1912)\nPan-Africa and New Racial Philosophy (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Germany.” The Crisis 11\n(4): 186–87. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/04/germany.html."

The monkey sentinel cried and his fellows dashed down the great tree avenues. The way was marked—yonder the leopard that called last night under the moon, a bush cow’s hoof; a dainty tread of antelope. We leaped the trail of driver ants and poked at the great houses of the white ants. The path rose and wound and fell now soft in green glow, now golden, now shimmery through the water as we balanced on a bare log. There was whine of monkey, scramble of timid unseen life, glide of dark snake. Then came the native farms—coffee, cocoa, plantain, cassava. Nothing is more beautiful than an African village—its harmonious colorings—its cleanliness, its dainty houses with the kitchen palaver place of entertainment, its careful delicate decorations and then the people. I believe that the African form in color and curve is the beautifulest thing on earth; the face is not so lovely—though often comely with perfect teeth and shining eyes,—but the form of the slim limbs, the muscled torso, the deep full breasts!\nThe bush is silence. Silence of things to be, silence vocal with infinite minor music and flutter and tremble—but silence, deep silence of the great void of Africa.\nAnd the palms; some rose and flared like green fine work; some flared before they rose; some soared and drooped; some were stars and some were sentinels; then came the ferns—the feathery delicate things of grottos and haunts with us, leapt and sang in the sun—they thrust their virgin tracery up and out and almost to trees. Bizarre shapes of grass and shrub and leaf greeted us as though some artist all Divine was playing and laughing and trying every trick of his bewitched pencil above the mighty buildings of the ants.\nI am riding on the singing heads of black boys swinging in a hammock. The smooth black bodies swing and sing, the neck set square, the hips sway. O lovely voices and sweet young souls of Africa!"

    "text": "I\n\nThere have been times when we writers of the older set have been afraid that the procession of those who seek to express the life of the American Negro was thinning and that none were coming forward to fill the footsteps of the fathers. Dunbar is dead; Chesnutt is silent; and Kelly Miller is mooning after false gods while Brawley and Woodson are writing history rather than literature. But even as we ask “Where are the young Negro artists to mold and weld this mighty material about us?”—even as we ask, they come.\nThere are two books before me, which, if I mistake not, will mark an epoch: a novel by Jessie Fauset and a book of stories and poems by Jean Toomer. There are besides these, five poets writing: Langston Hughes, Countée Cullen, Georgia Johnson, Gwendolyn Bennett and Claude McKay. Finally, Negro men are appearing as essayists and reviewers, like Walter White and Eric Walrond. (And even as I write comes the news that a novel by Mr. White has just found a publisher.) Here then is promise sufficient to attract us.\nWe recognize the exquisite abandon of a new day in Langston Hughes’ “Song For a Banjo.” He sings:\n\n\nShake your brown feet, Liza,\n\nShake ’em Liza, chile,\n\nShake your brown feet, Liza,\n\n(The music’s soft and wile).\n\nShake your brown feet, Liza,\n\n(The Banjo’s sobbin’ low),\n\nThe sun’s goin’ down this very night—\n\nMight never rise no mo’.\n\nCountée Cullen in his “Ballad of the Brown Girl” achieves eight lyric lines that are as true as life itself. There is in Claude McKay’s “If We Must Die” a strain martial and mutinous. There are other echoes—two from dead poets Jamison and Cotter who achieved in their young years long life if not immortality. But this essay is of two books.\nThe world of black folk will some day arise and point to Jean Toomer as a writer who first dared to emancipate the colored world from the conventions of sex. It is quite impossible for most Americans to realize how straight-laced and conventional thought is within the Negro World, despite the very unconventional acts of the group. Yet this contradiction is true. And Jean Toomer is the first of our writers to hurl his pen across the very face of our sex conventionality. In “Cane” (Boni & Liveright, New York), one has only to take his women characters seriatim to realize this: Here is Karintha, an innocent prostitute; Becky, a fallen white woman; Carma, a tender Amazon of unbridled desire; Fern, an unconscious wanton; Esther, a woman who looks age and bastardy in the face and flees in despair; Louise, with a white and a black lover; Avey, unfeeling and unmoral; and Doris, the cheap chorus girl. These are his women, painted with a frankness that is going to make his black readers shrink and criticize; and yet they are done with a certain splendid, careless truth.\nToomer does not impress me as one who knows his Georgia but he does know human beings; and, from the background which he has seen slightly and heard of all his life through the lips of others, he paints things that are true, not with Dutch exactness, but rather with an impressionist’s sweep of color. He is an artist with words but a conscious artist who offends often by his apparently undue striving for effect. On the other hand his powerful book is filled with felicitous phrases—Karintha, “carrying beauty perfect as the dusk when the sun goes down,”—\n\n\nHair—\n\nSilver-grey\n\nLike streams of stars\n\nOr again, “face flowed into her eyes—flowed in soft creamy foam and plaintive ripples.” His emotion is for the most part entirely objective. One does not feel that he feels much and yet the fervor of his descriptions shows that he has felt or knows what feeling is. His art carries much that is difficult or even impossible to understand. The artist, of course, has a right deliberately to make his art a puzzle to the interpreter (the whole world is a puzzle) but on the other hand I am myself unduly irritated by this sort of thing. I cannot, for the life of me, for instance see why Toomer could not have made the tragedy of Carma something that I could understand instead of vaguely guess at; “Box Seat” muddles me to the last degree and I am not sure that I know what “Kabnis” is about. All of these essays and stories, even when I do not understand them, have their strange flashes of power, their numerous messages and numberless reasons for being. But still for me they are partially spoiled.\nToomer strikes me as a man who has written a powerful book but who is still watching for the fullness of his strength and for that calm certainty of his art which will undoubtedly come with years.\nIt had been my intention when I began this essay to discuss also Miss Fauset’s novel. But Mr. Locke has sent us such an admirable and discriminating disquisition on this book that I gladly yield to him. –W. E. B. D.\n\nII\n\nThe novel that the Negro intelligentzia have been clamoring for has arrived with Jessie Fauset’s first novel, “There is Confusion” (Boni & Liveright, New York). What they have been wanting, if I interpret rightly, is not merely a race story told from the inside, but a cross section of the race life higher up the social pyramid and further from the base-line of the peasant and the soil than is usually taken. We scarcely realize how by reaction to social prejudice we have closed our better circles physically and psychologically: it is not always the fault of the novelist that he can depict only the peasant type and his urban analogue, the Negro of the slums. But here in refreshing contrast with the bulk of fiction about the Negro, we have a novel of the educated and aspiring classes. Miss Fauset has, however, not made the error of growing rootless flowers or exploring detached levels. Indeed she has sketched a Negro group against a wide social background of four generations—almost as much perspective as can be gotten on any social group in America, and moreover has not glossed over the slave régime, its ugly facts and its uglier consequences, though she has treated it incidentally as part of the genealogy and heredity of her characters. It is essentially a novel of blood and ancestry such as might be expected to come from the Philadelphia tradition which the author shares, and the Philadelphia scene which is part of her story. Yet it is too contemporary, not merely in incident, but in the phase of the race problem which it reflects, to be a period novel, a resurrection of the past. On the contrary it throbs with some of the latest reactions of the race situation in this country upon the psychology and relations of colored and white Americans of the more intelligent classes. It is this delineation of the problem as seen from the heights of respectability and from at least a plateau of culture that sharply differentiates Miss Fauset’s novel from others.\nJoanna Marshall—more a heroine than most heroines, since she actually focusses and dominates in turn the life of her family, the estrangements and marriages of her brother and of her lover—is a strange character at war against herself. One part stoic, one part artistic, one part human with an emotional intensity and sincerity that is not Caucasian, she achieves success in her art at the very instant of her greatest disillusionment; but not before she has played unconscious havoc with several lives by her ambition and unswerving devotion to the ideals of success.\nComplicated as these lives are at almost every turn by the peculiar handicaps and confusions of color, it is well for the artistry and the worth of the book that the primary confusions are those more universal ones of human nature and its type-psychologies. The atmosphere of the book is that of Quaker faith and sober optimism, and its constructive suggestion is that of an eventual mutual understanding and coöperation through the discipline of experience. It is as though two antithetic sides of life, male and female, white and black, had each to work out its own chastening and enlargement through sorrow and disillusionment to find itself, late but not always too tragically late, able to rise from the level of confusion to the level of coöperation and understanding:\nThe book has what I maintain is the prime essential for novels with such subject matter—social perspective, social sanity. A problem novel without this is either a raw and brutal cross-sectioning or medicated and unpalatable propaganda. From these two evils, the book happily and skillfully escapes. Of the style, one may say, that it fits the subject—and in this day of the confusion and compounding of styles, what can be better said? Certainly it sustains with interest a story that is more heavily ballasted with truth than two or three of the usual run of social novels that sail on a breezy style to the heavens of “six best sellers.” So that it can be confidently commended to that increasing band who, thank God, want truth with their fiction, and who will welcome especially upon the race question and its reactions on the best types and classes of colored folk, a social document of sterling and intimate character. –A. L.\n\nIII\n\nThese, then, are the two books of the younger Negro Movement; read them and enjoy them as I have done and spread the glad tidings. –W. E. B.

    "text": "A History of the Negro Race in the World War and After\n\nChapter 1. Interpretations\nWhat is the ruling power in any given country? Speaking modernwise most would say Public Opinion. But this of course is a loose and inaccurate term. Opinion is individual. No “Public” can have an “opinion.” The figure of speech is permissible but easily and crassly misleading. It is the power, wishes, opinion of certain persons which rule the world. These Dominant Wills may rule by physical force, or superior intelligence or greater wealth or logical persuasion, and consequently may be regarded as Dominant Powers or Dominant Wishes or Dominant Intelligence or Highest Good—but always whatever rules exhibits itself as Will—action, effective deed. To these Dominant Wills, be it the Will of One, or the Agreements of Many—of a Minority or of a Majority, and be it put in power by chance, force or reason—there must be, as long as it rules, the Submission of all individuals to its mandates. In these Current Submissions of individual men lies the core and kernel of modern ethical judgment of group action.\nThe effort to make these acts of submission free individual judgments is the movement toward Freedom. But Freedom is always restrained by the fear that the dethroning of the Dominant Wills at any time—that is, the refusal of a large number of persons to submit to a particular opinion or set of opinions—will result in the partial or total overthrow of civilized society, before enough submissions acknowledge, and thus enthrone, another Dominant Will. It is this fear of anarchy that leads to the persistent opposition to the right to challenge the Dominant Wills. The Right of Challenge is Democracy, and to Democracy the momentarily Dominant Wills are almost always opposed, particularly if dominion is based on force or bribery.\nIf the Dominant Wills are based on reason why should they fear universal Challenge—universal Democracy? Because most people are too inexperienced to get at the truth and too ignorant to reason correctly on given data. This ignorance can be corrected by universal education, but the Dominant Wills sometimes (1) do not believe in the possibility of educating all folk; (2) have desires and ambitions which can be satisfied only by the persistence of ignorance among the mass.\nThus the Dominant Wills in most periods of history have opposed the Challenge of Democracy because they desire the ignorance of most men. And they defend this desire by the assertion or even passionate belief that most men must and should be ignorant if civilization is to prevail.\nHere then lies the heart and kernel of all social and political problems at any time. First we must ask whose is this Dominant Will? Then, is there any right of challenge and who can and does exercise the right? What is the attitude of the Dominant Will toward the increased intelligence and efficiency of men?\nIn the first quarter of the 20th century, the Dominant Wills in most lands are the wills of those persons who are seeking Incomes as distinguished from Wages and who are, by training, masters of the intricate organization of modern commerce and industry. The distinction between Income and Wage is of course not absolute, but Wage usually means a direct return for personal effort, while Income is the return which one commands by reason of his property rights or influence or social power. It is the almost universal ambition of men today to receive sufficient Income so as to make personal exertion on their part unnecessary—in other words, as we say, they desire to be “independent.”\nThe income-receiving persons form a small but intelligent and highly specialized minority of men, while the mass of men are wage-earners or community workers in unorganized industry. So powerful and persuasive is this ruling class that most people identify its will with civilization and its industrial aims with life itself. Industry is life—commerce is government, they say openly or silently. Now modern industry requires (1) large accumulations of tools, machines, materials and transition goods and (2) regular skilled labor working over large areas of time and space synchronized with machine-like co-operation. The result is great income in goods and services which the Dominant Wills may allocate as they wish; and since the raison d’étre of the present supporters of the Dominant Wills is the desire to share largely in this income, present government tends to support and develop the rich.\nTo this tendency is opposed the interest of the majority of men who are wage earners or in unorganized or primitive industry. What Right of Challenge have they before the Dominant Will? The democratic movement of the 19th century gave a few of them (the men in organized industry) a nominal right to challenge legally and at regular intervals the Dominant Wills. This Right to Vote—a mighty landmark in the advance of Man, and one which every group achieves sooner or later, or dissolves—is the beginning and not the end of democracy and meets at the outset baffling difficulties and limitations. These are chiefly (1) Ignorance (2) Propaganda (3) Law and Custom.\n\nHuman society in its industrial, religious, aesthetic and other aspects is a tremendously intricate mechanism. Few even of the most intelligent grasp it thoroughly and most men have no adequate conception of it. When now the Dominant Wills of a society form a trained group led by their selfish interests as well as their intelligence and ideals to fasten themselves in power, the ignorant mass has small chance of using their vote with enough intelligence to dislodge them without catastrophe to the State. The evident remedy for this is Education, the formal training of Children, the higher training of Youth, and the broader training of Citizens by experience, information, contacts and art—in other words the spread of Truth.\nBut the spread of Truth is undertaken today by Propaganda. Now the dissemination of Truth presupposes normally a group of absolutely impartial Truth Bearers or Teachers or Priests or Prophets who know the Truth and who quite impartially and persistently make all free of it who will listen. But Propaganda is the effort not necessarily to spread the Truth, but to make people BELIEVE that what they hear is true; and to the propagandist any means which will accomplish this end of passionate, of unwavering and of forcible uncritical belief is justifiable. This is a dangerous but a very widespread method of public teaching today and what makes it most dangerous is the use which it makes of the Lie.\nLying is so dangerous an enemy to organized human life that usually it is regarded as an absolutely unjustifiable instrument of human advance. Yet manifestly everyone admits certain extreme cases when a deliberate Lie can be defended; and many are willing to use a partial truth to gain a good end while millions are willing without any attempt at investigation or corroboration to assume as true anything that they passionately wish to be true. Propaganda then, with large use of the deliberate Lie, the Half Truth and the Unproven Wish, has become a tremendous weapon in our day and is used particularly by the Dominant Wills to establish themselves in power by voluntary limitation of the Right of Challenge, or in other words by limiting the right to vote or the votable questions or the general field of democratic government. By this means most people today are convinced that the matters of work, wages and organized industry are quite beyond the possibility of democratic control and always will be; while a goodly number believe that the inter-relations of great nations can never be matters of open popular decision and many think that the making and interpreting of laws is not a matter for the average voter to have a voice in.\nFinally Law systems greatly impede democracy. Law is the attempt to reduce to logical statement the Dominant Will of the day. This is an exceedingly difficult task in itself but it is made more difficult because both the statement and the interpretation of the statement’s meaning in particular cases are in the hands of technicians. These technically trained lawyers are dominated on the one hand by a mediaeval desire for perfections and consistency which makes them slaves to the precedents of dead centuries, and on the other hand they drift largely into the pay and control of the dominant income-seeking classes.\n\nThus ignorance, propaganda and customary law have so delimited the field of practical political democracy that it has become a very ineffective method of challenging the rule of the Dominant Wills. At the same time the rule of the Income-seekers has become peculiarly oppressive and dangerous, and for this reason the call for democratic control becomes more and more insistent. To repeat: In order to understand modern civilized life one must realize the conflict which has arisen between the Income Seekers and the Wage Earners. The great accomplishment of the 19th century was the organization of work—the far gathering of raw materials, the making of tools, machines and production goods and the synchronizing of effort. The result is a marvelous triumph of human skill and efficiency in making available a miraculous amount of consumptive goods and human services. If these goods and services had been designed for and applied to satisfying the highest wants of the mass of men our advance in culture would have been tremendous. It has been great despite the fact that the annual output of goods and services is arranged mainly to satisfy the wants of a small but powerful minority of the civilized world.\nThe power of this minority arises from their monopoly of finished goods, materials and production goods, which enables them largely to determine what goods shall be produced and what services paid for and at what rate, and also the ownership of the goods and services. This tremendous power—by far the greatest of modern days, and overshadowing most political power—has been successfully challenged with very great difficulty. The hindrances are: the widespread ignorance of the industrial process; the desire of most men to share this vast power rather than curb it; the use of widespread propaganda to prove the impossibility of any fundamental change in the control of industry. In this way Democratic control has been largely kept out of industry and the owners of goods and materials have become the almost unchallenged Dominant Wills of the World.\nAlmost, but not quite, unchallenged, for the wage-earners have begun the challenge. The wage-earners are those whose work is determined and wages fixed by the Income Owners. There are among them a large number of Income-Seekers—i.e. those who wish not so much to curb the power of the Income Owners as to share their spoils. But gradually there has grown up among them an opinion that the wage system is right and the income system wrong, that every one should work and be paid for the work, and that the ownership of materials and productive goods should vest in the democratically controlled state. Meantime, however, before this thought became clear in their minds, their practical protest was against the amount of wages allotted them. It was too small for decent living or the rearing of children, especially when contrasted with the riches and power of the industrial world. At first they were answered that the rate of wages was not a matter of will but of natural law. Wages could not be increased save by reducing the number of laborers, by starvation, cataclysm, or voluntary restraints. This the laborers refused to believe. They tried to use political power, but were baffled by ignorance, law and propaganda.\nWaters dammed in one direction burst their bounds in other and unexpected places. Democratic control, baffled in electing officials and law-making, found a new weapon in the Strike and Boycott. That is, realizing that the heart and centre of the Income-Seeker’s power was his synchronizing of the industrial process over wide areas coupled with control of materials and machines, the hand workers sought to stop their coöperation and to refuse to work or refuse to buy at such critical times and places as would compel consideration of their wishes.\nPropaganda and legal obstacles were for years used against the Strike, but after a century it has become a recognized weapon of offense by Wage-Earners against Employers. The open warfare of the Strike gradually softened into the parleys of the Labor Union and the Corporations; then came the shop committees and Coöperative buying, and there was foreshadowed the syndicalist control of factories and Coöperative production.\nThis development stimulated political democracy by educating the voters in the intricacies of industrial organization and giving them experience in group work. More political activity and more effective voting appeared so that the State itself was forced not only into some general control of Industry but even into undertaking certain lines of industrial activity. Industrial Democracy or rather Democracy in Industry seemed the swiftly approaching goal of civilization at the opening of the 20th century.\nBut the Dominant Wills of the Income Seekers were moving to wider conquests and had been for nearly fifty years, and the very triumphs of Industrial Democracy furnished an opportunity. Beginning with the African Slave trade a world commerce had grown up. Like national industry it began haphazard and was gradually organized and systematized. Gradually the local and national industrial systems tended to become cogs in the wheel of an international industrial organization. The basic foundations of this vaster set of enterprises were: (A) The ownership of vast areas of “colonies” inhabited by semi-civilized people; (B) Slave labor or peons without wage; (C) A monopoly of valuable raw material; (D) A monopoly of transportation facilities. On this foundation it was proposed to build a national set of industries, and in these industries the wage earner would be pacified by high wages and even allowed some measure of democratic control. In other words the Dominant Wills proposed to share some of their economic power with the laborers in return for the political consent of the Laborer to the policy of conquest, slavery, monopoly and theft in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and Central and South America.\nThis New Imperialism has widely prevailed and its way has been cleared by a new Propaganda. This Propaganda bases itself mainly on Race and Color—human distinctions long since discarded by Science as of little or no real significance. But this false scientific dogma which the 18th century rejected with avidity making freedom the basis of a new and world wide Humanity has been revamped by 20th century Industrialism as an Eternal Truth, so that most modern men of the masses believe the advancement of civilization necessarily involves slavery, lust and rapine in Africa.\nWith scarce an articulate word of protest then the world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was hurriedly divided up among European Countries and the United States into colonies owned or controlled by white civilized nations, or “spheres of influence” dominated by them. To the casual glance of most folk this was simply a process of civilizing barbarians, “protecting” them and “developing” their resources. But its real nature is manifest when we ask, “For whose benefit is this New Imperialism of the white over the darker world?” Before 1914 the world answered with shrill accord, “For the benefit of the whites!” And they believed, thanks to organized Propaganda, that the salvation of Civilized Europe lay in the degradation of Uncivilized Africa and the subjection of the Balkans, Asia and the islands of the sea.\nSince 1914, we are less assured. Since 1914 we have begun to fear lest our theory of exploitation of the semi-barbarians may not necessarily involve our own glorification. And this because in allocating the spoils of the Earth, Europe fell into a jealous quarrel that nearly overthrew Civilization and left it mortally wounded. Some there are still who see in this greatest catastrophe which the world ever knew simply a failure to agree. They argue that if Germany had not been so greedy and had been satisfied with the domination of Asia Minor, half of Portuguese Africa, and part of the Belgian Congo; and if Austria had been content with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and had not coveted Serbia, Roumania and most of the Balkans—that in this case the world industrial dominion under England, Germany, France, Italy and the United States could have been established and maintained. But is this true? On the contrary, it is a very doubtful truth. This God-defying dream had a thousand seeds of disaster: not simply a hundred recurring points of disagreement in colonial expansion and development, but the inevitable future reaction of the wage earners of Europe and the natives of the colonies.\nSooner or later Europe would learn two facts: (1) The dullest European wage-earner will gradually come to see that by upholding Imperial Aggression over the darker peoples by his political vote and his growing economic power he is but fastening tighter on himself the rule of the Rich; (2) Not even the most successful Propaganda, aided by Pseudo-Science and human hatred, can forever keep the white wage-earner from realizing that the victims of imperial greed in Asia and Africa are human beings like himself—suffering like him and from like causes, held in degradation and ignorance and like him, too, capable of infinite uplift and of ruling themselves and the world.\nThe Crisis then was bound to come. It did come in 1914–18. The Great War was a Scourge, an Evil, a retrogression to Barbarism, a waste, a wholesale murder. It was not necessary—it was precipitated by the will of men.\nWho was to blame? Not Germany but certain Germans. Not England but certain Englishmen. Not France but certain Frenchmen. All those modern civilized citizens who submitted voluntarily to the Dominant Wills of those who ruled the leading lands in 1914 were blood guilty of the murder of the men who fell in the war. More guilty were those whose acts and thoughts made up the Dominant Wills and who were willing to increase their incomes at the expense of those who suffer in Europe and out, under the present industrial system. There is no dodging the issue. Guilt is personal. Deed is personal, Opinion and Will are personal. Systems and Nations are not to blame—individuals are to blame. Individuals caused the Great War, did its deviltry and are guilty of its endless Crime.\nOn account of its length and its frankly pro-Negro attitude, it is possible that Dr. Du Bois’ history of the Negro in the World War will have to be published by subscription.

    "title": "Chicago and Its Eight Reasons",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Many causes have been assigned for the three days of race rioting, from July 27 to 30 in Chicago, each touching some particular phase of the general condition that led up to the outbreak. Labor union officials attribute it to the action of the packers, while the packers are equally sure that the unions themselves are directly responsible. The city administration feels that the riots were brought on to discredit the Thompson forces, while leaders of the anti-Thompson forces, prominent among them being State’s Attorney Maclay Hoyne, are sure that the administration is directly responsible. In this manner charges and counter-charges are made, but, as is usually the case, the Negro is made to bear the brunt of it all—to be “the scapegoat.” A background of strained race relations brought to a head more rapidly through political corruption, economic competition and clashes due to the overflow of the greatly increased colored population into sections outside of the so-called “Black Belt,” embracing the Second and Third Wards, all of these contributed, aided by magnifying of Negro crime by newspapers, the the formation of a situation where only a spark was needed to ignite the flames of racial antagonism. That spark was contributed by a white youth when he knocked a colored lad off a raft at the 29th Street bathing beach and the colored boy was drowned.\nFour weeks spent in studying the situation in Chicago, immediately following the outbreaks, seem to show at least eight general causes for the riots, and the same conditions, to a greater or less degree, can be found in almost every large city with an appreciable Negro population. These causes, taken after a careful study in order of their prominence, are:\n\nRace Prejudice.\nEconomic Competition.\nPolitical Corruption and Exploitation of Negro Voters.\nPolice Inefficiency.\nNewspaper Lies about Negro Crime\nUnpunished Crimes Against Negroes.\nHousing.\nReaction of Whites and Negroes from War.\n\nSome of these can be grouped under the same headings, but due to the prominence of each they are listed as separate causes.\nPrior to 1915, Chicago had been famous for its remarkably fair attitude toward colored citizens. Since that time, when the migratory movement from the South assumed large proportions, the situation has steadily grown more and more tense. This was due in part to the introduction of many Negroes who were unfamiliar with city ways and could not, naturally, adapt themselves immediately to their new environment. Outside of a few sporadic attempts, little was done to teach them the rudimentary principles of sanitation, of conduct or of their new status as citizens under a system different from that in the South. During their period of absorption into the new life, their care-free, at times irresponsible and sometimes even boisterous, conduct caused complications difficult to adjust. But equally important, though seldom considered, is the fact that many Southern whites have also come into the North, many of them to Chicago, drawn by the same economic advantages that attracted the colored workman. The exact figure is unknown, but it is estimated by men who should know that fully 20,000 of them are in Chicago. These have spread the virus of race hatred and evidences of it can be seen in Chicago on every hand. This same cause underlies each of the other seven causes.\n\nWith regard to economic competition, the age-long dispute between capital and labor enters. Large numbers of Negroes were brought from the South by the packers and there is little doubt that this was done in part so that the Negro might be used as a club over the heads of the unions. John Fitzpatrick and Ed Nockels, president and secretary, respectively, of the Chicago Federation of Labor, and William Buck, editor of the New Majority, a labor organ, openly charge that the packers subsidized colored ministers, politicians and Y. M. C. A. secretaries to prevent the colored workmen at the stockyards from entering the unions. On the other hand, the Negro workman is not at all sure as to the sincerity of the unions themselves. The Negro in Chicago yet remembers the waiters’ strike some years ago, when colored union workers walked out at the command of the unions and when the strike was settled, the unions did not insist that Negro waiters be given their jobs back along with whites, and, as a result, colored men have never been able to get back into some of the hotels even to the present day. The Negro is between “the devil and the deep blue sea.” He feels that if he goes into the unions, he will lose the friendship of the employers. He knows that if he does not, he is going to be met with the bitter antagonism of the unions. With the exception of statements made by organizers, who cannot be held to accountability because of their minor official connection, no statements have been made by the local union leaders, outside of high sounding, but meaningless, protestations of friendship for the Negro worker. He feels that he has been given promises too long already. In fact, he is “fed up” on them. What he wants are binding statements and guarantees that cannot be broken at will.\nWith the possible exception of Philadelphia, there is probably no city in America with more of political trickery, chicanery and exploitation than Chicago. Against the united and bitter opposition of every daily newspaper in Chicago, William Hale Thompson was elected again as mayor, due, as was claimed, to the Negro and German vote. While it is not possible to state that the anti-Thompson element deliberately brought on the riots, yet it is safe to say that they were not averse to its coming. The possibility of such a clash was seen many months before it actually occurred, yet no steps were taken to prevent it. The purpose of this was to secure a two-fold result. First, it would alienate the Negro set from Thompson through a belief that was expected to grow among the colored vote when it was seen that the police force under the direction of the mayor was unable or unwilling to protect the colored people from assault by mobs. Secondly, it would discourage the Negroes from registering and voting and thus eliminate the powerful Negro vote in Chicago. Whether or not this results remains to be seen. In talking with a prominent colored citizen of Chicago, asking why the Negroes supported Thompson so unitedly, his very significant reply was:\n\nThe Negro in Chicago, as in every other part of America, is fighting for the fundamental rights of citizenship. If a candidate for office is wrong on every other public question except this, the Negroes are going to vote for that man, for that is their only way of securing the things they want and that are denied them.\n\nThe value of the Negro vote to Thompson can be seen in a glance at the recent election figures. His plurality was 28,000 votes. In the second ward it was 14,000 and in the third, 10,000. The second and third wards constitute most of what is known as the “Black Belt.”\nThe fourth contributing cause was the woeful inefficiency and criminal negligence of the police authorities of Chicago, both prior to and during the riots. Prostitution, gambling and the illicit sale of whisky flourish openly and apparently without any fear whatever of police interference.\nIn a most dangerous statement, State’s Attorney Maclay Hoyne, on August 25, declared that the riots were due solely to vice in the second ward. He seemed either to forget or to ignore the flagrant disregard of law and order and even of the common principles of decency in city management existing in many other sections of the city.\nAll of this tended to contribute to open disregard for law and almost contempt for it. Due either to political “pull” or to reciprocal arrangements, many notorious dives run and policemen are afraid to arrest the proprietors.\nDuring the riots the conduct of the police force as a whole was equally open to criticism. State’s Attorney Hoyne openly charged the police with arresting colored rioters and with an unwillingness to arrest white rioters. Those who were arrested were at once released. In one case a colored man who was fair enough to appear to be white was arrested for carrying concealed weapons, together with five white men and a number of colored men. All were taken to a police station; the light colored man and the five whites being put into one cell and the other colored men in another. In a few minutes the light colored man and the five whites were released and their ammunition given back to them with the remark, “You’ll probably need this before the night is over.”\nFifth on the list is the effect of newspaper publicity concerning Negro crime. With the exception of the Daily News, all of the papers of Chicago have played up in prominent style with glaring, prejudice-breeding headlines every crime or suspected crime committed by Negroes. Headlines such as “NEGRO BRUTALLY MURDERS PROMINENT CITIZEN,” “NEGRO ROBS HOUSE” and the like have appeared with alarming frequency and the news articles beneath such headlines have been of the same sort. During the rioting such headlines as “NEGRO BANDITS TERRORIZE TOWN,” “RIOTERS BURN 100 HOMES—NEGROES SUSPECTED OF HAVING PLOTTED BLAZE” appeared. In the latter case a story was told of witnesses seeing Negroes in automobiles applying torches and fleeing. This was the story given to the press by Fire Attorney John R. McCabe after a casual and hasty survey. Later the office of State Fire Marshall Gamber proved conclusively that the fires were not caused by Negroes, but by whites. As can easily be seen such newspaper accounts did not tend to lessen the bitterness of feeling between the conflicting groups. Further, many wild and unfounded rumors were published in the press—incendiary and inflammatory to the highest degree, a few of them being given below in order to show their nature. Some are:\n\n\nOver 1,000 Negroes had been slain and their bodies thrown in “Bubbly Creek” and the Chicago River.\n\nA Negro had been lynched and hanged from a “Loop” building overlooking Madison Street.\n\nA white woman had been attacked and mutilated by a Negro on State Street. A Negro woman had been slain, her breasts cut off and her infant had been killed by having its brains dashed out against a wall.\n\nA white child had been outraged by a colored man.\n\nA white child had been kidnapped by a band of colored men and its body later found, badly mutilated and dismembered.\n\nImmediately following the riots, a white woman was murdered in Evanston, Ill. Immediately the crime was laid at the door of a colored man with whom the woman had been intimate a number of years. Pitiful stories were told of the woman waiting fr hours on street corners for “just one look at her Billiken-like, mulatto lover,” played up under headlines such as “CONFESSION EXPECTED TODAY FROM NEGRO SUSPECT,” “NEGRO SUSPECT RAPIDLY WEAKENING” and the like which clearly led one to believe that the colored man was guilty. A few days later, in an obscure item on an inside page, a short account was given of the release of the colored suspect “because insufficient evidence to hold him” existed. A long period of such publicity had inflamed the minds of many people against Negroes who otherwise would have been unprejudiced. Much of the blame for the riots can be laid to such sources.\nFor a long period prior to the riots, organized gangs of white hoodlums had been perpetrating crimes against Negroes for which no arrests had been made. These gangs in many instances masqueraded under the name of “Athletic and Social Clubs” and later direct connection was shown between them and incendiary fires started during the riots. Colored men, women and children had been beaten in the parks, most of them in Jackson and Lincoln Parks. In one case a young colored girl was beaten and thrown into a lagoon. In other cases Negroes were beaten so severely that they had to be taken to hospitals. All of these cases had caused many colored people to wonder if they could expect any protection whatever from the authorities. Particularly vicious in their attacks was an organization known locally as “Regan’s Colts.”\nMuch has been written and said concerning the housing situation in Chicago and its effect on the racial situation. The problem is a simple one. Since 1915 the colored population of Chicago has more than doubled, increasing in four years from a little over 50,000 to what is now estimated to be between 125,000 and 150,000. Most of them lived in the area bounded by the railroad on the west, 30th Street on the north, 40th Street on the south and Ellis Avenue on east. Already overcrowded this so-called “Black Belt” could not possibly hold the doubled colored population. One cannot put ten gallons of water in a five-gallon pail. Although many Negroes had been living in “white” neighborhoods, the increased exodus from the old areas created an hysterical group of persons who formed “Property Owners’ Associations” for the purpose of keeping intact white neighborhoods. Prominent among these was the Kenwood-Hyde Park Property Owners’ Improvement Association, as well as the Park Manor Improvement Association. Early in June the writer, while in Chicago, attended a private meeting of the first named at the Kenwood Club House, at Lake Park Avenue and 47th Street. Various plans were discussed for keeping the Negroes in “their part of the town,” such as securing the discharge of colored persons from positions they held when they attempted to move into “white” neighborhoods, purchasing mortgages of Negroes buying homes and ejecting them when mortgage notes fell due and were unpaid, and many more of the same caliber. The language of many speakers was vicious and strongly prejudicial and had the distinct effect of creating race bitterness.\nIn a number of cases during the period from January, 1918, to August, 1919, there were bombings of colored homes and houses occupied by Negroes outside of the “Black Belt.” During this period no less than twenty bombings took place, yet only two persons have been arrested and neither of the two has been convicted, both cases being continued.\nFinally, the new spirit aroused in Negroes by their war experiences enters into the problem. From Local Board No. 4, embracing the neighborhood in the vicinity of State and 35th Streets, containing over 30,000 inhabitants of which fully ninety per cent are colored, over 9,000 men registered uandad 1,850 went to camp. These men, with their new outlook on life, injected the same spirit of independence into their companions, a thing that is true of many other sections of America. One of the greatest surprises to many of those who came down to “clean out the niggers” is that these same “niggers” fought back. Colored men saw their own kind being killed, heard of many more and believed that their live; and liberty were at stake. In such a spirit most of the fighting was done.\n\n\n\nThe “Infuriated” White Mob in Chicago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro Politician (1928)\nThe Challenge of Detroit (1925)\nThe Black Man and Labor (1925)\nA Statement (1919)\nDodging the Issue (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nWalter F., White. 1919. “Chicago and Its Eight Reasons.”\nThe Crisis 18 (6): 293–97. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/06/chicago_and_its_eight_reasons.html."

    "text": "The Children’s  Crisis has been published annually for nine years and is easily the most popular number of the year—that is, it makes the widest appeal to our readers. This is as it should be. Of course, we are and must be interested in our children above all else, if we love our race and humanity.\nBut in the problem of our children we black folk are sorely puzzled. For example, a little girl writes us—we remember her as red-bronze and black-curled, with dancing eyes—“I want to learn more about my race, so I want to begin early. … I hate the white man just as much as he hates me and probably more!”\nThink of this from twelve little years! And yet, can you blame the child? To the consternation of the Editors of The Crisis we have had to record some horror in nearly every Children’s Number—in 1915, it was Leo Frank; in 1916, the lynching at Gainesville, Fla.; in 1917 and 1918, the riot and court martial at Houston, Tex., etc.\nThis was inevitable in our rôle as newspaper—but what effect must it have on our children? To educate them in human hatred is more disastrous to them than to the hated; to seek to raise them in ignorance of their racial identity and peculiar situation is inadvisable—impossible.\nThere seems but one alternative: We shall publish hereafter not ONE Children’s Number a year, but TWELVE! Messrs. Du Bois and Dill will issue in November, in co-operation with The Crisis, but as an entirely separate publication, a little magazine for children—for all children, but especially for ours, “the Children of the Sun.”\nIt will be called, naturally, The Brownies’ Book, and as we have advertised, “It will be a thing of Joy and Beauty, dealing in Happiness, Laughter and Emulation, and designed especially for Kiddies from Six to Sixteen.\n\nIt will seek to teach Universal Love and Brotherhood for all little folk—black and brown and yellow and white.\n\nOf course, pictures, puzzles, stories, letters from little ones, clubs, games and oh—everything!\n\nDeftly intertwined with this mission of entertainment will go the endeavor:\n\n\nTo make colored children realize that being “colored” is a normal, beautiful thing.\n\n\nTo make them familiar with the history and achievements of the Negro race.\n\n\nTo make them know that other colored children have grown into beautiful, useful and famous persons.\n\n\nTo teach them delicately a code of honor and action in their relations with white children.\n\n\nTo turn their little hurts and resentments into emulation, ambition and love of their own homes and companions.\n\n\nTo point out the best amusements and joys and worth-while things of life.\n\n\nTo inspire them to prepare for definite occupations and duties with a broad spirit of sacrifice.\n\n\nThis is a great program—a tremendous task. We want the advice of all mothers and fathers, of all men and women and children in helping us accomplish it. We can conceive of no more splendid duty at this critical hour.\nWrite us in care of The Brownies’ Book, 2 West Thirteenth Street, New York City, and—incidentally—send a One Dollar subscription for a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNegro Writers (1920)\nBrowsing Reader - The American Race Problem (1927)\nOf Children (1912)\nA Statement (1919)\nA Little Play (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “The True Brownies.”\nThe Crisis 18 (6): 285–86. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/06/true_brownies.html."

    "text": "Neither R. R. Moton nor W. E. B. Du Bois had the slightest idea that the other was planning to sail for France, December 1, until they met in Washington on a quest for passports, November 30. They sailed together on the Orizaba and frankly discussed their agreements and disagreements. When they reached France, each went about his own business.\nDr. Moton was sent by the President of the United States and the Secretary of War to see and talk to Negro troops. Dr. Du Bois was sent by the N.A.A.C.P. and The Crisis to gather the historical facts concerning Negro troops and to call a Pan-African Congress.\nOn the night before Dr. Moton started out a colored man of national reputation and unquestioned integrity who had been in France six months took him aside and told him frankly the situation: the rampant American prejudice against black troops and officers and the bitter resentment of the victims. Dr. Mton’s letters gave him every opportunity. A special Army Order preceded him, which read:\n\nDr. R. R. Moton, President of Tuskegee University, will be present in the Divisional area for the next few days. The Division Commander directs that commanding officers render all possible assistance in any visit or inspection Dr. Moton desires to make. They will also see that he is accorded every opportunity to make any observation he may wish to make.\n\nWhat did Dr. Moton do? He rushed around as fast as possible. He took with him and had at his elbow every moment that evil genius of the Negro race, Thomas Jesse Jones, a white man. Dr. Moton took no time to investigate or inquire. He made a few speeches, of which one is reported by a hearer as follows:\n\nThe address delivered by Dr. Moton to the men consisted of one or two jokes by a colored preacher, the assurance that the people at home were proud of them and the manner in which they should act upon their return to the United States, dwelling almost entirely upon the phrase “Not to be arrogant.” After he had spoken to the men the Major informed the officers that Dr. Moton desired to hold secret conference with them. All officers congregated in the office. After being presented to the officers Dr. Moton stated that he had been sent to France by President Wilson and Mr. Baker for the purpose of speaking to the colored troops. He also stated that he had just left Paris where he had been in conference with President Wilson and had asked the President his views as to the practical application of democracy toward the colored man in the United States, but ending by saying: “I was very much pleased with his reply; but, gentlemen, I cannot quote the President.\n\nAfter Dr. Moton finished his talk no opportunity was given to the officers to inform him of the conditions that had existed in France, and he did not seek any information relative to same from any of the officers after the conference ended,\n\nDr. Moton then returned to Paris and met Colonel House, General Pershing and others. Colonel House told the writer that he urged Dr. Moton to remain in Paris and that if he would, Colonel House would give him an opportunity to appear in person before the Peace Conference to speak for the black world. Dr. Moton refused to stay, but promised to return. He then went to England and secured an audience with Lloyd George, Prime Minister of England.

When the murderer comes, he shall not longer strike us in the back. When the armed lynchers gather, we too must gather armed. When the mob moves, we propose to meet it with bricks and clubs and guns.\nBut we must tread here with solemn caution.

We must defend ourselves, our homes, our wives and children against the lawless without stint or hesitation; but we must carefully and scrupulously avoid on our own part bitter and unjustifiable aggression against anybody.\nThis line is difficult to draw. In the South the Police and Public Opinion back the mob and the least resistance on the part of the innocent black victim is nearly always construed as a lawless attack on society and government. In the North the Police and the Public will dodge and falter, but in the end they will back the Right when the Truth is made clear to them.\nBut whether the line between just resistance and angry retaliation is hard or easy, we must draw it carefully, not in wild resentment, but in grim and sober consideration; and then back of the impregnable fortress of the Divine Right of Self-Defense, which is sanctioned by every law of God and man, in every land, civilized and uncivilized, we must take our unfaltering stand.\nHonor, endless and undying Honor, to every man, black or white, who in Houston, East St. Louis, Washington and Chicago gave his life for Civilization and Order.\nIf the United States is to be a Land of Law, we would live humbly and peaceably in it—working, singing, learning and dreaming to make it and ourselves nobler and better; if it is to be a Land of Mobs and Lynchers, we might as well die today as tomorrow.\n\n\nAnd how can man die better\n\nThan facing fearful odds\n\nFor the ashes of his fathers\n\nAnd the temples of his gods?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThirteen (1918)\nCrime (1920)\nForward (1920)\nLogic (1913)\nCounsels of Despair (1934)\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “Let Us Reason Together.”\nThe Crisis 18 (5): 231. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/05/let_us_reason_together.html."

    "text": "This is a program of reconstruction within the Negro race in America, after the the revolution of world war. In Education we must take up the problem of the colored child in the white school. At present the tendency is to accept and even demand separate schools because our children so often are neglected, mistreated and humiliated in the public schools. This is a dangerous and inadvisable alternative and a wicked surrender of principle for which our descendants will pay dearly. Our policy should be to form in connection with each school and district effective Parents’ Associations, composed of the fathers, mothers and friends of colored pupils; these associations should establish friendly relations with teachers and school authorities, urge parents to wash and dress their children properly, help look after truancy and poverty, arrange for home work and tuition for the backward, curb delinquency and be, in fine, a vigilance committee to keep the public school open to all and fit the Negro child for it.\nIn Religion we must, in the larger cities, stop building and purchasing new church edifices and begin to invest the money of the church in homes, land and business, and philanthropic enterprises for the benefit of the people. Individual home ownership in most large cities is today difficult; but a group of people who can buy and pay for a hundred thousand dollar church can purchase a hundred thousand dollar apartment house and run it. It is a simple business proposition and requires only elementary honesty and ordinary executive ability. Churches can easily begin co-operative buying of coal, bread and meat, using their own premises for distribution; churches in the country and small towns can buy farms and rent or run them; the church can purchase automobile trucks and help the Negro farmer market his produce independent of the railroads and thieving commission merchants; even simple manufacturing, sewing and building are not beyond the reasonable activities of church bodies. Indeed, unless the church extends its economic functions beyond the simple program of building bigger and finer edifices—unless it organizes the Negro laborer so that his entire wage will not go in rent and supporting storekeepers who despise and cheat him—unless it thus helps the laborer, it will lose the laborer. The hope of the Negro church is character-building through economic co-operation.\nIn Business the Negro must branch out into certain new lines where he has long and foolishly hesitated: We must open drygoods and haberdashery shops, meat markets and clothing stores, shoe stores and hat stores. We must gradually but persistently get into manufacturing. The deft fingers of our young people are as easily adapted to machinery as the fingers of whites. We are denied opportunity by white trade unions and by lack of pioneering courage among colored capitalists and business men. Let us wake up. The era of manufactures in the United States is just begun. The expansion of domestic and foreign trade is going to be enormous. We raise the cotton—why not spin and weave it? We dig the iron—why not weld it? We mine the coal—why not turn it to steam and power? Do we lack brains and capital? No, we lack experience and courage. Get them.\nIn Politics the colored woman is going to vote. This is our chance. Away with the old regime, the pothouse politician and white bribery. Let us form clubs and study government in city, county, state and nation. Let us know the law and the officials and their duties. Let us keep continual and rigid tabs on every candidate. Away with parties—what we want is men. Away with promises—what we want is deeds. Study, learn, register and vote. Vote at every election and see that every friend of yours votes. Pay your poll taxes and register. Do not vote for a party. Never vote a straight ticket. Vote for men and measures—not for parties. But above all, vote! Let every Negro man and woman, always and everywhere, vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSchool (1918)\nSegregation (1910)\nCollege Education (1914)\nEducation (1911)\nLynchings and Mobs (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “Reconstruction.” The Crisis\n18 (3): 130–31. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/03/reconstruction.html."

    "text": "There is one charge against the N.A.A.C.P. which is made, now openly and now by veiled innuendo, which it is necessary to answer plainly. It is said that this Association is not a Negro association, but is conducted by white people and that, therefore, it cannot effectively serve the cause of Negro freedom. The veiled assumption is that the efforts of the Negroes in the Association are controlled and largely nullified by whites.\nThe Association is not an exclusively Negro Association. We do not believe in the color line against either white or black. The N.A.A.C.P. is a union of American citizens of all colors and races who believe that Democracy in America is a failure if it proscribes Negroes, as such, politically, economically, or socially.\nThat all our officers and members are working wholeheartedly to this end is proven by the fact that this Association has done more for the emancipation of the Negro in the last ten years than any other organization of men, white, black or mixed, in the last half century. The record speaks for itself:\n\nThe overthrow of segregation\nDefeat of intermarriage laws in twelve states\nCoöperation in the “Grandfather” decision case\nModel Civil Rights bills in New York and Michigan\nThe anti-lynching campaign\nMovement for Negro Army officers\nPreventing extradition where lynching was possible\nPan-African Congress\nSpingarn Medal\nThe Crisis magazine\nOver a million pieces of literature, millions of letters, thousands of meetings, appeals, protests, etc.\n\nWe have not worked alone; what we have done has been in coöperate with numerous agencies and individuals outside our membership; but ours has been the impulse and initiative and most of the work.\nDespite all this we admit frankly and freely that we have not yet settled the Negro problem. The Negro is still disfranchised, lynched, “Jim Crowed,” robbed and insulted. But we did not expect to unravel the tangle of 300 years in 10; we did expect to start the unravelling and this the most churlish must credit us with doing.\nIf now anyone can suggest any improvement in our organization or method, we are eager to hear them; but we do not believe that the time has come, or ever will come, when we will not need the help of white Americans. To bar them from our organization would be a monstrous discrimination; it would advertise the fact that we can not or will not work with white people. If this is true, what are we doing in America or indeed in the modern world? What are we fighting for, if it is not the chance to stand with our white fellows, side by side and hand in hand, and fight for right?\nWe certainly can do this for we have. The N.A.A.C.P. consists of about 80,000 Negroes and 10,000 whites. Colored persons predominate on the Board of Directors, on the Committee of Executives and among the executive officers. Most of the white members of the board are there by the earnest invitation and insistence of the colored members, because of their influence and help. On the other hand, at no time has there been the slightest disposition to control the opinion of the colored members or officers. The policy of the N.A.A.C.P. has from the beginning been the policy proposed and advocated by the colored members of the Board and the white members have always been not only willing, but eager to promote the just demands of the Negroes as interpreted by their fellow members. In an experience of twenty-five years in organizations, boards and committees I have never been a member of a board which had more interesting or informing sessions and which, considering the volume and intricacy of its problems, had less friction and lack of good will.\nWhat we have thus accomplished in the N.A.A.C.P. is a sample of what we aim to accomplish in the nation and the world. We propose, as black folk, to work with white folk and red and yellow in this land, as equal partners in promoting the common good; in the world we will to unite with all races and nations in a world Democracy of Humanity. But what shall be said if at the beginning of our wortd quest we refuse to work with any but Negroes for any object?\nWhat is the meaning of such an attitude? Whither does it tend? Do we want to become American citizens or not? Do we want to share in a world state, or not? If we will neither of these things, then our whole aim and argument since 1863 has been wrong. What we really want is not to fight segregation, it is segregation. We want separate cities, colonies and states and eventually a separate nation. This is a possible aim. It is an aim which we may be driven by race prejudice sometime to adopt. But it is not our present aim and we cannot consistently or effectively at the same time pursue both these aims. We cannot refuse to coöperate with white Americans and simultaneously demand the right to coöperate!\nToday we can get the wholehearted coöperation of a few forward looking white Americans and of many Englishmen, Frenchmen and other Europeans; but we can have this only as we are willing to work for a world democracy of all men. If we wish in hatred or in selfishness to work simply for ourselves—if we envisage a future policy of up black, down white—we not only cannot retain the sympathy of these whites, but we invite the bitter opposition of the world; we invite race conflict of the oldest, cruellest sort; we deny and seek to crucify humanity even as our oppressors have done in time gone.\nThe N.A.A.C.P. assumes that the Negroes of the United States of America wish to be Americans, but refuse to belong to a subject caste. They demand American citizenship with every right that inheres, but what they ask for themsselves they grant just as freely to others. They believe in Negro blood and Negro genius; they seek, in voluntary unions, to develop a new Negro ethos—a music, a literature, a school of art and thought; but they will do this as freemen in a free democracy joining wholeheartedly with their fellows of all colors whenever that freedom is menaced. Not narrow, excluding, other-hating particularism, but broad, sympathetic, all-embracing nationalism is our aim and spirit.\nWe are realizing this in our organization. What we realize here we would extend to the nation and the world; and in the midst of this endeavor our own people accuse us of having white members and white fellow-officers. It is astounding and it is not altogether sincere. The real animus back of this veiled and half articulate criticism is the fact that a large organization must make enemies—must create dissatisfaction in many quarters, no matter what it does.\nOrganization is sacrifice. You cannot have absolutely your own way—you cannot be a free lance; you cannot be strongly and fiercely individual if you belong to an organization. For this reason some folk hunt and work alone. It is their nature. But the world’s greatest work must be done by team work. This demands organization, and that is the sacrifice of some individual will and wish to the good of all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Race Segregation (1934)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nThe Name Negro (1928)\nMuddle (1916)\nDoes Organization Pay?

Consider this gem from a New York morning paper: &gt; Fifth Avenue, near 114th Street, was well filled with men and women as well as crowds of children at play, about 10 o’clock last night, when a young girl accosted another of about her age, and as the latter suddenly darted off along 114th Street started in pursuit shouting: ‘Stop her! She’s a thief!’\n&gt;   &gt; Instantly there was a crowd of almost 100 men and women at the girl’s heels. She ran to Lenox Avenue, the crowd behind her increasing in numbers, and then turned down toward 113th Street. She ran swiftly and was far ahead of her nearest pursuer when Policeman Bernstein of the East 104th Street Station grabbed her at 112th Street.\nWhat of it? She was a thief—a nasty, God-forgotten thief, and perhaps worse. Moreover, she was a foreigner. Hail to the “almost 100 men and women” who ran the frightened thing like a rabbit to its warren. Behold our civilization at its highest and best; or at its lowest and worst. How shall we, the untutored groundlings, know? Where are our teachers in this day of lynching and lawlessness? What are they saying and doing?\nPick out the ten greatest men of America, beginning, of course, with the distinguished gentleman who has just declined the presidency, and coming to President Taft and the college presidents, captains of industry, professional men and leaders of culture. What have they said? Nothing. What should they say? Something—anything. The symptoms fly and spread. They shriek to Heaven. They mean something. If they mean the glorious fruition of the best of American democracy let the leaders of this people speak out and say so. If they mean Hell (and they do), where in Heaven’s name is the moral courage of this land gone to?\nThe answer is not far to seek. I wrote to an American recently—one of the best specimens of American manhood, white and wealthy and philanthropic. I said: “Join us and fight lynching, lawlessness and race prejudice.” He was resting in his pretty cottage by the blue waters of a beautiful lake with the sweet shadow of mountains, away from the city’s fetid heat, daintily served by servants, surrounded bv his books and interests—and he wrote:\n\nWith reference to your suggestion that I join your association, I am, of course, deeply interested, but have been so much impressed with what seemed to me the bitterness and unchristian spirit I have observed in various comments from time to time that I have felt that only harm could come in the long run from that temper. I sympathize strongly with the dignified protests against the suppression of the vote of the Negroes, but I am myself profoundly against war in every aspect, and believe that Jesus Christ meant to turn the other cheek.

Again next to consumption and pneumonia no set of diseases is more fatal to Negroes than diseases of the nervous system. Over 30,000 Negroes die from this cause each year.\nAll these figures are from the United States census reports and go to show the ignorance of knowledge which will not learn.\nIt illustrates, too, how silly it is to try and draw great slashing lines of difference between races.

If such persons will consider the news of the month they will easily realize that race prejudice in the United States is a deliberately cultivated and encouraged state of mind. In Chicago that which was heralded the world over as “racial” antipathy and called even a “race war” in an art class was proven to be merely a lie, made by a sensation monger. In Delaware a “mob of Negroes” dissolves itself into the rioting of liquor-soaked white toughs. In Texas, the white city of San Antonio went so wild over the excellence of Negro troops that a demagogue in Congress thought it was time for another Brownsville, and our amiable President hastened to comply—with three contradictory orders in 24 hours. Is it not time that reasonable Americans refuse to be stampeded by nonsense and lies?\nThere is some evidence of awakening on this point. Hysterical schoolgirls at Cornell, who ought to know better than to yield to cheap snobbery, have been quietly but firmly rebuked by the President. In Boston last year certain impudent Southerners stampeded the managing committee of the Boston Floating Hospital into refusing to appoint colored nurses. The result was that this year one white Southern woman and four white Northern women held up the New England Hospital for women and children for daring to admit a colored interne. These chivalrous and devoted ladies threatened to leave the sick and dying to their fate unless the directors yielded; but the directors calmly declared by a vote of 17 to 4 that they proposed to run the hospital themselves. What has been the result? Has the world ended, or the South seceded? Is the “supremacy” of the white race threatened?

We have begun the experiment—we have tried it here and there, but the United States has not to-day, and never has had, a complete rational system of elementary education for its myriads of black and white children, and this fact is perhaps the greatest arraignment of American democracy.\nEducational facilities are not good throughout the North, while in the South they are on the whole, wretched.\nThe Birmingham Age-Herald said editorially in 1910: “About one-third of the children of school age in this State go to school, and two-thirds do not. … This puts Alabama on the Russian basis. … It is safe to say that one-half of the 700,000 children of to-day are not sent to school and are, therefore, growing up without a public school education. It is also safe to say that the school accommodations of this State are not ample enough to care for one-half of the State’s children.” Why in the face of such facts will people insist that education has failed?\nLet us try education and try it on a national scale. Let us have federal aid to common school training, even if it delays our battleships and puts the annual army manœuvres out of business. A statement made a few years ago by the superintendent of education in the Southern States set forth these facts:\n\nComparative statistics of undoubted authority show that of all sections of the United States the public schools of the South have the poorest houses and equipment, the most poorly paid teachers, the shortest school terms, and the most inadequate supervision. The average salary of teachers for the country at large is $49 for men and $40 for women, while the average salary for teachers in the Southern States is $35.63 for men and $30.47 for women. The average length of the public school term for the country at large is 145 days. The average length of the public school term for the North Atlantic States is 177.3 days; the average length of the public school term for the Southern States, including Tennessee, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia, Texas, Virginia and Florida is 99 days.\nFor every woman and child of its population the country at large is spending $2.99 for the education of its children. The South is spending barely 98 cents. The country at large is spending $20.29 for every pupil enrolled in its public schools. The Southern States are spending only $6.95. The country at large is spending for every child of school age in the United States an average of $10.57; the Southern States are spending for every child of school age within their borders $4.05. … Twenty-four per cent, of the white population of the United States dwell in the Southern States that composed the Confederacy, while 64 per cent, of all the white illiterates over 10 years of age are found in these States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEducation (1911)\nEducation (1915)\nNegro Education (1918)\nSegregation (1910)\nReconstruction (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Education.” The Crisis 2\n(2): 62. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/02/02/education.html."

He protested vigorously, as he ought to have done, and brought suit. Now, riding on a Pullman car is social equality and there is no use in pretending that it is not. Equal civil rights are impossible without social equality. Equal political rights are impossible without social equality. When American Negroes recently sent a protest to England complaining of civil and political degradation what did the South retort? Practically all the Southern white papers said this is “demanding social equality;” and it was. Social equality is simply the right to be treated as a gentleman when one is among gentlemen and acts like a gentleman. No person who does not demand such treatment is fit for the society of gentlemen. Of course, what the speaker meant to say was that he had no desire to force his company on people unnecessarily if they objected to him, but such a right does not imply “equality” but “superiority,” and this speaker knows or ought to know that every time a black man says publicly that he is willing to be treated as a social pariah, he is forging the chains of his social slavery.

No attempt was made to follow up this idea for several years; then the Ethical Culture Society permitted one of its best organizers, Gustave Spiller, to devote two years to the organizing of such a congress. It was planned to hold the congress in the summer of 1911. Extraordinary difficulties faced the organizer. He had’ no funds; he had no special clientele to appeal to, and he was embarking upon what large numbers of practical people thought a fanciful, if not an impossible, attempt. Then, too, other people feared and opposed it for political and social reasons. Nevertheless, Mr. Spiller went to work.\nWithin two years he succeeded in enlisting the support of no less than fifty countries, over thirty presidents of parliaments, the majority of the members of the Permanent Court of Arbitration and of the delegates to the Second Hague Conference, twelve British governors and eight British premiers, over forty colonial bishops, some hundred and thirty professors of international law, the leading anthropologists and sociologists, the officers and the majority of the council of the Interparliamentary Union, and other distinguished personages. As writers of papers, Mr. Spiller secured representatives from over twenty civilizations, and every paper referring to a particular people was prepared by some one of high standing belonging to that people.\nAs president of the congress, the Right Honorable Lord Weardale, a well-known figure in the World’s Peace movement, was secured. Among the vice-presidents was the Prime Minister of England, Mr. Balfour, leader of the opposition, Viscount Morley of Blackburn, the speaker of the House of Commons, the Archbishop of York, and others. The general committee included some of the greatest names of the world. On Wednesday, July 26, when Lord Weardale opened the first session of the Congress, he looked into the faces of a thousand people representing fifty different races."

The Executive Committee stated the purpose of the Congress succinctly: “The object of the Congress will be to discuss, in the light of science and the modern conscience, the general relations subsisting between the peoples of the West and those of the East, between so-called white and so-called colored peoples, with a view to encouraging between them a fuller understanding, the most friendly feelings, and a heartier cooperation.” Lord Weardale in his introduction to the volume of papers has enlarged upon this idea: &gt; To those who regard the furtherance of international good will and peace as the highest of all human interest’, the occasion of the First Universal Races Congress opens a vista of almost boundless promise.\n&gt;   &gt; No impartial student of history can deny that in the case of nearly all recorded wars, whatever the ostensible reasons assigned, the underlying cause of conflict has been the existence of race antipathies—using the word race in its broad and popular acceptation—which particular circumstances, often in themselves of trivial moment, have fanned into flame.\n&gt;   &gt; In the earliest times it took the form of one race attempting to subjugate and indeed enslave another; but even in modern wars, while questions of frontier, the ambitions of rulers, or the rivalries of commercial policies, may have provoked the actual crisis, it will be found, in almost every instance, that the pre-existence of social and racial enmity has in reality determined the breach which particular incidents had merely precipitated.\n&gt;   &gt; As civilization progresses and the western world more fully recognizes its ethical responsibilities, it may be hoped that such influences will become an ever diminishing force; but the modern con science has to-day, in addition, other and quite new problems to solve in face of the startling and sudden appearance of new factors in the Eastern Hemisphere.\n&gt;   &gt; In less than twenty years we have witnessed the most remarkable awakening of nations long regarded as sunk in such depths of somnolence as to-be only interesting to the western world because they presented a wide and prolific field for commercial rivalries, often greedy, cruel, and fraught with bloodshed in their prosecution, but which otherwise were an almost negligible quantity in international concerns.\n&gt;   &gt; How great is the change in the lifetime of a single generation, when, to select two instances alone, we contemplate the most remarkable rise of the power of the Empire of Japan, the precursor, it would seem, of a similar revival of the activities and highly developed qualities of the population of the great Empire of China!\n&gt;   &gt; Nearer and nearer we see approaching the day when the caste population of the East will assert their claim to meet on terms of equality the nations of the West, when the free institutions and the organized forces of the one hemisphere will have their counterbalance in the other, when their mental outlook and their social aims will be in principle identical; when, in short, the color prejudice will have vanished and the so-called white races and the so-called colored races shall no longer merely meet in the glowing periods of missionary exposition, but, in very fact, regard one another as in truth men and brothers.\n&gt;   &gt; Are we ready for this change? Have we duly considered all that it signifies, and have we tutored our minds and shaped our policy with a view of successfully meeting the coming flood? It is in order to discuss this question of such supreme importance that the First Universal Races Congress is being held."

    "text": "III.—The Program of the Congress.\nThe program, as laid down, sought first to take up fundamental considerations concerning the meaning of race. Then there followed certain general matters of racial progress like government, political conditions, language, religion and miscegenation. The third session began with the special racial problems in China, Japan, Turkey, Persia, India, Egypt, Haiti, etc. Then the matter of interracial contact was spoken of: first, the economic side, and then the bonds of science, art and technique. The fifth session turned to the question of the social conscience in relation to racial questions, and took up the problems of the Jew, and of the Negro in Africa and America, and also the question of indentured labor and drink. The last two sessions were given up to positive suggestions for permitting interracial friendliness.\nThe really astounding thing about this program was the amount of agreement and sympathy among papers from widely different sources. Seldom has there been an international congress where there was so much unity in the underlying thought and where the enthusiasm for the central idea was so manifest and so well expressed. Of course in the very multiplicity of the problems, and the large number of speakers, there were manifest disadvantages; practically all the speakers were limited to seven minutes, and yet there must have been at least 150 speakers. Then, too, the speeches were in different languages, including a good deal of broken English. The acoustics of the hall were not good and the heat was intense. Under such conditions it would have been natural to have had a large number of people in bad temper and a great many misunderstandings. This, however, was not so, and every one attending the sessions came away with a distinct feeling of uplift and hope."

    "section": "IV.—The Men Who Were There.",
    "text": "IV.—The Men Who Were There.\nThe personnel of the Congress was marvelous. First, there was the natural difference in color, from the jet black of General Légitime, of Haiti, to the blond Germans and Norwegians. The infiltration of Negro blood was particularly noticeable; the two Egyptian Beys were evidently negroid, the Portuguese was without a doubt a mulatto, and the Persian was dark enough to have trouble in the South. Next came the difference in language: English, French, German and Italian were heard and used continually in speeches, in discussion and in conversation. I remember at one dinner party at the beautiful home of Felix Moscheles there were eight people present and they were talking four languages nearly all the time. After all this came the difference of dress and the many other subtle differences of civilizations; the turban, the fez, the ceremonies of greeting, all gave a peculiar picturesqueness to the assembly.\nThe personalities which made the most impression upon me were: Mr. Spiller, the creator of the Congress, the indefatigable worker, unselfish and devoted; Dr. Seal, the Indian scholar, tall and brown, with a flowing white beard, full of simple but wholesome enthusiasm; Watanabe, the Japanese parliamentarian, a sweet-tempered scholar; Rubasana, the only Negro member of the Cape Colony Parliament; Hadji Mirza Yahya, the leader of the Persian revolutionists; General Légitime, of Haiti, and his interesting daughter; the Secretary of State of Liberia. Among the most forceful speakers were the Englishmen Robertson and Hobson, and Mrs. Annie Besant. In the audience at various times were many distinguished persons: Prince Kropotkin, of Russia; Schreiner, of South Africa; Finot, of France; the Prince di Cassano; Israel Zangwill, who was listened to with great attention. Wilberforce University sent four popular persons—President Scarborough, Mr. Finch and Chaplain and Mrs. Steward. To all these one must add a large part of learned and philanthropic London, as, for instance, the Ranee of Sarawak, who is the daughter-in-law of Rajah Brooke; Frederic Harrison, Sir Percy Bunting, since deceased; Travers Buxton, and others."

    "text": "V.—Some of the Papers.\n[Paper abstracts omitted.]\nDr. W. E. B. Du Bois, United States.— The Negroes number about ten millions in the United States. Most of them descend from former slaves. They live at the present time under a system of theoretical liberty, but it is restricted in practice by certain legal dispositions and by custom. They are well disposed toward family life, in so far as they are enabled to enjoy it, and to education. They have churches of their own. About two hundred thousand of them are farmers, and fifty thousand are engaged in commerce and the liberal professions. Their situation is most distressing in the South, where they suffer civic incapacity, injustice in the courts of law, economic restrictions, discourtesy in public, etc. And 75 per cent. of the Negroes live in the South. One theory proposes that they should emancipate themselves by acquiring wealth, but it would seem that intellectual emancipation should proceed hand in hand with economic independence.\n[Paper abstracts omitted.]\nVI.—The Race Problems.\nWhen fifty races look each other in the eye, face to face, there rises a new conception of humanity and its problems. For four days these representatives of the world walked and sat and ate side by side and heard speech after speech. There were few set expository talks. Men did not explain their problems as to some third person—rather they expressed their own inner feeling at this contact of soul. Some objected to this. They said: “There are fine phrases after phrases and endless allusions to human brotherhood, but after all there is little scientific ordered explanation. We find our thoughts and sympathies aroused but unsatisfied.”\nThis was inevitable. To explain means double knowledge: knowledge of the problem, knowledge of the world to whom the problem is being explained. Strangers, therefore, cannot easily reveal themselves to each other and the delegates to the Races Congress were largely strangers.\nYet in the continual meeting of strangers comes gradual illumination and what the formal speeches failed to do, informal intercourse accomplished to a wonderful degree. First, perhaps, the problem of racial and national integrity stepped to the fore: “We built a great wall once,” said the keen Chinese representative, “to keep out the world; a wall so vast that it has been said to be the only work of man capable of being seen from the moon; now you are building a wall against us’—but in either case the clear implication was, China stands and must stand as an independent nation. So with the Turks and the Persians there was a certain frank appeal to the fair judgment of men. We are a congeries of races, said the Turks repeatedly, united in political bonds, and thus we typify the future of the world; and the Persians appealed to a great past as earnest for a greater future. Yet it was significant that while they were speaking Austria was moving all her influence to force European interference in Albania, the ex-Shah landed in Persia and the Times was publishing articles to show England’s neglected interests in the Persian gulf.\nNext to questions of integrity came problems of autonomy among the great subject nations of India and Egypt. How long are these to be held in leading strings? How far can people not “European” govern themselves? How dangerous has been the rise of Japan? The clear unanswerable argument of John Robertson, M.P., was but reason above foaming waters, and one felt the repression of those who talked on these subjects.\nThe next great question discussed, not so much directly as by implication, was that of religion. What right has one religion to discredit another and force itself on men, especially when it does not pretend to practice what it preaches? This was the repeated implication in conversation and speech. It was a hard thing to answer in face of the tolerance of the Mohammedan and the Buddhist. Perhaps its best answer was the Races Congress itself.\nAfter this the questions came nearer home and the color line appeared. Who and what are these black and brow: men? Are they really men? And, in the same breath, is their ability due to white blood or is white blood fatal to them? One could, after all, think one’s way through the political integrity ot the East and the gradual freedom of India and Egypt, but could black men be free—were they worth freedom? The answer from the United States was sharp and strong and perhaps the most arresting thing in the whole Congress. If America is trying to treat civilized men as uncivilized simply on account of color what effect will this have on the world and on Africa?\nAfrica was to the Congress as to the world, the land of the Sphinx. It said little that was articulate, but all knew that it was the land of that new forced and exploited labor on which London and the world waxes luxurious, and that this exploitation is spread over Mexico and South America; is it not one with the economic exploitation of women and children and the mass of laborers generally?\nThe question of the status of women leaped continually to the front. If we speak of China, what of Chinese women? It was the women of India and child marriage that created the keenest interest and no paper was more eagerly listened to than that which told of the up struggling of the Negro women of the United States.\nOn the other hand, the labor question was hardly touched in its main modern phases, although a strong, masterly argument was made to show that the economic foundations of imperialism were as weak as those of the slave barons of the South and as wicked.\nOn the whole the view of the race problems of the world as revealed in the Congress was strongly reassuring; but the reason of this was clear. It was because the men themselves were there. In their, absence a terrible indictment against “lazy” Negroes, “dishonest” Chinese and “incompetent” Asiatics could have been framed; but in the face of gentlemen from various human races of all shades and cultures, the fatal exceptions to sweeping rules of fitness continually occurred. The Southerner from the United States was forced to explain that all Negroes were not like this one; the Englishman was forced to show that Indians, fine as they might be personally, had fearful caste hatreds The wretchedness of the fellaheen had to be balanced against the culture of the Egyptian delegates, and everywhere men found themselves facing old and familiar human problems which but helped to make the essential world humanity plausible It seems no exaggeration to say that few world congresses like this would do more for the unity mankind and reasonable sympathy between races, would do more for the stopping of war, slavery and oppression than any other single movement."

Then they select the appropriate adverbs “always” and “never” to show the impossibility of great change in. such human attitudes within any reasonable time.\nThe trouble with such people is that they have no idea of the active campaign carried on quietly in this country to foment race strife and increase race prejudice in quarters where they would seldom, if ever, appear.\nWe select this week a single instance of this: There is in Massachusetts a sleepy, charming old town called Newburyport. It has a half dozen or so quiet colored folk. It also has a paper called the Herald. There is in Nashville, Tenn., a paper called the Nashville Tennessean and American. These two papers recently had the following editorials00editorials, not articles, mind you:\n(Tennessean-American.

A large majority of them favor the open saloon.

Negroes in both States have supported prohibition in large numbers repeatedly and it is ridiculously untrue that 85 per cent, voted for liquor.\nThis is not the first time that identical editorials have appeared in Southern, Western and New England papers on the Negro problem.

Still this species of murder and lawlessness flourishes blithely. Its sickening details in the last few weeks have been as bad as could be imagined. The cause of this is obvious: a disrespect for law and a growing cheapness of human life. Why should America lose respect for law? Because for years some of its best brains have been striving both in the profession of law and on the bench to show how worthless legislation is and help­ less to accomplish its ends. To cite an instance: The Constitution of the United States, the highest law of the land, says that citizens of the United States cannot be disfranchised on ac­ count of race or color. Yet every schoolboy knows that Negro Americans are disfranchised in large areas of the South for no other reason than race and color. This is but one in­ stance of our laughing at law.\nWhy should America count human life cheap? Because it is cheap. Because it is difficult to punish a rich murderer and extremely difficult for a black suspect to escape lynching. Back of the despising of life lies the con­ tempt for men who live. They are not ends, but means—“hands” for doing my work, “masses” for me to contemplate, “niggers” for me to keep down. Their lives, their hurts, their thoughts and aspirations—what is that to me as long as I live and enjoy and rise? Shall my race be disturbed, my fortune taxed, my world turned upside down because six black men in Florida are murdered or a woman and a child hanged by ruffians at Oklahoma? Nonsense. They are not worth it. They can be bought for fifty cents a day. Thus we despise life.\nThe result is mob and murder. The result is barbarism and cruelty. The result is human hatred.

Finally, repeated appeals for a larger and better high school brought a decision on the part of the Board of Education to enlarge the old school.\nA vigilance committee of six colored men, headed by Charles H. Dodge, was formed and they brought in so strong a petition that the board hesitated. They could not find or afford a site for a new school, they complained. The committee of six found a site, but two small property owners would not yield. The committee of six sat up half the night with them and finally themselves paid the difference in price out of their own pockets.\nThen the white neighbors rose in arms. The newspapers flamed, and meetings were held to keep the Negro schoolhouse out of decent quarters; finally it was planned to seize the proposed site for a park. The matter came to a vote, the Negroes rallied, and the project was defeated. (Does the black man need the ballot?)\nAt last all was arranged when the chairman of the committee of six was told confidentially that the board stood six to six on the project of the new Negro high school, and that unless a certain man was won over all was lost. Dodge went to see the man. The gentleman’s secretary refused him admission. Dodge went to another man and got a letter.

Down on your knees, black men, and hear the tale with awestruck faces: Learn from the Superior Race. We do not trust our own faltering pen and purblind sight to describe the reception of the suffragists at the capital of the land. We quote from the Southern reporters of the Northern press:\n\nFive thousand women, marching in the woman-suffrage pageant yesterday, practically fought their way foot by foot up Pennsylvania Avenue, through a surging mass of humanity that completely defied the Washington police, swamped the marchers, and broke their procession into little companies. The women, trudging stoutly along under great difficulties, were able to complete their march only when troops of cavalry from Fort Myer were rushed into Washington to take charge of Pennsylvania Avenue. No inauguration has ever produced such scenes, which in many instances amounted to little less than riots.\n \nMore than 100 persons, young and old, of both sexes, were crushed and trampled in the uncontrollable crowd in Pennsylvania Avenue yesterday, while two ambulances of the Emergency Hospital came and went constantly for six hours, always impeded and at times actually opposed, so that doctor and driver literally had to fight their way to give succor to the injured.\n \nHoodlums, many of them in uniform, leaned forward till their cigarettes almost touched the women’s faces while blowing smoke in their eyes, and the police said not a word, not even when every kind of insult was hurled.\n \nTo the white-haired women the men shouted continuously: ‘Granny! granny! We came to see chickens, not hens! Go home and sit in the corner!’ To the younger women they yelled: ‘Say, what you going to do to-night? Can’t we make a date?’ and the police only smiled. The rowdies jumped on the running boards of the automobiles and snatched the flags from the elderly women, and they attempted to pull the girls from the floats.\n\nWasn’t it glorious? Does it not make you burn with shame to be a mere black man when such mighty deeds are done by the Leaders of Civilization? Does it not make you “ashamed of your race?” Does is not make you “want to be white?”\nAnd do you know (we are almost ashamed to say it) the Negro again lost a brilliant opportunity to rise in his “imitative” way. Ida Husted Harper says:\n\nWe made the closest observation along the entire line and not in one instance did we hear a colored man make a remark, although there were thousands of them.\n\nAnother white woman writes:\n\nI wish to speak a word in favor of the colored people during the suffrage parade. Not one of them was boisterous or rude as with great, difficulty we passed along the unprotected avenue. The difference between them and those insolent, bold white men was remarkable. They were quiet and respectable and earnest, and seemed sorry for the indignities which were incessantly heaped upon us. There were few policemen to protect us as we made our first parade in Washington, and the dignified silence of the colored people and the sympathy in their faces was a great contrast to those who should have known better. I thank them in the name of all the women for their kindness.\n\nNow look at that! Good Lord! has the Negro no sense? Can he grasp no opportunity?\nBut let him not think to gain by any such tactics. The South sees his game and is busy promoting bills to prevent his marrying any wild-eyed suffragette who may be attracted by his pusillanimous decency. Already the Ohio legislature has been flooded by forged petitions from a “Negro advancement society of New York” to push the intermarriage bill!\nNo, sir! White men are on the firing line, and if they don’t want white women for wives they will at least keep them for prostitutes. Beat them back, keep them down; flatter them, call them “visions of loveliness” and tell them that the place for woman is in the home, even if she hasn’t got a home. If she is homely or poor or made the mistake of being born with brains, and begins to protest at the doll’s house or the bawdy house, kick her and beat her and insult her until in terror she slinks back to her kennel or walks the midnight streets. Don’t give in; don’t give her power; don’t give her a vote whatever you do. Keep the price of women down; make them weak and cheap.\nShall the time ever dawn in this Land of the Brave when a free white American citizen may not buy as many women as his purse permits?

    "section": "",
    "text": "Before another number of The Crisis appears the next President of the United States will have been elected. We have, therefore, but this last word to colored voters and their friends.\nThose who have scanned our advertising pages this month and last have noted an unusual phenomenon: the three great political parties have in this way been appealing to the colored vote for support. They have done this out of no love to this magazine, but because they needed the publicity which this magazine alone could give and because they knew that our news columns and editorial pages were not for sale. We commend these advertisements to our readers’ notice. They are the last word of political appeal and they are undoubtedly sincere.\nTaking them now and comparing and weighing them, and what is the net result? The Republican party emphasizes its past relations with the Negro, the recent appointments to office, and warns against the disfranchisement and caste system of the Democratic South. The weak point in this argument is that without the consent of Republican Presidents, Republican Congresses and a Republican Supreme Court, Southern disfranchisement could not survive a single day.\nThe Progressive party stresses its platform of social reform, so admirable in many respects, and points to the recognition given in its party councils to the Northern Negro voter. The weak point here is the silence over the fact that Theodore Roosevelt, the perpetrator of the Brownsville outrage, has added to that blunder the Chicago disfranchisement and is appealing to the South for white votes on this platform.\nThe Democratic party appeals for colored votes on the ground that other parties have done and are doing precisely the things that the Democratic party is accused of doing against the Negro, and this in spite of the fact that these parties receive the bulk of the Negro vote. If, therefore, the Negro expects Democratic help and support, why does he not give the Democrats his vote? The weak point here is that the invitation is at best negative; the Negro is asked to take a leap in the dark without specific promises as to what protection he may expect after the Democrats are in power.\nIn none of these cases, therefore, is the invitation satisfactory. Nevertheless, because the Socialists, with their manly stand for human rights irrespective of color, are at present out of the calculation, the Negro voter must choose between these three parties. He is asked virtually to vote.\n\nFor a party which has promised and failed.\nFor a party which has failed and promised.\nFor a party which merely promises.\n\nWe sympathize with those faithful old black voters who will always vote the Republican ticket. We respect their fidelity but not their brains. We can understand those who, despite the unspeakable Roosevelt, accept his platform which is broad on all subjects except the greatest—human rights. This we can understand, but we cannot follow.\nWe sincerely believe that even in the face of promises disconcertingly vague, and in the face of the solid caste-ridden South, it is better to elect Woodrow Wilson President of the United States and prove once for all if the Democratic party dares to be Democratic when it comes to black men. It has proven that it can be in many Northern States and cities. Can it be in the nation? We hope so and we are willing to risk a trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Parties (1924)\nPresidential Candidates (1920)\nHow Shall We Vote (1920)\nThe Election (1914)\nMr. Hughes (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “The Last Word in Politics.”\nThe Crisis 5 (1): 184–86. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/05/01/last_word_in_politics.html."

    "title": "The Colored Magazine in America",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The first colored magazine in America seems to have been The African Methodist Episcopal Church Magazine, edited by Dr. Hogarth, general book steward, and published in Brooklyn, in October, 1841. This magazine was in a sense the ancestor of The Crisis. Its editor seems to have been a native of Haiti, although little is known of his life and work. The prospectus of the magazine says: “In embarking upon this laudable enterprise it becomes our duty, in the onset, to inform our friends that such a work cannot be concluded with dignity and honor to our people unless it meets with ample supply of pecuniary and intellectual means. A fear of failure in obtaining these important contingencies had, in a great measure, prevented our brethren in their deliberations from coming to any conclusions on this important subject. But, judging from the present aspect of things, that the times have greatly changed in our favor as a people, light has burst forth upon us, intelligence in a great measure is taking the place of ignorance, especially among the younger portions of our people, opening the avenues to proper Christian feeling and benevolence—our brethren, from those important considerations, came to the conclusion, at our last New York annual conference, held in June, in the city of Brooklyn, to order such a work and lay it before the public for their patronage.” This magazine lasted two or three years. Its publication was then stopped.\nAfter an interval of forty years Bishop B. T. Tanner began the publication of the A. M. E. Church Review Quarterly. This has been published as a quarterly magazine from 1855 down to to-day and is now receiving new life from its recently elected editor, Dr. R. C. Ransom. The first number of the Review says editorially: “My church, the African Methodist Episcopal, at its recent quadrennial session in Baltimore, concluded to have not only a weekly paper, but a Review, for the present quarterly, but intended to be bi-monthly, with the management of which it honored me. I have, therefore, gentlemen, to ask at your hands the same friendly consideration you so generously accorded me when editor of the Christian Recorder. Grant an exchange. Speak a word—when merited. What we present is unique in the world of letters. If you think so, advise the thoughtful of your readers to subscribe for it.”\nA quarterly magazine, however, did not quite fill the bill, and in the years from 1845 to the present there have been a number of other adventures. There was, for instance, The Repository of Religion and Literature, published in Indianapolis and afterward in Baltimore for several years. In later days the Colored American Magazine, started by a colored man who put the savings of his life from days’ labor into it, was first issued in Boston in 1900, and rapidly attained a wide circulation. At its zenith it distributed 15,000 copies. Then, however, its troubles began. It was at one time sold for debt, but Colonel William H. Dupree rescued it, and it seemed about to take on new life when further difficulties occurred. It was suggested to the editor, who was then Miss Pauline Hopkins, that her attitude was not conciliatory enough. As a white friend said: “If you are going to take up the wrongs of your race then you must depend for support absolutely upon your race. For the colored man to-day to attempt to stand up to fight would be like a canary bird facing a bulldog, and an angry one at that.” The final result was that the magazine was bought by friends favorable to the conciliatory attitude, and transferred to New York, where it became so conciliatory, innocuous and uninteresting that it died a peaceful death almost unnoticed by the public.\nMeantime, a firm of subscription-book printers, then known as the J.L. Nichols Company, conceived an idea suggested to it by one of its agents of publishing a colored magazine in the South. The Voice of the Negro appeared in January, 1904, and a young man then just out of college, Mr. J. Max Barber, was made its editor. The Voice of the Negro proved the greatest magazine which the colored people had. It reached a circulation of 15,000, and at one time printed 17,000 copies. It was a magazine of fifty-five pages of reading matter, was illustrated and well edited. The whole story of its final failure has not been written, and perhaps ought not to be for some years to come. Suffice it to say that the fault did not lie with Mr. Barber. The editorial work was well done. The business side, on the other hand, under a succession of men, was not as well attended to; nevertheless, it was not a failure, and the magazine might still be alive had it not been for sinister influences within and without the race that wished either to control or kill it; and finally, had it not been for the Atlanta riot. Mr. Barber found himself continually hampered by interests which were determined to edit his magazine for him. When he asserted his independence these interests appealed to the firm which was backing him and finally so impressed them that they determined to undo the proposition on a new corporation. Stock in the corporation sold slowly, but it was beginning to sell when the instigators of the Atlanta riot drove Mr. Barber from the city. Removing to Chicago, Mr. Barber found himself facing the task of re-establishing his magazine with practically no capital. He made a brave effort, but finally had to give up and The Voice of the Negro ceased publication. Its successor is The Crisis, and it looks as though this latest candidate for popular favor was going to be permanently successful.\n\nThe Crisis Sanctum Sanctorum”\nSince then The Crisis represents so interesting a series of magazines, perhaps a word should be said for its force and dwelling place. As one rides down Broadway, New York, past the tallest building in the world, one comes to the old postoffice on City Hall Park and Park Row, the center of newspaperdom. Vesey Street is the westward extension of Park Row across Broadway. There, opposite the moss-grown graves of St. Paul’s churchyard, rises a brownstone building of the older office design. You come up a long flight of stairs and enter our rooms.\nThe big library and workroom greets you first. From this you pass by the agents and subscription clerks to the two editorial offices or to the offices of the secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and her assistant. Turning the other way you find the cashier in his den and the advertising man, and finally the store and mailing room with their periodicals and machine. The present force of The Crisis consists of an editor, three clerks, a bookkeeper and advertising man, four unpaid editorial assistants and 489 agents in the field.\n\nThe Crisis Business Force—Messrs. Turner and Holsey; Misses Allison, Jarvis and Sousa\nMany persons do not understand the relation of The Crisis to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The association owns and publishes The Crisis and uses the magazine as its special organ of publicity. At the same time it aims to make The Crisis more than a mere bulletin of its work, and to conduct it as a magazine of general information in its sphere. The two institutions make, therefore, parts of one great whole.\nTo no part of its force does The Crisis owe more than to its little army of agents scattered over the world. They sell every month from six to 1,400 copies each. Finally, we cannot forget, and would not have our readers forget, our first paid-up subscriber: Geo. W. Blount, of Hampton Institute, Virginia.\n George Wesley Blount, of Hampton, Va.

    "section": "",
    "text": "That this nation and this world needs is a Renaissance of reverence for the truth. If The Crisis stands for one thing above others, it is emphasis of this fact, and it is here that we have to differ with some of our best friends. We are here to tell the essential facts about the condition of the Negro in the United States. Not all the facts, of course—one can never tell everything about anything. Human communication must always involve some selection and emphasis. Nevertheless. in such selection and emphasis there can be two attitudes as different as the poles. One attitude assumes that the truth ought to be as one person or race wants it and then proceeds to make the facts prove this thesis. The other attitude strives without undue assumption of any kind to show the true implication of the existing facts. The first attitude is that of nearly all the organs of public opinion in the United States on the Negro problem. They have assumed, and for the most part firmly believe, that the Negro is an undesirable race destined to eventual extinction of some kind. Every essential fact and situation is therefore colored and grouped to support this thesis, and when stubborn facts appear that simply will not support this thesis there is almost complete silence.\nFew Americans, many Negroes, do not realize how widespread and dangerous this disregard of truth in relation to the Negro has become and how terrible is its influence. Sir Harry Johnston, a great Englishman, was recently invited to furnish his views on the Negro to a popular American magazine. When these articles were written and seemed favorable to the black man the magazine paid for them and suppressed them. Jane Addams was asked to write on the Progressive party for McClure’s Magazine. Her defense of Negro rights was, with her consent, left out, and appeared in The Crisis last month. Charles Edward Stowe offered his “Religion of Slavery” to the Outlook. It was returned not as untrue but “unwise.”\nMany persons who know these things defend this attitude toward the truth. They say when matters are bad do not emphasize their badness, but seek the encouraging aspects. If the situation of the Negro is difficult strive to better it, but do not continually harp on the difficulties. The trouble with this attitude is that it assumes that everybody knows the truth; that everybody knows the terrible plight of the black man in America. But how do they know it when the organs of public information are dumb? Would anybody ever suspect by reading the Outlook that educated property-holding Negroes are disfranchised? Would any future generation dream by reading the Southern Workman that 5,000 Negroes had been murdered without trial during its existence? What right have we to assume intuitive and perfect knowledge of truth in this one problem, while in myriads of other human problems we bend every energy and strain every nerve to make the truth known to all? Is there not room in the nation for one organ devoted to a fair interpretation of the essential facts concerning the Negro! There certainly is, even if the silence and omissions of the public press were quite unconscious; but how much more is the need when the misrepresentation is deliberate! In the recent Congress of Hygiene in Washington there was sent from Philadelphia a chart alleging in detail the grossest and most unspeakable immorality against the whole Negro race. Colored folk led by F.H.M. Murray protested. The secretary immediately had the offensive lie withdrawn and said: “I am sorry the chart ever found a place there, but I should be more sorry if the colored people had not protested.” Here is the attitude of the honest man: “I am sorry that colored Americans are treated unjustly, but I should be more sorry if they did not let the truth be known.”\nGranted that the duty of chronicling ten mob murders a month, a dozen despicable insults and outrages, is not pleasant occupation, is the unpleasantness the fault of The Crisis or of the nation that perpetrates such dastardly outrages? “Why,” said one of our critics, “if I should tell my white guests of the difficulties, rebuffs and discouragements of colored folk right here in Boston, they would go away and never visit us again. If, however, I tell how nicely the Negroes are getting on. they give money.” Yes! And if your object is money you do right, but if your object is truth, then you should not only tell your visitors the truth but pursue them with it as they run.\nTrue it is that this high duty cannot always be followed. True it is that often we must sit dumb before the golden calf, but is not this the greater call for a voice to cry in the wilderness, for reiterated declaration that the way of the Lord is straight and not a winding, crooked, cunning thing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Statement (1919)\nConduct, Not Color (1916)\nRadicals (1919)\nThe Crisis (1910)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “The Truth.” The Crisis 5\n(2): 76--77. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/05/02/truth.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Grand United Order of Odd Fellows is so large and influential an organization among the colored people of America that its internal affairs are of wide interest. As contrasted with the Elks it represents the original English society, while the white order, the International Order of Odd Fellows, forms the spurious organization. The first lodge was set up by Peter Ogden, a Negro, March 4, 1843. The order had 4,000 members by 1868, and in 1904 reported 286,000. It has to-day 492,905 members. Not only has the order this large membership, but it owns something like two and a half million dollars’ worth of property, and pays out through its subordinate lodges a half million dollars a year in sick and death benefits. It has a central governing body which handles nearly $200,000 a year. It is natural that in an organization like this there should come a severe test of Negro democracy in elections. At the last meeting in Atlanta one man had, on the face of the returns, a majority of votes to elect him grand master. Some of the votes, however, were contested, and back of the effort to contest was a deep and widespread feeling that the candidate was not the proper man to be elected to the position. The result was that his election did not take place and the convention adjourned with the old officers holding over. This was accomplished, however, by adroit and high-handed methods which did not at all savor of democracy. On the other hand, the defeated candidate, contrary to expectation, neither withdrew from the order nor openly rebelled: but, while criticising the methods by which his election was prevented, announced his determination to run again two years hence. Here, then, is a problem of democracy put squarely before the colored people. It is not a new problem, but old as the hills. How, with democratic government, are you going to prevent the election to high office of men whom you think unworthy? There is but one way. Educate the voters. Any other method is dangerous and in the long run suicidal. If the colored Odd Fellows wish the worthiest of their fellows in command over them they must train the rank and file to know what worth is and to select such worth intelligently. But, say many, does not this all prove that if colored men generally voted throughout the South they would make such mistakes as they are making in their own organizations? Of course, it does; of course, they would make mistakes; but human democracy is built on such mistakes. It is only through the training of mistaken action that worthy democratic government can be founded, it is only when the possible mistakes mean utter destruction of government that oligarchy is justifiable. In the present instance there is no such possibility, for even now the colored people in the black belt would vote with some intelligence, and if they had been as zealously trained to citizenship as they have to caste and crime they would be voting as intelligently as any class of workingmen in the republic. Meantime they are beginning their training in democracy in such organizations as the Odd Fellows, and it behooves them to make that training tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOrganization (1915)\nThe Negro Church (1912)\nA Quarter Million (1921)\nA Correspondence (1914)\nDoes Organization Pay?

    "text": "The editor of the Cleveland Gazette names three main points of attack for any national association which aims to help colored people:\n\nDisfranchisement.\nInterstate “Jim Crow”\nLynchings.\n\nThis is perfectly true, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People recognizes this and is straining every nerve to attack these evils. As to disfranchisement we are making every effort to get the proper case before the Supreme Court. We have already helped by briefs and contributions the Oklahoma case, and when it comes before the court we have offered the services of two of the most eminent lawyers in the United States. We are represented on the counsel of the Mississippi “Jim Crow” case; the briefs are being examined by our lawyers, and we are making every effort to get the question before the court in the right way.\nBut the Gazette should know that cases before the Supreme Court are delicate matters. It does not do to rush into court with any haphazard ease. If anyone has a case or knows of a case which will bring out the proper points we should be glad to have it. Theoretically, it would seem very easy to settle such matters. Practically, it is very hard, but we propose to keep at it.\nAs to lynching, there are four things to do: Publish the facts, appeal to the authorities, agitate publicity and employ detectives. Every one of these things we have done. The Crisis publishes the facts monthly over the protest of sensitive readers. We have sent telegrams and appeals to governors, sheriffs and the President; we have held mass meetings: we have sent distinguished writers and: investigators; we have secured publicity in prominent magazines, and we spent thousands of dollars in putting Burns’ detectives on the Coatesville matter.\nWhat else can we do? We want suggestions. Meantime we shall keep up our present agitation.\nSome folk seem to imagine that the walls of caste and prejudice in America will fall at a blast of the trumpet, if the blast be loud enough. Consequently, when an association like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People does something, they say querulously: “But nothing has happened.” They ought to say: Nothing has yet happened, for that is true and that is expected. If in fifty or a hundred years The Crisis can point to a distinct lessening of disfranchisement, and an undoubted reduction of lynching, and more decent traveling accommodations, this will be a great, an enormous accomplishment. Would God all this could be done to-morrow, but this is not humanly possible.\nWhat is possible to-day and tomorrow and every day is to keep up necessary agitation, make unfaltering protest, fill the courts and legislatures and executive chambers, and keep ever lastingly at the work of protest in season and out of season. The weak and silly part of the program of those who deprecate complaint and agitation is that a moment’s let up, a moment’s acquiescence, means a chance for the wolves of prejudice to get at our necks. It is not that we have too many organizations; it is that we have too few effective workers in the great cause of Negro emancipation in America. Let us from this movement join in a frontal attack on disfranchiseemnt, “Jim Crow” cars and lynching. We shall not win today or to-morrow, but some day we shall win if we faint not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSupreme Court (1914)\nA Statement (1919)\nJim Crow (1919)\nThe “Jim Crow” Argument (1913)\nN.A.A.C.P.

    "text": "Few groups of people are forced by their situation into such cruel dilem­mas as American Ne­groes. Nevertheless they must not allow anger or personal resentment to dim their clear vision.\nTake, for instance, the question of the intermarrying of white and black folk; it is a question that colored people sel­dom discuss. It is about the last of the social problems over which they are dis­turbed, because they so seldom face it in fact or in theory. Their problems are problems of work and wages, of the right to vote, of the right to travel decently, of the right to frequent places of pub­ lic amusement, of the right to public security.\nWhite people, on the other hand, for the most part profess to see but one prob­lem: “Do you want your sister to marry a Nigger?”” Sometimes we are led to wonder if they are lying about their solicitude on this point; and if they are not, we are led to ask why under present laws anybody should be compelled to marry any person whom she does not wish to marry?\nThis brings us to the crucial question: so far as the present advisability of intermarrying between white and colored people in the United States is concerned, both races are practically in complete agreement. Colored folk marry colored folk and white marry white, and the exceptions are very few.\nWhy not then stop the exceptions? For three reasons: physical, social and moral.\n\nFor the physical reason that to prohibit such intermarriage would be publicly to acknowledge that black blood is a physical taint—a thing that no decent, self-respecting black man can be asked to admit.\nFor the social reason that if two full-grown responsible human beings of any race and color propose to live to­gether as man and wife, it is only social decency not simply to allow, but to com­pel them to marry. Let those people who have yelled themselves purple in the face over Jack Johnson just sit down and ask themselves this question: Granted that Johnson and Miss Cameron proposed to live together, was it better for them to be legally married or not? We know what the answer of the Bourbon South is. W e know that they would rather uproot the foundations of decent society than to call the consorts of their brothers, sons and fathers their legal wives. We infinitely prefer the methods of Jack Johnson to those of the brother of Governor Mann of Virginia.\nThe moral reason for opposing laws against intermarriage is the greatest of all: such laws leave the colored girl absolutely helpless before the lust of white men. It reduces colored women in the eyes of the law to the position of dogs. Low as the white girl falls, she can compel her seducer to marry her. If it were proposed to take this last defense from poor white working girls, can you not hear the screams of the “white slave” defenders? What have these people to say to laws that propose to create in the United States 5,000,000 women, the ownership of whose bodies no white man is bound to respect?\n\nNote these arguments, my brothers and sisters, and watch your State legislatures. This winter will see a determined attempt to insult and degrade us by such non-intermarriage laws. We must kill them, not because we are anxious to marry white men’s sisters, but because we are determined that white men shall let our sisters alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCorrespondence (1926)\nSeparation (1911)\nColor Caste in the United States (1933)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nInter-Marriage (1924)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “Intermarriage.” The Crisis\n5 (4): 57. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/05/04/intermarriage.html."

    "text": "We should remember that in these days great groups of men are not long oppressed but by their own consent. Oppression costs the oppressor too much if the oppressed stand up and protest. The protest need not be merely physical—the throwing of stones and bullets—if it is mental and spiritual, if it expresses itself in silent, persistent dissatisfaction, the cost to the oppressor is terrific.\nThis fact we continually forget. We say: the South is in saddle; what can we do against twenty millions? The white oppressor rules; of what avail is agitation against ninety millions?\nIf you doubt the efficacy of agitation and protest, ask yourself: Why is the reactionary oligarchic South so afraid of even one protesting voice? Why are the Northern doughfaces, their millionaire backers and their allied teachers in Southern schools so panicstricken at one small voice? Why is the American Negro hater always so anxious to affirm that the Negro assents to his chains and insults, or that the “responsible” Negroes assent, or that the only real Negro leader” assents? Is it because they know that when one protesting voice finds its fellows it may find soon ten millions? And when ten million voices are raised to say:\nDisfranchisement is undemocratic; “Jim Crow” legislation adds insult to theft; “color discrimination is barbarism—”\nWhen ten million voices say this they will, they must, be heard. And when their cause is once heard, its justice will be evident and its triumph sure. Agitate then, brother; protest, reveal the truth and refuse to be silenced. The most damnable canker at the heart of America is her treatment of colored folk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRadicals (1919)\nFreedom of Speech (1930)\nThirteen (1918)\nA Statement (1919)\nForward (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “Our Own Consent.”\nThe Crisis 5 (3): 129. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/05/03/our_own_consent.html."

    "text": "Four men went down the darkened corridor of the Aiken, S. C., jail towards the cell where slept a colored woman. Through the brick and steel structure, there had grown all night a sense of impending terror. Here and there, prisoners unable to sleep with the shadow over them, moved restlessly about their cells, sensing vaguely the form of Tragedy standing nearby.\nBefore the woman’s cell the four men paused. One of them unlocked the door and two others went in and shook the sleeping figure. Bertha Lowman awoke. “What do you want now?” she demanded. The answer was a gruff demand that she get on her clothes and go downstairs. She knew instinctively that something was wrong and refused to go. In nearby cells, other prisoners saw her seized by two of the men and dragged from the iron-barred room.\nDownstairs, Bertha Lowman, her brother, Demon, twenty-two years of age and her fifteen-year-old cousin, Clarence, were taken by the mob numbering between thirty and forty out York Street on the Dixie Highway, past darkened houses and luxuriant flower beds yet untouched by the frost. The cars hurried. On the way, Clarence, knowing what the end of the journey would be, jumped from the car. A shot brought him to the ground, blood pouring from his wound. No tell-tale blood marks must get on the car. A rope was taken from under the rear seat, one end of it was tied to the rear axle of the automobile, the other circled Clarence’s body. The pilgrimage was resumed, the body of the boy bumping ludicrously along the road behind the car.\nA mile and a half from town near an old tourist camp were gathered a thousand people and the two hundred cars which had brought them there. The three Negroes were lined up. The man to whom had been assigned the “honor” of executioner stood sickened by the task before him. He quailed and shook his head. Angrily he was brushed aside and three men took his place with two others aiding.\nThe Negroes were told to run. Off they started. Shots rang out and they fell, the bullets having gone into their backs. The two boys were dead; the woman was not. She thrashed about on the ground begging piteously for life. “She’s bleating like a goat.” One of the mob members laughed derisively as he said it. The sight was too much for some of the mob and they turned their heads away. Others, less tender hearted, fired shot after shot at the squirming figure. At last one bullet found a vital spot. A spasmodic quiver and the body was still.\nThis was the end on October 8th, 1926, of a story which began early in 1925. Sam Lowman and his wife, Annie, were hard working, industrious, law-abiding Christian people. All their lives they had lived in Saluda County with their children, where no member of the family had ever been involved in trouble of any sort. In an effort to better their lot, as the family was miserably poor, Sam Lowman and his wife decided to move to Aiken in 1924. They entered there into negotiations with a white man by the name of William Hartley who had bought the old Stevens place thirteen miles from Aiken. The Lowmans agreed to farm this place on shares. Hartley was a man of considerable wealth measured by the standards of rural South Carolina. He was not a very popular man for, being independently rich, he could and did speak his mind freely. Often these opinions were acrimonious for most of his life Hartley had suffered from nervous indigestion.\nHartley, as was said, had enemies. These sought in many ways to avenge themselves upon him. Early in April, 1925, a crowd of robed and hooded klansmen went to the home of Hartley’s tenants, the Lowmans, called Demon Lowman outside and whipped him severely. Two weeks later, Sheriff H. H. Howard of Aiken received an anonymous letter—at least he said he did. The letter declared that Sam Lowman was selling whiskey. Out to the Lowmans’ house Howard started, taking with him his deputies, Nollie Robinson, A. D. Sheppard and Robert L. McElheney. They did not know where the Lowmans lived except in a general way. Nearing the house, they saw two boys plowing in a field who, when asked, said that the Lowmans lived across the road in the house that could be seen from where the four sheriffs stood. The four white men, clad in civilian clothes, started towards the house. In the back yard, fifty-five-year-old Annie Lowman, the mother, and Bertha were working. Mrs. Annie Lowman was making soap in an iron pot; Bertha was sweeping the yard with a home-made brush broom. Bertha looked up and saw the four men approaching. Through her mind flashed the terror of the Sunday night two weeks before when other white men had come to their home. Softly she spoke to her mother who agreed with her that it was wisest to go inside the house until the white men had gone by.\nThe white men saw them. They drew their revolvers and started running towards the house to surround it. Sheriff Howard and Bertha Lowman reached the back steps at the same time. Pistol in right hand, the sheriff struck Bertha Lowman in the mouth with the back of his left and ordered her to “stand back!.” Mrs. Lowman saw her daughter being struck and heard her scream. Older and slower, she had not had time to escape into the house. She picked up an axe and started to her daughter’s assistance. Deputy Sheriff Nollie Robinson emptied his gun into her body and she crumpled into an inert and lifeless heap.\nDemon and Clarence Lowman heard their sister’s cry of pain and fright and ran towards the house. Demon got a revolver and Clarence a shot gun. The two deputies at the front of the house started firing at Demon and he returned the fire. No one ever knew exactly what Clarence did. In a few seconds, however, the sheriff was dead, Bertha was shot twice through the left breast just above the heart and once through the left abdomen, Clarence was gravely wounded, and Demon was shot in a less vital spot.\nFive of the Lowmans were arrested and placed in the Aiken jail. Sam Lowman, away at the mill having meal ground when the shooting took place, came home later in the day to find himself a widower and four of his children and a nephew in jail. Three days later, three-fourths of a quart of liquor was found buried in the yard of the Lowman home. Sam Lowman was sentenced to two years on the chain gang. Rumors spread around the town that the Klan was going to lynch the Lowman children. Bertha and Clarence were near death from their wounds, but all five of them were rushed away to the penitentiary at Columbia to escape the impending lynching.\nThe shooting took place on April 25, 1925. Howard’s funeral on April 26th was a huge affair at which some two hundred members of the Ku Klux Klan in full regalia participated. An inquest was held on the 27th. Court convened and the Lowmans were indicted on May 4th. Arraignment took place on May 9th. The trial began on May 12th. Judge H. F. Rice, presiding, assigned attorneys to defend the prisoners. The courtroom atmosphere was tense. The crowd was in an ugly mood. Defense attorneys went through the motions of a trial. Not a soul but knew what the verdict would be. The farcical trial nearly over, Judge Rice arose to charge the jury. First he entered into a long eulogy of the deceased sheriff. Then he apologized for the defense attorneys to the jury: Don’t hold it against them because they defended these Negroes, he said in effect. They were ordered by the Court to take the case; the ethics of their profession force them to defend a man when the courts assign them such a task “None of them wanted to do it,” was the final plea.\nOnly one verdict could have been expected after such a trial and such a charge to the jury. Demon and Clarence Lowman were found guilty of murder and sentenced to die on June 12th. Bertha was found guilty of murder with the recommendation of mercy. Life imprisonment was her penance.\nIn Columbia there lives a brave, intelligent and well prepared Negro lawyer, N. J. Frederick by name. He had read of the case in the newspapers and his every sensibility was shocked by the travesty of such a trial. Mr. Frederick looked into the record and was further amazed. He could not rest until he had filed with the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina a bill of exceptions. The execution of the two Lowmans was held up. In November, Mr. Fdererick argued the case before the Supreme Court.\nMonth after month went by with no word from the Court. On April 25, 1926, the anniversary of the death of the sheriff, the Ku Klux Klan held a great celebration in the little Graniteville cemetery. The Col umbia State said there were 1500 people present. Others who were there estimated the crowd between four and five thousand. Free lemonade and lunches were served, eulogies to the late sheriff were uttered and a Klan cross of flowers placed on his grave. All this while the Supreme Court of the State was passing upon the legality of the trial of those accused of conspiring to cause the death of the late sheriff.\nTwo days later the decision was handed down. The conviction was set aside and new trials ordered. Mildly the Supreme Court rebuked Judge Rice for his unethical hostility to the prisoners before him in the first trial.\nOctober came and a new term of court. Mr. Frederick was there and with him L. G. Southard, a white lawyer from Spartanburg whose father and grandfather were Confederate veterans and one of them a general in the Confederate Army.\nAlert, intelligent, courageous were the two of them. They hammered away at the case which the State had prepared against the prisoners. Time and again the State tried to re-inject into the trial that there had been a conspiracy to murder the sheriff even though the Supreme Court’s decision had said definitely that there was no evidence whatever establishing the fact that the three had conspired together to do murder. Every time the State attempted to reinject this issue which had been settled, Frederick and Southard blocked their attempts. The testimony of witness after witness showed that the sheriff and his deputies had never notified the Lowmans in any manner that they were officers of the law. The balance swung the other way until Mr. Southard argued that the criminals in the case were the sheriffs; that they were trespassers upon the property of a peaceable, law-abiding family; that, “a man’s home being his castle,” the Lowmans had every legal and human right to repel invaders of that home.\nOn the afternoon of October 7th, a motion was made to Judge Lanhan, presiding, for a directed verdict of “not guilty” for the three defendants since the State had clearly failed to make out a case of conspiracy to commit murder against them. Judge Lanham took the matter under advisement. At five o’clock, he announced his decision. The motion for a directed verdict for Demon Lowman was granted. The motion for such a ruling in Bertha and Clarence Lowman’s cases was denied. Demon Lowman was immediately re-arrested on a charge of assault and battery with intent to kill; a little knot of men sitting in the back of the dingy court, who had eagerly followed the trial, got up and hastily left the court house.\nAll arrangements had been made to remove the prisoners hastily if they were convicted. The murder charge against one dismissed and the other two certain to be freed if there was the slightest atom of decency and fair play in the minds of the twelve jurors, the plans were abandoned for some unexplained reason. They were taken back to jail and one man left there to guard them.\nOut of the courtroom streamed the crowd. Here and there men detached themselves from the clusters of talkers and went to the office of a lawyer who a month before had been elected to the South Carolina State Legislature. And every man who met in that office was a member of the Ku Klux Klan! In this office, plans were hastily made. Telephone calls went out to Columbia, to Warrenville, to Graniteville, to Bath and other towns all over the State.\nAn hour after Judge Lanham delivered his decision, a white man in Columbia was talking to his lawyer, also white.\n“I am sorry,” the client said, rising, “but I will have to finish talking this over with you some other time.”\n“What’s your hurry?” the lawyer asked.\n“Got to go over to Aiken right away.”\n“What’s going to happen there and why are you in such a hurry?”\n“They are going to lynch three niggers over there tonight. Don’t you want to come along?” …\nIt was a few days later that I reached South Carolina. In some of the towns where I went tracing information, gathering clues, they said to me, “Don’t go to Aiken! If you do go, I wouldn’t insure your life for a nickel.”\nBut Aiken is not all bad. I talked with men of character, of distinction, who bitterly, though privately, denounced the lynching and the lynchers.\nOne afternoon when the sun had almost set, I drove along a lonely road with one of these men. We went to the house of a man whom we knew could give us valuable information. I was introduced as the representative of a New York daily newspaper.\n“What does your paper want, Mr. White? The story of this lynching or of the Ku Klux Klan, or both?”\n“Both,” I answered, “but particularly the Klan’s connection with the lynching.”\n“Wait a minute,” he told me and he left me in the room. Two minutes later, the door through which he had gone opened again. I was reading a document he had given me and from that paper I looked up. There stood a man in the full regalia of the Ku Klux Klan!\n“I show you this,” he said to me, “so that you may know what I tell you about the Klan is authentic.”\nBack and forth through the mill towns owned by the Graniteville Manufacturing Company whose mills are large and prosperous through the use of under-nourished, play-deprived white boys and girls and their parents, we rode. A bit of information here and there and corroborative evidence poured in confirming details which at first seemed too horrible for belief. Tales of desperate gangs of moonshiners; tales of floggings and of murders of white men and women as well as of Negroes; the tale of William Hartley, (on whose land the Lowmans lived), wealthy, influential, but driven away from his home and forced to take refuge with a son-in-law when he dared condemn the way the Lowmains had been treated; the tales of postmasters who are members of the Klan and who open the mails of persons known to oppose the Klan; pitiful tales of exploitation of child labor; tales so horrible that the faint voices of the few who oppose the lawless regime make the picture seem all the blacker.\nAll these stories were woven together and the story of the murder of the Lowmans corroborated in every detail. Back in New York, I sent a seven-page letter to Governor Thomas G. McLeod of South Carolina. Sheriffs, deputy sheriffs, policemen, lawyers, members of the South Carolina Legislature, relatives of the Governor—all these together with their names, addresses, occupations, were furnished the Governor as being members of the mob. The names and addresses, too, of responsible white citizens, as well as colored, who knew these facts to be true, were offered to the Governor if he would guarantee them protection from the vengeance of the mob. The Governor was told how in his own State after the lynching, an attempt was made to manufacture a race riot to cover the guilt of the murderers. Agents of the Klan went around Aiken and the neighboring towns saying, “The niggers are armed; they are going to rise in the night and kill all the white people.” The Governor was told how the mob even planned to castrate Lawyer Southard and to tar and feather Lawyer Frederick for daring to defend the Lowmans and to do it well. All these things were told him. Not yet do we know whether any action will come of it. The Grand Jury which investigated the lynching and one of whose members is known to have been a member of the mob and another strongly suspected of having been in it, has reported, strangely enough, that no evidence whatever could be found against any of the lynchers. Governor McLeod, as many citizens of his State told me, is a very weak man. He is a “pussy-footer” they say, who is always quoting the scriptures. He will do nothing.\nThe Governor has the authority under the law to offer a reward for the apprehension of the lynchers. The Lowmans were lynched on October 8th. When I left South Carolina on October 25th, he had offered no reward even though, conditions being what they are, there would be little likelihood of the State ever being forced to pay this sum.\nBut three more names have been added to the black roll of victims of mob murder. White people in South Carolina have learned that they have sown the dragon’s teeth. Man after man of them, respectable, respected, law-abiding, are today living in fear of their lives. The seeds of lawlessness have been sown when black men were lynched and nothing done about it. Today white men are suffering and white women too. And I heard in South Carolina a new note. “We have been opposed to the Dyer Anti-lynching Bill but we realize now that the only hope lies in Federal action. For a time the states would not end lynching. Now the states of the South cannot.”\n(All of the documents obtained by Mr. White were turned over to the New York World and formed the basis of its exposé of the lynching situation in South Carolina.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Newest South (1913)\nAnarchism (1912)\nDeception (1916)\nA Moral Void (1917)\nScottsboro (1934)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nWalter, White. 1926. “The Shambles of South Carolina.”\nThe Crisis 33 (2): 72–75. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/33/02/shambles_of_south_carolina.html."

    "text": "Carl Van Vechten’s “Nigger Heaven” is a blow in the face. It is an affront to the hospitality of black folk and to the intelligence of white. First, as to its title: my objection is based on no provincial dislike of the nickname. “Nigger” is an English word of wide use and definite connotation. As employed by Conrad, Sheldon, Allen and even Firbanks, its use was justifiable. But the phrase, “Nigger Heaven,” as applied to Harlem is a misnomer, “Nigger Heaven” does not mean, as Van Vechten once or twice intimates, (pages 15, 199) a haven for Negroes—a city of refuge for dark and tired souls; it means in common parlance, a nasty, sordid corner into which black folk are herded, and yet a place which they in crass ignorance are fools enough to enjoy. Harlem is no such place as that, and no one knows this better than Carl Van Vechten.\nBut after all, a title is only a title, and a book must be judged eventually by its fidelity to truth and its artistic merit. I find this novel neither truthful nor artistic. It is not a true picture of Harlem life, even allowing for some justifiable impressionistic exaggeration. It is a caricature. It is worse than untruth because it is a mass of half-truths. Probably some time and somewhere in Harlem every incident of the book has happened; and yet the resultant picture built out of these parts is ludicrously out of focus and undeniably misleading.\nThe author counts among his friends numbers of Negroes of all classes. He is an authority on dives and cabarets. But he masses this knowledge without rule or reason and seeks to express all of Harlem life in its cabarets. To him the black cabaret is Harlem; around it all his characters gravitate. Here is their stage of action. Such a theory of Harlem is nonsense. The overwhelming majority of black folk there never go to cabarets. The average colored man in Harlem is an everyday laborer, attending church, lodge and movie and as conservative and as conventional as ordinary working folk everywhere.\nSomething they have which is racial, something distinctively Negroid can be found; but it is expressed by subtle, almost delicate nuance, and not by the wildly, barbaric drunken orgy in whose details Van Vechten revels. There is laughter, color and spontaneity at Harlem’s core, but in the current cabaret, financed and supported largely by white New York, this core is so overlaid and enwrapped with cheaper stuff that no one but a fool could mistake it for the genuine exhibition of the spirit of the people.\nTo all this the author has a right to reply that even if the title is an unhappy catch-phrase for penny purposes and his picture of truth untruthful, that his book has a right to be judged primarily as a work of art. Does it please? Does it entertain? Is it a good and human story? In my opinion it is not; and I am one who likes stories and I do not insist that they be written solely for my point of view. “Nigger Heaven” is to me an astonishing and wearisome hodgepodge of laboriously stated facts, quotations and expressions, illuminated here and there with something that comes near to being nothing but cheap melodrama. Real human feelings are laughed at. Love is degraded. The love of Byron and Mary is stark cruelty and that of Lasca and Byron is simply nasty. Compare this slum picture with Porgy. In his degradation, Porgy is human and interesting. But in “Nigger Heaven” there is not a single loveable character. There is scarcely a generous impulse or a beautiful ideal. The characters are singularly wooden and inhuman. Van Vechten is not the great artist who with remorseless scalpel probes the awful depths of life. To him there are no depths. It is the surface mud he slops about in. His women’s bodies have no souls; no children palpitate upon his hands; he has never looked upon his dead with bitter tears. Life to him is just one damned orgy after another, with hate, hurt, gin and sadism.\nBoth Langston Hughes and Carl Van Vechten know Harlem cabarets; but it is Hughes who whispers\n\n\nOne said he heard the jazz band sob\n\n\nWhen the little dawn was grey.\n\n\nVan Vechten never heard a sob in a cabaret. All he hears is noise and brawling. Again and again with singular lack of invention he reverts to the same climax of two creatures tearing and scratching over “mah man”; lost souls who once had women’s bodies; and to Van Vechten this spells comedy, not tragedy.\nI seem to see that Mr. Van Vechten began a good tale with the promising figure of Anatol, but that he keeps turning aside to write in from his notebook every fact he has heard about Negroes and their problems; singularly irrelevant quotations, Haitian history, Chesnutt’s novels, race-poetry, “blues” written by white folk. Into this mass he drops characters which are in most cases thin disguises; and those who know the originals have only to compare their life and this death, to realize the failure in truth and human interest. The final climax is an utterly senseless murder which appears without preparation or reason from the clouds.\nI cannot for the life of me see in this work either sincerity or art, deep thought, or truthful industry. It seems to me that Mr. Van Vechten tried to do something bizarre and he certainly succeeded. I read “Nigger Heaven” and read it through because I had to. But I advise others who are impelled by a sense of duty or curiosity to drop the book gently in the grate and to try the Police Gazette. –W. E. B.

On the other hand, the worst moral dyspepsia must face facts; and looking back on the history of the Negro race in America for the last few years one cannot help feeling a sense of tremendous encouragement.\nThe legal defense of black men instead of being sporadic and occasional is taking definite, determined form and it is becoming increasingly difficult to cheat and oppress and mob colored people simply because they are colored.\nBut this, after all, is merely negative. Yet on the positive side there is even greater cause for self-congratulation. There is a new self-assertion which is not merely empty impudence. Quietly and unswervingly Negroes have laid down the law that their higher institutions of learning can no longer be run regardless of colored folks’ ideals and desires. Again Negroes have begun to undertake their own self-interpretation and are no longer content merely to sit by, smiling delightedly when some white outsider carelessly evaluates their history, their songs, their hopes, their personal appearance.\nFollowing a rather sudden, almost hysterical renaissance of art among them, there is slowly coming a determined Will-to-Create. Self-expression wells up among us. Even though it is not all of the highest order and often lacks careful finish, it is nevertheless a true and sincere mirroring of new souls and valuable because of its sincerity and newness.\nIn the economic field one senses in every part of the country better home life, larger incomes and more careful spending. The old ideal of imitating the extravagance of the rich whites has not altogether passed but it is evidently passing. One finds little homes of cultured colored folk who are quite willing to admit that they are living on one hundred dollars a month and really living. Children are crowding into high schools and colleges not simply because it is the thing to do, but because their parents are getting clear ideas of just what education is for. There is a small new army of colored artisans who know the technique of their work and the labor movement. And finally, in the dull brain of white America, it is beginning to become clearly evident that the most virile future force in this land, certainly in art, probably in economics and possibly in science, is the Negro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOptimism (1929)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\nCounsels of Despair (1934)\nFraud and Imitation (1912)\nThe White Church (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Optimism.” The Crisis 33\n(4): 182–83. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/33/04/optimism.html."

    "text": "There were thirty-four lynchings in the United States in 1926, nearly twice as many as in 1925.\nThere is no doubt as to the reason of the increase. The fear of the Dyer Bill has been removed from the minds of the murderers. This is but a louder call for Federal legislation. There is no civilized country on earth which would allow in one year thirty-four mob murders to occur without even investigation in most cases and in no case with adequate attempt at punishment. Even the recent imprisonment of Georgia lynchers is not a real case in point, because the man lynched was white. If he had been a Negro these lynchers in jail probability would have gone scot-free.\nThe Nation, therefore, is fronted by a situation. Certain parts of the land are so dominated by their uncivilized elements that they cannot punish murder. There never was any excuse for lynching in group hysteria from “unusual” crime but today this is not even alleged. The case is simply, as in Aiken, the inability of the law to function. What shall a nation do in such case? Sit still and recount the certainly encouraging fact that at least the newspapers are “speaking out”? Or see that the strong hand of the Federal government falls upon the community that will not or cannot punish mob murder?\nSenator Borah writes to warn us that the Dyer Bill was only a political trick and hopelessly unconstitutional. Very good. Why do not Senator Borah and the other decent men in Congress unite to frame a bill that will be constitutional? It is sheer nonsense to allege that a great country like the United States cannot stop wholesale murder because of petty legal technicalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLynching (1914)\nCrime and Lynching (1912)\nLynchings (1932)\nLynching (1926)\nLynchings and Mobs (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Lynching.” The Crisis 33\n(4): 180–81. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/33/04/lynching.html."

    "text": "Some assiduous friends have recalled the remark of a white secretary when he left the N.A.A.C.P. voicing serious doubts as to our methods. There has long been and long will be controversy over the stand which the N.A.A.C.P. has taken. There are those who still believe that our rights as American citizens can be won by cajoling and kow-towing and by the various methods of the so called “white-folks nigger.”\nIt is not, on the other hand, to be supposed that the N.A.A.C.P. is doing aimless and ill-considered fighting. First of all, it is untrue that our officers reside in a “safety zone” and “dictate” to the black South. Walter White did not dictate to Aiken from New York. He went to Aiken and risked life and limb in so doing. During the present year our officers have visited and spoken in Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, New Mexico, Arizona, Tennessee, West Virginia and Missouri. During the last five years there is not a single Southern state that our Secretaries have not visited and most of them repeatedly. Not only that, but the N.A.A.C.P. took its whole paraphernalia and went down to Georgia in 1920 and held its annual conference. And it said in Atlanta exactly the same sort of thing which it said last year in Chicago. The editor of The Crisis in the last ten years has lectured in Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma.\nThe N.A.A.C.P. has always cooperated with other agencies, be they radical or conservative, white or black, Northern or Southern. It has, for instance, repeatedly cooperated with Monroe Trotter and the Equal Rights League, financially and otherwise.\nThe N.A.A.C.P. has attacked the white people of the South and as long as they are responsible for lynching and disfranchisement and Jim Crowism, it is going to continue to attack them. But far from the fact that its outspoken methods have made the relations between the races worse in the South, there is testimony from the South itself that race relations have been steadily improving since 1910 when we began our work; and we maintain that they have been improving because the Negroes have been increasing and reiterating their demands for treatment as men.\nAgain we have been accused of selecting “notorious” cases for defense. This is putting the cart before the horse. Cases become notorious because we select them. Aiken got on the front pages of the newspapers because we put it there. The Sweet case never would have been heard of by most of the country if we had not hired Clarence Darrow and flooded the land with propaganda. The East St. Louis riots would have been hushed up if America had been able to hush up the N.A.A.C.P.\nThe great majority of the persons we have defended have been ordinary working people like the twelve peons in Arkansas; but we have never refused help just because the victim was educated, decent and practicing a profession.\nIt has been charged that the management of the N.A.A.C.P. is undemocratic. If by this is meant that it is impossible for any temporary mob to turn our work up-side-down in fifteen minutes of yelling, this is perfectly true. On the other hand, each member of this organization has a full and effective voice in the conduct of the organization. The members of the Board of Directors are elected at an annual meeting at which every member has a right to vote. Nominations to the Board can be made by anybody who wishes. The Board of Directors thus elected appoints the Executive Officers. This is the method pursued by practically every organization which is permanently effective.\nFinally some people who find pleasure and profit in opposing the officers of the N.A.A.C.P. get very much up-set if these same officers answer attacks in words just as sharp as those of the attacking parties; but surely all this is a matter of taste. If a man calls me a thief there are various kinds of answers recommended by human experience. But certainly pained surprise is the last attitude for the accuser to take if I reply that the gentleman looks to me distinctly like a liar. The facts of the case however are what the public is really interested in and these facts are clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWhite Co-Workers (1920)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nAllies (1911)\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nOfficers (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Our Methods.” The Crisis 33\n(3): 129–30. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/33/03/our_methods.html."

    "text": "There has been developed in the United States a regular technique in matters of mob violence. Matters move somewhat as follows:\nA crime is committed. The police hasten to accuse a Negro. This, of course, is popular because the white public readily believes in Negro crime. A Negro is arrested. If he is promptly lynched the police are vindicated and the guilty white persons saved from fear of detection. If lynching is delayed but threatened a mob usually attacks the Negro district. This gives a chance for looting and stealing. If any Negroes defend themselves, immediately the police, often assisted by the militia, promptly disarm all Negroes and charge a number with rioting. If any white people are arrested for rioting nearly all of them are discharged; but the Negroes are held and prosecuted. This serves to intimidate the Negro population and keeps it from attempting any self-defense, however innocent the defenders may be, and in no matter how grave danger to life, limb and property.\nThe result of all this is to mystify and mislead the public. By the time that the rioting is over, they are under the impression that the Negroes were partially responsible for starting the trouble and that they were armed and conspiring to kill innocent white people. Thus aggression against Negro Americans becomes an exciting form of sport for the lower order of white folk, in which they have practically nothing to lose and little to fear.\nThe technique of this procedure is, of course, taken from the acts of England and other countries in dealing with their colonies. Whenever the natives are subdued or punished and compelled to bow to the will of white folk, the explanation is that the natives were the aggressors; that the Colonial Power was acting in self-defense and that civilization was in danger.\nThe only solution to this kind of problem is not simply to permit but to encourage Negroes to keep and use arms in defense against lynchers and mobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCrime (1920)\nLynchings and Mobs (1921)\nCoffeeville, Kanasas (1927)\nThe Old Story (1911)\nCowardice (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Mob Tactics.” The Crisis 34\n(6): 204. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/34/06/mob_tactics.html."

    "title": "Wallace Battle, the Episcopal Church and Mississippi: A Story of Suppressed Truth",
    "section": "",
    "text": "May 20, 1925, was commencement day at Okolona Institute. This is a colored school, supported by the Episcopal Church, in northeastern Mississippi, in and near a small Mississippi town of four thousand inhabitants. The plant is valued at about a quarter of a million dollars and the school has been established twenty-five years. The Governor of the state, H. L. Whitfield, was expected to speak on this occasion. The Episcopal Bishop of Mississippi was to be present and many white and colored notables.\nEarly in the morning, Ulysses S. Baskin, a graduate of the school and of Tuskegee, a world war veteran and for seven years superintendent of mechanical industries, was milking in the pasture ten rods from his home. He saw a white man looking about the pasture, who quickly disappeared. After he had turned his cow back to the pasture and started home, two white men, H. Anderson and his son, came from behind the trees and told him to stop. They asked if he knew anything about the killing of their dog. Mr. Baskin replied that a week before, three dogs had gotten into the pasture and killed a goat. He had shot at the dogs and killed one. The men said that they did not want an explanation; that they wanted to know if he killed the dog. Baskin repeated his story saying he did not know whose dogs they were, but if they were theirs he was ready to adjust the matter to their satisfaction. Immediately the two men shot him eight times, on the side of the head and in Baskin’s left thigh. All this was plainly seen by two colored men, by Baskin’s wife and by several visitors and teachers at the superintendent’s house. The superintendent lived two days after he was shot and then died leaving a widow, three children and a fourth born after his death. The Andersons took the pistol which they found on him with them and went home.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThere seems to be no dispute about the above facts. They have been well known to the authorities of the Episcopal Church and to the trustees of the school. The story of the conversation is from Baskin’s antemortem statement. Of his death from the gun shot wounds by the Andersons there is no question.\nWallace Battle, founder and principal of the school, demanded the arrest of the Andersons. The Grand Jury was about to adjourn, but was held over for a day and the Andersons were arraigned before it. Not a single witness appeared against them. The only witnesses at the trial were the Andersons themselves. Their story was that when they asked Baskin about their dog, he drew a revolver and shot at them twice and that they killed him in self-defense. They had handed Baskin’s revolver with two cartridges exploded to the chief of police after the murder. They were freed and have not been arrested since.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWallace Battle has at various times and in various places declared that the above facts are by no means the whole of the story; that the Andersons had a bad reputation and had been in shooting scrapes before and had at least one other murder to their credit; that there were witnesses to the murder of Baskin, colored and white, but that the mob spirit was such in the town, and the feeling against a school for Negroes so strong, that these witnesses dare not testify; that the shooting was a merciless assassination for which no possible excuse could be given; that after the elder Anderson had shot this teacher to death he took from Baskin’s pocket a revolver from which no shells had been fired, carried it into the Anderson’s garden and within the sight of a white lady, fired two shots so as to make it appear that their story of self-defense was creditable.\nMr. Battle declares that for some time he had seen the mob spirit forming in Okolona. He believes that seventy-five per cent of the white people of the town and vicinity are his firm friends. Many white people say that Battle was the best loved Negro in Mississippi. White Mississippians have given money to the school; have acted upon the Board of Trustees; and have on many occasions, protected the institution.\nBut these friends find themselves helpless apparently before the other twenty-five per cent, consisting of some poor, illiterate whites, some rich men, some preachers and politicians who were determined the school should go. Mr. Battle declares that twice recently his own life has been threatened and that once he strongly suspected an effort to burn down the school. With his wife and family he was once waylayed in August, 1924, by an automobile full of white men who went by him at great speed and then blocked his road. He escaped by backing his car and fleeing to his campus at the rate of fifty miles an hour. Two weeks later, on a public street opposite the post office, this same H. Anderson stopped Battle and threatened to kill him if he approached the mayor about the case of a Negro whom Anderson had nearly beaten to death. Battle offered to prove that he had said nothing to the mayor about the matter by going with Anderson to the mayor. He afterward tried to get the trustees to take up the matter, but they thought it best to let it die down.\nIn March, white Mississippi ladies planted two magnolias on the highway in front of the campus. In May these magnolias were pulled down and one of the gate posts of the campus injured. On Tuesday night, May 19, just before commencement the water supply of the school was cut off. Then came the tragedy of commencement day.\nWallace Battle, the principal of the school, declared that if these murderers were to go unpunished or if at least they were not compelled to leave town, he could not continue to remain as head of Okolona Institute.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo realize just what this statement meant, one must know something of Wallace Battle. To American Negroes, Battle represents the extreme type of the so-called “white folk’s nigger”; but he was undoubtedly sincere about it. He believed in Southern white people; he believed that their hearts were in the right place; he believed that if a Negro tried hard and did his duty he had nothing to fear from the Southern mob; or if he was threatened with mob violence and had the right sort of reputation and friends that the good white people would come to his defense. Battle thought that he had proven his thesis by establishing and maintaining the school at Okolona. There was bitter opposition at first against such a Negro school, but it had been overcome and few colored men stood so high in any Southern community as Wallace Battle. He was a clean, honest, sincere man, but Negroes considered him lacking in backbone and self-assertion. They accused him of going out of his way to condemn black men who stood up for manhood rights and to excuse the South on every occasion. Battle was one of those who criticized the Booker Washington luncheon at the White House and recently condemned Tuskegee for her determination to maintain the great Government hospital with black employees. Battle certainly served the white people well and in turn they helped him.\nTo Battle this sudden and wanton murder of his friend and employee came as a terrible blow. He demanded justice and confidently expected it. He expected the best elements of the white community and the whole church to stand back of the demand that these murderers be arrested and punished. When this seemed improbable he demanded that at least public opinion should compel their withdrawal from the community and when slowly it began to dawn upon him that nothing was going to be done, he declared that if this were the case he could no longer serve as principal of Okolona.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn the meantime, it looked as though the church was up in arms about this outrage. Prominent officials considered this murder as not simply the killing of an individual, but as a wanton affront to the Episcopal Church, to education and to civilization in Mississippi. They determined to demand redress. If it was impossible to secure the legal punishment of the Andersons it was proposed that the church make an open and clear appeal to the civilized world. They determined to ask the white president of the Board of Trustees, Captain A. T. Stovall of Okolona, to arrange for a mass meeting of the citizens of Okolona so that representatives of the church and of the school could lay the matter frankly before them and ask them to take action. Beyond this, they proposed to appeal to the whole church. It happened that the General Convention of the Episcopal Church was to be held in New Orleans in the fall of 1925. The argument for bringing the convention to New Orleans was that the North and West would thus be able to learn more of the South. Wallace Battle was on the program to speak of educational efforts among Negroes. It was proposed that Mr. Battle tell the church and the world the story of the murder of Baskin by the Andersons and of the failure of the state of Mississippi to punish the murderers.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFurther than this, friends of Okolona and of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People appealed to the Association to take legal steps. One distinguished citizen of Philadelphia wrote: “In my judgment the only way to stop such horrible outrages . . . is by sending a resolute and trained man or woman to the spot getting the evidence and then trying to secure convictions, to be followed by the infliction of extreme penalty of the law. We could not have better cases to work upen. If you take up these cases with the same vigor and discretion that you showed in other like cases you will probably put a stop forever to such lynchings. I have, unfortunately, no money to spare, but I will help you in any other way I can. I think you and your organization are doing a splendid and much needed work. I would not for a moment consider that time-serving X—– of the Okolona School. I have letters from Superintendent Battle that will start you finely in your God-given work at any rate.”\nOur legal committee began to look into the matter when suddenly they received another letter from Philadelphia saying that: “It is urged that any airing of such a matter would immediately bring down upon the colored people who run this school the wrath of the surrounding white neighbors. When I wrote to Mr. Battle asking him why he had not fulfilled his promise I learned from him that his Board of Trustees had refused to allow him to say anything in the matter.”\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMeantime, what had happened? The officers of the Church Institute had set forth their plan of protest and publicity. The Bishop of Mississippi and the Presiding Bishop of the Church had consented to it. Many others had expressed strong sympathy, but Captain Stovall of Okolona had strongly disagreed. He refused to call the local meeting but arranged for a meeting at Memphis where the Bishop of Mississippi, Mr. Bolton Smith, Mr. Wallace Battle and others were present. Captain Stovall insisted that this was not a clear case of race hatred or of enmity to the school; that Baskin was armed; that no witnesses had appeared against the murderers. He persuaded the members of the Council that it was a sign of guilt for a black man in Mississippi, protecting his flocks from dogs and himself from something worse, to carry a pistol. He persuaded them to assume that the absence of witnesses was not a proof of any mob spirit in Okolona, but simply because there really were no witnesses; and he told Wallace Battle that he believed Battle’s mind to be a little unhinged by the sad event and advised him to take a vacation.\nWith such pressure put upon him, Battle backed down, shut his mouth and went off on a vacation. He spoke later at the church Convention but said nothing about the murder. At the end of the vacation he went back to the school and tried to work but he was still so upset that he could not stay. He finally and definitely resigned July 20, 1927, saying: “I have now finished twenty-five years at Okolona with the most sympathetic and lovable Board of Trustees in the world. In this I am including all former members of the Board—Messrs. Walter McDougall, Edwin R. Embree and others, including the late Dr. Joseph French Johnson, Messrs. George W. Cable, Phil McIntosh, Moses Williams and B. J. Abbott.\n“My calm and deliberate judgment, after prayers and tears, is that a quarter of a century completes my task at Okolona. I, therefore, in final decision tender my resignation to take effect at once.”\nThis for the public; but in a private letter to a friend, which we have seen, he adds: “I found that I was stifling in the South!”\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhere now is the real trouble in this astonishing case of murder and the practical suppression of all publicity concerning it for nearly two years? It lies in the fact that the Episcopal Church is at a serious disadvantage when it tries to deal with the Negro problem. It is the one great church in America which did not split on the subject of slavery. Often it boasts of this fact; and unity is a thing to boast of. Nevertheless this very fact of union spells paralysis on the Negro problem. The Episcopal Church, although the richest in the United States and the first Protestant church among Negroes, has done least for the Negro in America. It has repudiated all efforts to increase its Negro membership and it has until recently supported few Negro schools. Whenever Episcopalians try to take a high moral stand on any phase of the race problem they find themselves blocked by their Southern white constituents.\nThis does not mean that the white Episcopal South believes in lynching, mob violence and ignorance for Negroes. It does mean that these Southern white churchmen still cling to the old idea of speaking for Negroes and working for them and preventing all self-assertion on their part. They still refuse to permit any criticism of the action of the white South toward Negroes and they are determined to pretend that Southern civilization in its attitude toward black folk is the best in the United States if not in the world.\nWhen now the church faces such an episode as the Okolona murder it suffers moral paralysis. This murder in broad daylight was an affront to the Episcopal Church as well as white civilization and the acquittal of the murderers for lack of evidence in the face of that cold dead corpse was an outrageous travesty on justice. The pretense of self-defense was shameless. Despite this every pressure has been brought to bear by the officials of the Episcopal Church; first, to keep the facts of this case from being known; second, to keep them from being published; third, to keep any outside person or organizations from trying to secure justice or publicity; fourth, to compel Battle to keep silent and to induce him to go back to his work at the school.\nThe Crisis in its endeavor to tell a straight, unvarnished tale has submitted this article to the persons chiefly concerned, except Wallace Battle. They have all agreed that nothing should be published.

    "text": "The first Pan-African Congress was held February 19-21, 1919, in the Grand Hotel, Paris. The executive committee consisted of M. Blaise Diagne, President; Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois, Secretary; Mrs. Ida Gibbs Hunt and Mr. M. E. F. Fredericks. Fifty-seven delegates representing fifteen countries were present and among the speakers were members of the French Parliament, the President of Liberia, a former Secretary of State of Portugal and several other distinguished persons.\nThe second Pan-African Congress met in London August 28 and 29, 1921, in Brussels, Belgium, August 31, and September 1 and 2, 1921, and in Paris, France, September 4 and 5, 1921, with M. Blaise Diagne as President and W. E. B. Du Bois as Executive Secretary. A special committee visited the Assembly of the League of Nations with a petition, September 6. There were present one hundred and ten delegates representing thirty-three different countries and the sessions were attended by about a thousand visitors. Among the speakers were Florence Kelley of America, Norman Leys of England, Senator LaFontaine and Professor Otlet of Belgium, Blaise Diagne and M. Barthèlemy of the French Chamber of Deputies, General Sorelas of Spain, M. Paul Panda of the Belgian Congo and others. The European press of England, Scotland, France, Belgium, Germany and Italy took wide notice of the Congress.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe third Pan-African Congress was held November 7 and 8, 1923, in London and November 25, 1923 in Lisbon. There was a small number of delegates to these sessions as the Congress had not been properly worked up by the French secretary. The Circle of Peace and Foreign Relations under Mrs. A. W. Hunton as Chairman finally sent Dr. Du Bois to hold the Congress. There were some distinguished people as speakers including Sir Sidney, now Lord Olivier, Mr. H. G. Wells and Mr. Harold Lasky; and Mr. Ramsey McDonald would have been present had it not been for the sudden crisis of the general election. In Lisbon there were present the Minister of Colonies and one former minister and several members of parliament.\nIt was planned to have the fourth Pan-African Congress meet in the West Indies in 1925 but the plans miscarried on account of the difficulty of transport. Finally, the Circle of Peace and Foreign Relations, under the Chairmanship of Mrs. A. W. Hunton, came forward and undertook to assemble the Fourth Congress in New York City, August 21, 22, 23 and 24, 1927. The Circle raised nearly Three Thousand Dollars to finance the Congress and made all the arrangements. Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois acted as General Chairman and Mr. Rayford W. Logan as Secretary and interpreter. An exhibition of fifty-two maps and charts illustrating the condition of peoples of African descent was arranged by Dr. Du Bois and was on exhibition at headquarters.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe program included an opening meeting with history of the Pan-African Congresses and greetings by delegates from West Africa, several of the West Indian Islands, including Haiti, and the East Indies. To this Mr. William Pickens added a report of the Brussels Conference for Oppressed Races. On the following three days, sessions were held morning, afternoon and night, taking up African missions, the history of Africa, the history and present conditions of the West Indies, the economic development of Africa and the political partition of Africa. The closing meeting dealt with education in Africa and African art and literature.\nAmong the chief speakers during the sessions were M. Dantes Bellegarde, former Minister of Haiti to France, former Member of the Assembly of the League of Nations and Commander of the French Legion of Honor; Dr. Charles H. Wesley, of Howard University; Professor Melville Herskovits of Columbia; Professor L. W. Hansberry of Howard; Chief Amoah III of the British Gold Coast; Mr. Leslie Pinkney Hill and Mr. H. H. Phillips of Cheyney; Dr. Wilhelm Mensching of Germany; and Mr. John Vandercook. All the sessions were well attended and the evening sessions often crowded. The total attendance aggregated five thousand persons. There were 208 paid delegates, representing 22 states and the District of Columbia; Haiti, the Virgin Islands, the Bahamas and Barbadoes; South America; the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Liberia, West Africa; Germany and India. The following resolutions were adopted:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Fourth Pan-African Congress, assembled in New York City, August 21, 22, 23 and 24, 1927, with representatives from twenty-three American states, from nearly all of the West Indian Islands, from South America, Liberia, and British West Africa adopts this statement to express the legitimate aims and needs of the peoples of Negro descent.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn General\nNegroes everywhere need: 1. A voice in their own government. 2. Native rights to the land and its natural resources. 3. Modern education for all children. 4. The development of Africa for the Africans and not merely for the profit of Europeans. 5. The re-organization of commerce and industry so as to make the main object of capital and labor the welfare of the many rather than the enriching of the few. 6. The treatment of civilized men as civilized despite differences of birth, race or color.\nSpecifically and in particular we stress the need of reform in the following countries:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHaiti\nIn accordance with the report of the Committee of Six disinterested Americans we demand: the withdrawal from Haiti of all military forces of the United States and all officers, military, naval or otherwise, except only regularly accredited diplomatic representatives or consular agents. We demand that actual self-government be restored. In 1928 Haitian elections should be held. We demand that the American Receiver General of Customs be replaced by equitable agreement with the bond holders and that in general the attempt of American capital to dominate the industry and monopolize the land of Haiti be decisively checked and turned into such channels as will encourage industry and agriculture for the benefit of Haitian people.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAfrica\nThe attitude of all the imperial powers who own Africa is fundamentally wrong. They are seeking profit, not men; they want trade and industry more than civilization and spiritual uplift. This attitude is a menace, not simply to Africans, but to modern democratic culture. It must and will be changed.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBritish Africa\nWe congratulate Great Britain on granting increased political power to the four colonies of British West Africa. We urge an extension of this policy so that Africans may control their own legislative councils.\nWe urge the restoration of their land and the granting of a voice in the government to the natives of Kenya and of Northern and Southern Rhodesia.\nWe are alarmed at the attempt of the white minority in the Union of South Africa to monopolize the land of the black Aboriginees; to exclude them from profitable labor; to maintain, in effect, their present disfranchisement and to reduce them to impotent serfdom. We regard the reactionary program of the Herzog government as the greatest challenge to decent race relations in our day.\nIn all British Africa it is lamentable to note how little is being done to educate the natives despite the founding of Achimota College.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFrench Africa\nWe urge in French Africa a further development of their admirable scheme of native education and an extension of political rights for a larger number of natives. We ask protection for the natives against the exploitation by French industry and commerce of the resources of this great colony.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Belgian Congo\nWe still await in the Belgium Congo real evidence of a movement on the part of Belgium to restore land ownership to the natives; to give them some voice in their own government and to restrain the effort to make the Belgium Congo merely a profitable investment for European industry, with almost no concerted effort to uplift and develop the natives and conserve the natural resources for them. We are glad to see an increase in the appropriation for education in the Congo, but it is still far below the amount needed.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAbyssinia\nWe demand the continued independence of Abyssinia, coupled with international movements on the part of philanthropists to bring modern education to the people of that land and modern industry planned for the benefit of the Abyssinians and not simply for the European trade.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLiberia\nWe congratulate Liberia upon her improved financial position, but we are alarmed at the increasing power and influence of the owners of the Firestone rubber concession. We urge the authorities of Liberia and the Negro voters in the United States to be vigilant lest this industry’s concession encroach upon the political independence of Liberia. We believe that the solution of Liberia’s problems lies in the establishment of a strong system of universal education for all Liberians of both native and American descent.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPortugal\nWe demand for Portugal and her African colonies a curbing of that financial and industrial power which is forcing her into bankruptcy and making her colonies the property of slave-driving concessionaires, despite the liberal and far-sighted colonial legislation of Portugal.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMissions\nWe believe in missionary effort but in missionary effort for health, morals and education and not for military aggression and sectarian superstitions.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe West Indies\nWe urge the peoples of the West Indies to begin an earnest movement for the federation of these islands; the reduction of their present outrageous expenses of government; the broadening of educational facilities on modern lines and labor legislation to protect the workers against industrial exploitation. We regard the first step towards this to be an utter erasing of that color line between mulattoes and blacks, which sprang from slavery and is still being drawn and encouraged by those who are the enemies of Negro freedom.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUnited States\nWe believe that the Negroes of the United States should begin the effective use of their political power and instead of working for a few minor offices or for merely local favors and concessions, they should vote with their eyes fixed upon the international problems of the color line and the national problems which effect the Negro race in the United States. Only independent votes for candidates who will carry out their desires regardless of party will bring them political and economic freedom.\nThe economic situation of American Negroes is still precarious. We believe that along with their entry into industry as skilled and semi-skilled workers and their growing ownership of land and homes they should especially organize as consumers and from co-operative effort seek to bring to bear upon investors and producers the coercive power which co-operative consumption has already attained in certain parts of Europe and of America. Lynching, segregation and mob violence still oppress and crush black America but education and organized social and political power begin to point the way out.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOther Peoples\nUpon matters that lie outside our own problems, we must also express our thought and wish because the narrow confines of the modern world entwine our interests with those of other peoples. We desire to see freedom and real national independence in Egypt, in China and in India. We demand the cessation of the interference of the United States in the affairs of Central and South America.\nWe thank the Soviet Government of Russia for its liberal attitude toward the colored races and for the help which it has extended to them from time to time.\nWe urge the white workers of the world to realize that no program of labor uplift can be successfully carried through in Europe or America so long as colored labor is exploited and enslaved and deprived of all political power.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA committee to call a Fifth Pan-African Congress and to present to it a plan of permanent organization was appointed. It consisted of Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois, chairman, Mrs. A. W. Hunton, M. Dantes Bellegarde, Mr. H. H. Phillips, Mr. Rayford W. Logan, Mr. F. Eugene Corbie, Mr. Otto E. Huiswoud, Mrs. B. Cannady and Bishop R. C. Ransom. This committee has power to enlarge its number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMemorandum to M.

    "text": "We have received from Mrs. Helen D. Pecu of Vashon Islands, Washington, the following letter:\n\nIt have hesitated many months in writing you but each time I read your editorials the impulse comes to protest, not because I am white, but for the sake of those whose skin pigment only has set them apart in an unjust world—a world of unreasoning prejudice—that men like you have built up—for you are as violently prejudiced against all whites as the most intolerant white man is against you. It is deplorable that so excellent a magazine as The Crisis should have at its head a man who sneers at all forms of government—save the Soviet government in Russia—who can but intimidate the budding courage and genius of his people by his own big stick of Prejudice. In strong contrast, how fine is the character of Allison Davis, whose article ‘On Misgivings’ appears in the August Crisis. What influence could he not wield between the two races! What respect would his cause not command. When we who regard the colored race with the same respect we feel for our own are assailed and derided because we are white, we begin to wonder if there might not have been in some age past a basic reason for this separation of the races, that reason now continuing in the form of prejudice on both sides between minds incapable of growth.\nI do not refer to the publication of crimes or acts of injustice. They are facts that both races should gravely consider, but as any friend, white or colored, who has the interest of your race at heart, I ask you to withhold your private political and prejudiced rancor. It is improper material in your magazine and detracts from its constructive purpose.\n\nThere is no doubt but that colored people are prejudiced against white people, and that the Editor of The Crisis is one of the greatest of sinners in this respect. From long experience he has gotten into the habit of expecting certain actions, certain thoughts, certain treatment from the majority of white people. He is sometimes pleasantly disappointed. In most cases he is not. In most cases he gets just what he has been looking for, and it is quite possible that, in some of these instances, he gets it because he has been expecting it!\nBut in any case, the worse fruit of prejudice is retaliatory prejudice; because white Americans have reasons based on slavery, poverty and ignorance in the past and on thoughtlessness and lack of information in our own day, they have gotten into the habit of treating black folk in certain ways. Black folk have gradually adopted the reciprocal habit of hating white skins, of being suspicious of every white action, and particularly of talking and acting as though even those white people who are not prejudiced, or who earnestly desire not to be, belonged to the unfortunate majority.\nWhat Mrs. Pecu and others must learn is that this is the natural fruit of race prejudice. Just as no ordinary white man born and bred in the South can be expected to treat Negroes decently, in the same way, no Negro born in America can be expected to be sweet-tempered, charitable and broadminded toward white people.\nThe Editor of a magazine like The Crisis should nevertheless try to achieve such an attitude. He does try. If he fails, do not lay the fault entirely at his door. Lay it to the last lynching, or to the last time he was insulted in the theater, or to the last time he went hungry because all available hotels and restaurants were closed against him. It is all a mess, he admits and that is precisely what The Crisis has been trying to say for many years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Crisis (1910)\nA Statement (1919)\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nThe Black Man and the Unions (1918)\nAllies (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Prejudice.” The Crisis 34\n(9): 311. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/34/09/prejudice.html."

They are going to be beaten again and again, but they are going to win some day, if they eternally stick to it; if they twist and turn, attack now here and now there, return to the attack when beaten and insist that public almsgiving for the support of skilled labor is nothing less than stealing, foisted by the Pullman Car Company on a public which is too inert and short-sighted to stop it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Black Man and Labor (1925)\nPullman Porters (1926)\nRailroad Unions (1921)\nDoes Organization Pay?

    "text": "It is astonishing to see the determination with which those who believe in the industrial methods of America and Western Europe are spreading misinformation concerning the Russian experiment. The central thing which has happened in Russia is this: the rotten, horrible, inexpressibly brutal and silly tyranny of the Czar, has been definitely and finally overthrown. No such travesty on decent government has existed elsewhere in Europe in modern days. It was a stench in the nostrils of humanity. It was flamboyant and impudent with murder and cruelty, on a foundation of ignorance and poverty and with flaming towers of ostentation and show which completely captivated the organized snobbery of the world. To be presented at the Russian Imperial Court was the last round in the ladder of ambition for every social climber in Europe and America.\nThe rottenness of the Czar’s Government was repeatedly exposed to the liberal world. Not a finger was raised to help. On the contrary, when in desperation Russia rose in 1905 to shake off medieval despotism and establish modern democracy, Western Europe poured its treasure into the hands of the Czar to beat the wretched Revolutionists back. Now finally, when of their own strength and determination, and their own vast will to sacrifice, the Russian people have buried Czarism and tried to establish a new government that frankly faces the economic problem which the world fears to face, there is scarcely a newspaper in America that will give this experiment even decent hearing. Yet the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics is celebrating today its Tenth Anniversary, and here’s hoping that this is but the first decade toward its hundred years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro and Communism (1931)\nRussia, 1926 (1926)\nJudging Russia (1927)\nThe Negro and Radical Thought (1921)\nPrejudice (1927)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Ten Years.” The Crisis 34\n(10): 348. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/34/10/ten_years.html."

    "text": "Let us take courage from certain present aspects of the Negro problem. Friction there has always been between black and white since 1619. Friction there will probably be still in 2019. But the friction rises in the scale; it touches, decade by decade, higher levels—higher interests, higher sensibilities, even while the lower friction persists. To illustrate our meaning consider this table.\n1860—Physical freedom\n1870—Crime and poverty\n1880—Right to hold property\n1890—Reading and writing\n1900—Voting\n1910—Lynching\n1920—Homes\nThere was freedom for some Negroes before 1860 but that year it became a problem for all. The crime and degradation incident to emancipation was critical in 1870. By 1880 we had to answer the query if Negroes could own property. By 1890 the Negroes’ right to some education was won. By 1900 the Negro had been disfranchised in fact but in law he was a legal voter. Before 1900, lynching was defensible and met with little opposition and until this decade there was almost no wide-spread problem of Negroes living in desirable homes next to whites because black folk were too poor to buy such homes. Thus even in the record of discrimination we are pressing on and up. The founding stones still waver, far from fast, but the trembling walls reach up to higher friction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nViolations of Property Rights (1911)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nWork for Black Folk in 1914 (1914)\nThe Negro and the Land (1914)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “The Higher Friction.”\nThe Crisis 34 (2): 70. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/34/02/higher_friction.html."

    "text": "The late Chicago election was a serious misfortune. The Democratic mayor had previously made overtures to colored people. He had even spoken at the annual N.A.A.C.P. Conference. Thompson, the Republican, is a well-known demagogue, who represents open house to gamblers, bootleggers and prostitutes. Wise white Americans would have advised colored people in a campaign of this sort to vote for the Democrats. If they had been permitted, many far-sighted Negroes would have taken this advice. Indeed the most astute Negro politician in Chicago fought Thompson to the last in the Republican Primary and lost his city patronage when Thompson won.\nThe silly Democrats of Chicago did not think that the intelligent Negro vote would be as valuable to them as the votes of the Negro haters and the Ku Klux Klan. They therefore flooded the city with anti-Negro propaganda; they sang “Bye-Bye, Blackbirds” everywhere. They sent out placards saying: “Don’t vote yourselves Nigger wages”; they distributed cartoons of a train loaded with Negroes and the legend: “Big Bill’s express will start for Chicago April 6th unless you stop it April 5th”; and then they asked white voters if they wanted Negro teachers to teach their children; if they wanted Negroes to work in the stock yards and the factories; if they could stand a colored judge, two colored aldermen, a colored Senator and 6 colored representatives. They pointed to 300 colored policemen and 200 colored firemen and other colored civilian employees. They issued dodgers showing Mayor Thompson kissing a black baby and bearing the statement: “Thompson, Africa first.”\nWhat was the result of this campaign? It resulted in bringing in race and national propaganda of other sorts: attacks upon England; appeals to the bitter memories of Germans and the like. But above all, it forced every Negro voter, no matter what his attitude toward Thompson was, to vote for Thompson and against Dever. He did not even dare throw his vote away on a third candidate. He was compelled to deliver himself bound hand and foot to one of the worse representatives of the Republican machine.\nAll of which brings us to remark: that for bull-headed asininity, commend us to the Democratic party; only in New York City and in Tammany Hall does it appear to have glimmerings of common sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro Politician (1928)\nThe Election (1928)\nThe Election (1924)\nThe Negro in Politics (1929)\nThe Republican Party (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Chicago.” The Crisis 34\n(4): 131. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/34/04/chicago.html."

The discrimination in cafeterias, except in two cases, has been absolutely repudiated by the heads of departments over their own signature.\n\nThere remains, therefore, three things to be done:\n\nClerks who are discriminated against in the future must be ready and willing to test the legality of the discrimination.\nLegal action must be taken against two cafeterias, one of which is in the Congressional Library, where deliberate and illegal discrimination is well-known.\nEffort must be made to see how far clerks of Negro descent are being kept from appointment and from promotion simply because of color.\n\nThe N.A.A.C.P. will now address itself to these last two matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Race Segregation (1934)\nEducation (1913)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nMr. Taft (1911)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Segregation.” The Crisis 35\n(12): 418. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/12/segregation.html."

    "text": "The problem of marriage among our present American Negroes, is a difficult one. On the one hand go conflicting philosophies: should we black folk breed children or commit biological suicide? On the other, should we seek larger sex freedom or closer conventional rules? Should we guide and mate our children like the French or leave the whole matter of sex intermingling to the chance of the street, like Americans? These are puzzling questions and all the more so because we do not often honestly face them.\nI was a little startled when came father of a girl. I scented far-off difficulties. But she became soon a round little bunch of Joy: plump and jolly, full of smiles and fun—a flash of twinkling legs and bubbling mischief. Always there on the broad campus of Atlanta University she was in scrapes and escapades—how many I never dreamed until years, after: running away from her sleepy nurse; riding old Billy, the sage and dignified draft horse; climbing walls; bullying the Matron; cajoling the cooks and becoming the thoroughly spoiled and immeasurably loved Baby of the Campus. How far the spoiling had gone I became suddenly aware one summer, when we stopped a while to breathe the salt sea air at Atlantic City. This tot of four years marched beside me down the Boardwalk amid the unmoved and almost unnoticing crowd. She was puzzled. Never before in her memory had the world treated her quite so indifferently.\n“Papa,” she exclaimed at last, impatiently, “I guess they don’t know I’m here!”\n \nAs the Girl grew so grew her problems: School; Multiplication Tables; Playmates; Latin; Clothes—Boys! No sooner had we faced one than the other loomed, the last lingered—the next threatened. She went to Kindergarten with her playmates of the Campus—kids and half-grown-ups. The half-grown-ups, Normal students, did me the special courtesy of letting the Girl dawdle and play and cut up. So when she came at the age of ten to the Ethical Culture School in New York there loomed the unlearned Multiplication Table; and a time we had! For despite all proposals of “letting the Child develop as it Will!,” she must learn to read and count; and the school! taught her—but at a price! Then came the days of gawky growth; the impossible children of the street; someone to play with; wild tears at going to bed; excursions, games—and far, far in the offing, the shadow of the Fear of the Color Line.\nI had a Grand Idea. Before the time loomed—before the Hurt pierced and lingered and festered, off to England she should go for high school and come back armed with manners and knowledge, cap-a-pie, to fight American race hate and insult. Off the Girl went to Bedale’s, just as war thundered in the world. As a professor of Economics and History, I knew the war would be short—a few months. So away went Mother and Girl. Two mighty years rolled turbulently by and back came both through the Submarine Zone. The Girl had grown. She was a reticent stranger with whom soul-revealing converse was difficult. I found myself groping for continual introductions.\n \nThen came Latin. The English teacher talked Latin and his class at Bedale’s romped with Caesar through a living Gallia. The American teacher in the Brooklyn Girl’s High did not even talk English and regarded Latin as a crossword puzzle with three inches of daily solution. “Decline Stella!”; “Conjugate Amo”; “What is the subject of ‘Gallia est omnis divisa——’.” “Nonsense,” said the Girl (which was quite true) “I’ve dropped Latin.”\n“But the colleges haven’t, I moaned.”Why college?” countered the Girl.\nWhy indeed? I tried Cicero “pro Archia Poeta.” The Girl was cold. Then I pleaded for my own spiritual integrity: “I have told 12 millions to go to college—what will they say if you don’t go?” The Girl admitted that that was reasonable but she said she was considering marriage and really thought she knew about all that schools could teach effectively. I, too, was reasonable and most considerate, despite the fact that I was internally aghast. This baby—married—My God!—but, of course, I said aloud: Honorable state and all that; and “Go ahead, if you like—but how about a year in college as a sort of, well, introduction to life in general and for furnishing topics of conversation in the long years to come? How about it?” “Fair enough,” said the Girl and she went to college.\n \nBoys! queer animals. Hereditary enemies of Fathers-with-daughters and Mothers! Mother had chaperoned the Girl relentlessly through High School. Most Mothers didn’t bother. It was a bore and one felt like the uninvited guest or the veritable Death’s Head. The Girl didn’t mind much, only—“Well, really Mother you don’t need to go or even to sit up.” But Mother stuck to her job. I’ve always had the feeling that the real trick was turned in those years, by a very soft-voiced and persistent Mother who was always hanging about unobtrusively. The boys liked her, the girls were good-naturedly condescending; the Girl laughed. It was so funny. Father, of course, was busy with larger matters and weightier problems, including himself.\nClothes. In the midst of high school came sudden clothes. The problem of raiment. The astonishing transformation of the hoyden and hiker and basketball expert into an amazing butterfly. We parents had expressed lofty distain for the new colored beauty parlors—straightening and bleaching, the very idea! But they didn’t straighten, they cleaned and curled; they didn’t whiten, they delicately darkened. They did for colored girls’ style of beauty what two sophisticated centuries had been doing for blonde frights. When the finished product stood forth all silked and embroidered, briefly skirted and long-limbed with impudent lip-stick and jaunty toque—well, Thrift hung its diminished head and Philosophy stammered. What shall we do about our daughter’s extravagant dress? The beauty of colored girls has increased 100% in a decade because they give to it time and trouble. Can we stop it? Should we? Where shall we draw the line, with good silk stockings at $1.95 per pair?\n“Girl! You take so long to dress! I can dress in fifteen minutes.”\n“Yes—Mamma and you look it!” came the frankly unfilial answer.\n \nCollege. College was absence and premonition. Empty absence and occasional letters and abrupt pauses. One wondered uneasily what they were doing with the Girl; who rather than what was educating her. Four years of vague uneasiness with flashes of hectic and puzzling vacations. Once with startling abruptness there arose the Shadow of Death—acute appendicitis; the hospital—the cold, sharp knife; the horror of waiting and the namelessly sweet thrill of recovery. Of course, all the spoiling began again and it literally rained silk and gold.\nAbsence, too, resulted in the unexpected increase in Parent-valuation. Mother was enshrined and worshipped by the absent Girl; no longer was she merely convenient and at times in the way. She was desperately adored. Even Father took on unaccustomed importance and dignity and found new place in the scheme of things. We both felt quite set up.\nThen graduation and a Woman appeared in the family. A sudden woman—sedate, self-contained, casual, grown; with a personality—with wants, expenses, plans. “There will be a caller tonight.”—“Tomorrow night I’m going out.”\nIt was a bit disconcerting, this transforming of a rubber ball of childish joy into a lady whose address was at your own house. I acquired the habit of discussing the world with this stranger—as impersonally and coolly as possible: teaching—travel—reading—art—marriage. I achieved quite a detached air, letting the domineering daddy burst through only at intervals, when it seemed impossible not to remark—“It’s midnight, my dear,” and “when is the gentleman going? You need sleep!”\n \nMy part in Mate-selection was admittedly small but I flatter myself not altogether negligible. We talked the young men over—their fathers and grandfathers; their education; their ability to earn particular sorts of living; their dispositions. All this incidentally mind you—not didactically or systematically. Once or twice I went on long letter hunts for facts; usually facts were all too clear and only deductions necessary. What was the result? I really don’t know. Sometimes I half suspect that the Girl arranged it all and that I was the large and solemn fly on the wheel. At other times I flatter myself that I was astute, secret, wise and powerful. Truth doubtless lurks between. So the Girl marries.\nI remember the Boy came to me somewhat breathlessly one Christmas eve with a ring in his pocket. I told him as I had told others. “Ask her—she’ll settle the matter; not I.” But he was a nice boy. A rather unusual b0y with the promise of fine manhood. I wished him luck. But I did not dare plead his cause. I had learned—well, I had learned.\nThus the world grew and blossomed and changed and so the Girl marries. It is the end of an era—a sudden break and beginning. I rub my eyes and readjust my soul. I plan frantically. It will be a simple, quiet ceremony——\n“In a church, father!”\n“Oh! in a church? Of course, in a church. Well, a church wedding would be a little larger, but——”\n“With Countée’s father and the Reverend Frazier Miller assisting.”\n“To be sure—well, that is possible and, indeed, probable.”\n“And there will be sixteen bridesmaids.”\nOne has to be firm somewhere—“But my dear! who ever heard of sixteen bridesmaids!’\n“But Papa, there are eleven Moles and five indispensables and Margaret——”\n \nWhy argue? What has to be, must be; and this evidently had to be I struggled faintly but succumbed Now with sixteen bridesmaids and ten ushers must go at least as many invited guests.\nYou who in travail of soul have struggled with the devastating puzzle of selecting a small bridge party out of your total of twenty-five intimate friends, lend me your sympathy! For we faced the world-shattering problem of selecting for two only children, the friends of a pastor with twenty-five years service in one church; and the friends of a man who knows good people in forty-five states and three continents. I may recover from it but I shall never look quite the same. I shall always have a furtive feeling in my soul. I know that at the next corner I shall meet my Best Friend and remember that I forgot to invite him. Never in all eternity can I explain. How can I say: “Bill, I just forgot you!” Or “My dear Mrs. Blubenski, I didn’t remember where on earth you were or indeed if you were at all or ever!” No, one can’t say such things. I shall only stare at them pleadingly, in doubt and pain, and slink wordlessly away.\nThirteen hundred were bidden to the marriage and no human being has one thousand three hundred friends! Five hundred came down to greet the bride at a jolly reception which I had originally planned for twenty-five. Of course, I was glad they were there. I expanded and wished for a thousand. Three thousand saw the marriage and a thousand waited on the streets. It was a great pageant; a heart-swelling throng; birds sang and Melville Charlton let the organ roll and swell beneath his quivering hands. A sweet young voice sang of Love; and then came the holy:\n“Freudig gefuert, Ziehet dahin!”\n \nThe symbolism of that procession was tremendous. It was not the mere marriage of a maiden. It was not simply the wedding of a fine young poet. It was the symbolic march of young and black America. America, because there was Harvard, Columbia, Smith, Brown, Howard, Chicago, Syracuse, Penn and Cornell. There were three Masters of Arts and fourteen Bachelors. There were poets and teachers, actors, artists and students. But it was not simply conventional America—it had a dark and shimmering beauty all its own; a calm and high restraint and sense of new power; it was a new race; a new thought; a new thing rejoicing in a ceremony as old as the world. (And after it all and before it, such a jolly, happy crowd; some of the girls even smoked cigarettes!)\nWhy should there have been so much of pomp and ceremony—flowers and carriages and silk hats; wedding cake and wedding music? After all marriage in its essence is and should be very simple: a clasp of friendly hands; a walking away together of Two who say “Let us try to be One and face and fight a lonely world together!” What more? Is that not enough? Quite; and were I merely white I should have sought to make it end with this.\n \nBut it seems to me that I owe something extra to an Idea, a Tradition. We who are black and panting up hurried hills of hate and hindrance—we have got to establish new footholds on the slipping by-paths through which we come. They must at once be footholds of the free and the eternal, the new and the enthralled. With all of our just flouting of white convention and black religion, some things remain eternally so—Birth, Death, Pain, Mating, Children, Age. Ever and anon we must point to these truths and if the pointing be beautiful with music and ceremony or bare with silence and darkness—what matter? The width or narrowness of the gesture is a matter of choice. That one will have it stripped to the essence. It is still good and true. This soul wants color with bursting cords and scores of smiling eyes in happy raiment. It must be as this soul wills. The Girl wills this. So the Girl marries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCorrespondence (1926)\nIntermarriage (1927)\nInter-Marriage (1924)\nIt is a Girl (1933)\nIntermarriage (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “So the Girl Marries.”\nThe Crisis 35 (6): 192–93, 207–9. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/06/so_the_girl_marries.html."

    "text": "There is probably no modern play-ground whose social foundation is more utterly false and criminal than Florida. Before the boom, Florida was a lovely, sleepy semi-tropical land with a working class predominantly Negro and with unusually cordial relations between the races, albeit based on the old slave paternalism. Then came fruit culture, land exploitation, fashion propaganda, easy liquor and open gambling. The demand for labor and service brought a mass of immigrants from the neighboring poor whites of Georgia and Alabama and even further away. A bitter rivalry arose between the white and black workers and the black workers, deprived of political power, went further and further to the wall. The white workers were debauched by the chances of high wage, graft and illegitimate methods of making money of all sorts.\nThe results of all this could be illustrated in a hundred ways, but let us take one recent case:\nJuly 15, 1925. In Miami, Police Sergeant Tibbits is shot. The police have no clue.\nJuly 16, 1925. A Negro, H. Kier, was found shot to death in the Northwest part of the city near the ball park.\nJuly 17, 1925. Tibbits will recover. Chief of Police, H. L. Quigg, offers a reward of $500 for the arrest and conviction of his unknown assailant.\nMarch, 1928. Tibbits, now Lieutenant, together with a city detective, are arrested. The Grand Jury investigating alleged police brutalities, returned indictments against Tibbits and others, charging them with the murder of Kier. A police detective testifying declares that Kier, a bellboy, was accused of carrying a message for a white man to a white woman asking the woman to meet the man. The woman’s mother complained to the hotel proprietor and identified Kier as the messenger. The police were called. Kier denied his guilt but was knocked to the floor by a policeman’s club. When he was able to get up, he said that he was guilty. The proprietor asked the detective “not to murder the boy in my hotel.” They took the Negro to police headquarters where the Chief of Police, H. L. Quigg, told them not to enter any charge against him. The policemen took Kier in an automobile out to the Northwestern part of the city. Then they threw him out and tried to shoot him. The first shot went wild and struck Tibbits. They continued shooting and when Kier was dead they left the body on the highway and carried Tibbits to the hospital. Chief of Police Quigg called and advised them to agree on a story. He asked the officers to go and hide the body, but they refused. They agreed, however, to say that the Negro had grabbed Tibbits’ gun and that the other officers fired in self-defense, in case the matter ever came to court.\nMarch 24, 1928. H. L. Quigg, Miami Chief of Police, is charged with first degree murder, together with Tibbits and others.\nApril 17, their trial begins.\nApril 29, Quigg and his co-defendants are acquitted.\nThere was, of course, no chance that Quigg and his colleagues would suffer any severe punishment. It is alleged that for years they have been at the head of the ring which sells the privilege to gamble and import liquor in the city of Miami, and that Quigg is a very rich man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nSouthern Papers (1911)\nSigns from the South (1919)\nSlavery (1922)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Sunny Florida.” The Crisis\n35 (6): 203–4. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/06/sunny_florida.html."

In the United States at Harvard, Columbia and such institutions underground methods are used to limit the number of Jews and Negroes admitted. But Butler College, Indianapolis, goes back to the open and honest methods of Czarist Russia. Butler is “conceived by Christian influences and dedicated to the dispensation of a religious education, fitting men for Christian living.” A few years ago it had practically no Negro students. Then as the number of Negroes increased in the high schools of Indianapolis a considerable number of them went to Butler. Last year Butler graduated twelve Negro students. This seems to have alarmed the authorities and this year they have announced that only ten colored students will be received each year. One can understand racial reactions due to crime, poverty and laziness, but the exclusion of ambitious, young students from institutions of learning, supported by public benevolence and “Christianity,” merely on account of race and color, is a contradiction of every known principle of democracy and religion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro College (1933)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nSegregation (1910)\nEducation (1911)\nThe White Church (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Exclusion.” The Crisis 35\n(1): 23. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/01/exclusion.html."

The snapshot was taken by a travelling salesman who had the film developed at Melbourne, Alabama, and then gave a copy to a colored police officer. We have been able to get no further information.

    "text": "This article was originally prepared for the Stock-Taking and Fact-Finding Conference which met in Durham, North Carolina, in December, 1927. With some additions and revisions it was delivered again before the opening meeting of the 19th Annual N.A.A.C.P. Conference at Los Angeles in June, 1928. It appears in print for the first time and will be published in two parts.\nIn the presidential campaign just beginning one question transcends all others. This question which transcends, in its importance and immediacy, the questions of farm relief, flood control, national control of superpower, liquor and the tariff, is the question as to how far the policies of this government are going to be controlled by the vote of its citizens.\nIn other words, we cannot take up the various pressing questions confronting us until we settle this matter of ultimate democratic control. Despite tradition and assumption, this question is not settled. The proportion of actual voters among the voting population of the United States is between twenty-five and thirty-three per cent out of sixty million citizens twenty-one years of age and over.\nThe loss of interest in voting or the prevention by various means and methods of allowing citizens to exercise the right to vote, is a national phenomenon. Nowhere in the United States is there a voting population of seventy per cent of those qualified as in Eastern Canada, or seventy to eighty per cent as in France, Belgium, Holland, Germany and Switzerland. We do not even reach the sixty-four per cent of Italy and South America and, of course, the eighty or ninety per cent of Australia is apparently beyond our dreams.\n \nOr to put it another way; in 1920 we had both a presidential election and a decennial census; so that for the first time in twenty years we knew the population at the time of an election. In that election, the following percentage of citizens twenty-one years of age and over did not vote in the several states:\n\n\n\n\nPer Cent\n\nPer Cent\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n92\nWyoming\n45\n\n\nMississippi\n91\nNebraska\n45\n\n\nGeorgia\n90\nMichigan\n45\n\n\nLouisiana\n88\nSouth Dakota\n44\n\n\nTexas\n82\nNew York\n44\n\n\nVirginia\n81\nColorado\n43\n\n\nArkansas\n79\nKansas\n43\n\n\nAlabama\n79\nConnecticut\n43\n\n\nFlorida\n72\nRhode Island\n42\n\n\nTennessee\n65\nNew Jersey\n41\n\n\nPennsylvania\n58\nWest Virginia\n39\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n56\nIdaho\n39\n\n\nVermont\n55\nMontana\n39\n\n\nMaine\n55\nNew Mexico\n38\n\n\nArizona\n53\nNevada\n38\n\n\nCalifornia\n52\nOhio\n38\n\n\nOklahoma\n51\nIowa\n35\n\n\nIllinois\n50\nNew Hampshire\n33\n\n\nMinnesota\n50\nMissouri\n33\n\n\nMaryland\n48\nUtah\n30\n\n\nWashington\n48\nNorth Dakota\n30\n\n\nWisconsin\n48\nKentucky\n29\n\n\nOregon\n48\nIndiana\n26\n\n\nMassachusetts\n47\nDelaware\n25\n\n\n\nThe largest percentage of voluntary and involuntary disfranchisement is in South; but it is not confined to the South. Over one-half the adults of Pennsylvania, Vermont, Maine and California stayed from the poles and nearly one-half the voting population of Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, Wisconsin, Oregon, Massachusetts, Wyoming, Nebraska and Michigan. In only one state in the United States did three-fourths of the voters go to the poles and in only eight states did two-thirds go.\nThis is a serious thing. The theory of democracy does not call for equality of gift, universal college education or absolute individual integrity; but it does depend upon the widest possible consultation with the mass of citizens on the theory that only in this way can you consult ultimate authority and ultimate sovereignty. This theory may be wrong. Possibly the United States is ready to adopt a restricted ballot and base sovereignty upon an electorate limited by education, occupation, ability, birth, wealth, race, or some combination of these factors. Possibly we are ready for Italian syndicalistic oligarchy or Spanish dictatorship. But if this is true we must face the change frankly and adopt it logically. We must not drift further as we are doing. For a generation the possibility of any rational consultation of the public will in this country has been fading.\n \nToday, the difference in the relative political power of the various states and groups of states is so enormous in the United States that no American has any right to sneer at Old Sarum or at the conditions that brought the first English Reform Bill. This can be illustrated by a table which shows the number of votes cast in the various states for the election of each of that state’s representatives in Congress:\n\n\n\n1920\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n9,449\nIdaho\n67,471\n\n\nMississippi\n10,312\nNorth Carolina\n68,592\n\n\nGeorgia\n12,394\nMaryland\n71,211\n\n\nLouisiana\n15,733\nKansas\n71,278\n\n\nTexas\n22,973\nConnecticut\n72,802\n\n\nVirginia\n23,100\nUtah\n72,914\n\n\nAlabama\n24,107\nColorado\n73,014\n\n\nArkansas\n25,801\nMinnesota\n73,504\n\n\nNevada\n27,194\nNew Jersey\n75,333\n\n\nFlorida\n30,706\nOregon\n76,174\n\n\nTennessee\n42,863\nIllinois\n77,425\n\n\nVermont\n44,985\nWashington\n78,720\n\n\nMaine\n49,283\nNew Hampshire\n70,372\n\n\nPennsylvania\n51,380\nMichigan\n81,406\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n53,570\nIowa\n70,981\n\n\nRhode Island\n55,795\nMissouri\n83,165\n\n\nWyoming\n58,190\nKentucky\n83,519\n\n\nSouth Dakota\n60,373\nWest Virginia\n84,990\n\n\nOklahoma\n60,572\nCalifornia\n85,750\n\n\nMassachusetts\n62,507\nMontana\n89,502\n\n\nWisconsin\n63,753\nOhio\n91,795\n\n\nNebraska\n63,778\nDelaware\n94,758\n\n\nArizona\n68,687\nIndiana\n97,108\n\n\nNew York\n67,328\nNew Mexico\n105,131\n\n\n\nThe stranger from Mars looking at this table would immediately ask: “Why is it that the citizens from South Carolina should have eleven times as much political power as the citizens of New Mexico?” Or: “How can a voter in Massachusetts have fifty per cent more power than the voter in Indiana?”\nIf we group the states geographically we find that in 1920 the Pacific and Northwestern States cast 1,945,504 votes for 24 representatives in Congress, or 81,067 votes per congressman. The Middle West States cast 10,088,606 votes for 127 representatives, or 79,439 votes per representative. The Border States cast 4,194,509 votes for 58 representatives, or 72,319 votes per representative. The Southwest States cast 636,893 votes tor 9 representatives, or 70,766 votes per representative. The Middle Atlantic States cast 5,649,216 votes for 91 representatives or 61,079 votes per representative. The New England States cast 967,711 votes for 32 representatives, or 61,492 votes per representative. Contrast this with the South, which cast only 2,175,007 votes and yet with them elected 94 representatives, or only 23,138 votes per representative.\nOr put it another way, a million voters elect:\n\n\nOn the Pacific Coast—12 Congressmen.\n\n\nIn the Middle West—13 Congressmen.\n\n\nIn New England—16 Congressmen.\n\n\nIn the South—45 Congressmen.\n\n\n \nNew England has an enormous advantage over the Northwest and considerable over the Middle West, while the political advantage of the South is so extraordinary as to force consideration of its peculiar situation. When one gets thus far in the argument, there arises in the mind of the average American reader the fact that the whole argument involves, at least in large part, the South; and brings back the almost forgotten question of Negro suffrage. This is true; but the object of this paper is to impress the fact that the question at issue is much larger than this and that no matter what the discussion involves, it must be discussed, or else democratic government in the United States is impossible.\nSenator Swanson of Virginia has just said in the Senate:\n\nThe South has exercised her constitutional rights to eliminate a class of ignorant, shiftless and corrupt voters.” Other states like Massachusetts have disfranchised the illiterate and, of course, the un-naturalized foreigners.\n\nThere is no doubt that any modern democratic community faced by a large amount of ignorance, unusual poverty and political corruption must in some way defend itself. In the defense which the South attempted to make against ignorance, poverty and corruption, she had the moral support of the majority of citizens of the United States. But it is over a half century since the 15th Amendment was proclaimed and a full generation since the new Southern disfranchisement was begun. At that time to disfranchise the poor and ignorant automatically excluded the great mass of the black men from the ballot. Today, a large number is still poor and illiterate. But today it is also true that large numbers of black men are disfranchised not because of ignorance or thriftlessness but simply and frankly because they are black. A critical time of consideration is approaching. Any day a case like the Texas primary may appear in the Supreme Court which will gravely challenge present methods and it is doubtful if any mere appeal to mob law against any such decision will be tolerated even in the South. Surely then the time has come for a careful, dispassionate consideration—not so much of the political condition of the South as of the effect which the political legislation of the South from 1890 to 1909 has had upon the politics of the nation.\n \nFirst and foremost, it is necessary for the nation to ask the Southern States what it is they wish today to disfranchise—race or condition? If the first is what they propose, that is illegal and can only be done by constitutional amendment. There may be reasons which appeal to Americans why disfranchisement by race is desirable. If so, such a campaign should be inaugurated.\nThere has been a demand for this from a few persons North and South. But the reason that such a campaign has not been seriously suggested, is, of course, clear: the nation would logically demand first and foremost that if Negroes as such, are legally excluded from the right of suffrage, they should not be counted as a basis of representation either in Congress or the state legislatures. In the founding of the American republic, New England demanded that representation in Congress be based on the free population. Its stand was logically impregnable, and the only real, albeit unspoken argument that led to compromise, was the feeling that eventually the slave population was going to disappear, either by emancipation into freedom or by deportation. Until this time, slaves were to count two-fifths of the white population in determining representation.\nWith the 13th Amendment, Negroes, although still economically enslaved, counted as five-fifths. With the new disfranchising laws, they still count just as fully as the white population. But this again was permitted on the tacit assumption that these laws were temporary in their application—that when the freedmen learned to read and write, accumulated property and established a modern, cultural life, they would be allowed to vote on the same terms as other Americans. Not only was this a former assumption of the North—it was the plain statement and repeated promise of the South.\n \nIt is, then, but reasonable that if the South wishes now to change the constitution and laws of the United States and make it possible to exclude men from voting on account of race and color—that the test of its sincerity is its willingness in that case not to count the colored population as a basis for representation.\nIf on the other hand the South merely wishes to get rid of an electorate too ignorant, too poverty stricken and corrupt to vote honestly, it has already a multiplicity of laws on the subject. But laws of this sort ought so to be drawn and administered as to encourage education and thrift and honesty and their proper test is the gradual disappearance of illiteracy and the gradual enfranchisement of Negroes, otherwise, they are ineffective and dangerous.\nAs a matter of fact, just whom does the South disfranchise? It is difficult to get an official record of voting in the United States and especially difficult in the South with regard to the voting of Negroes.\nIn Louisiana the state furnishes a fairly accurate official record. In the election for President in 1924, there were 274,592 white persons registered and 980 Negroes. The white population of the state in 1920 was 1,096,611; the Negro population was 700,257. Of these, 564,933 whites were 21 years of age and over, and 359,251 Negroes. Of the adult Negroes 229,980 were reported as illiterate. The leaves 129,271 who can read and write. The statistics of illiteracy are inaccurate. Still, it would seem reasonable to suppose that at least 100,000 Louisiana Negroes were men of average intelligence, able to read and write. Nearly eighty percent of the Negro population, 10 years of age and over, is engaged in gainful occupations, and includes 164,109 farmers, 52,687 in manufacturing and mechanical industries, 21,802 working in transportation, 6,700 engaged in trade, 1,983 in the public service, 3,385 in professional service, 1,308 clerks and 54,370 servants. Moreover, among the Negroes there were more than 10,000 persons who owned their farms, and in addition to these farmers, 28,906 Negroes owned their homes. The total property owned by Negroes of Louisiana is not not actually known but judging from Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina, where records are kept, it cannot be less than $75,000,000.\n \nYet out of all these people, only 980 were allowed to register and vote and the number of Negro registered voters has decreased almost by half in the last 16 years, as there were 1,743 registered in 1908. Manifestly Louisiana is disfranchising mainly by race and not simply for illiteracy or shiftlessness.\nIn Alabama, there were reported 269,847 Negroes 21 years of age and over who could read and write in 1920. Careful inquiry shows that “there are not more than 3,500 Negroes voting in the state of Alabama and less than 1,000 in the city of Birmingham.”\nIn Macon County, for instance, where Tuskegee Institute is situated, there are 4,927 Negroes 21 years of age and over who can read and write, and of these 22 are registered voters.\nIn Montgomery County, containing the capital of the state, out of 13,973 literate Negroes, 21 years of age and over, 41 are registered.\nIn Mobile County, out of 17,375 literate Negroes 21 years of age and over, 958 are registered.\nIn the city of Birmingham, among the most progressive of the industrialized Negro group, out of 33,655 Negroes 21 years of age and over, who can read and write, less than 1,000 are registered voters. .\n \nIn Mississippi, according to a careful inquiry made in 1927, there are at present 850 Negroes registered, out of a total literate Negro population 21 years of age and over, of (1920) 290,782. A resident of the state writes :\n\nThe requirements for registration in this state are that the applicants must be able to ‘read and write’, or understand the Constitution when read to them and must have paid their poll] tax for the past two years prior to the time at which they offer for registration.\n\nThe Clerk of the Circuit Court in each county, or his deputy, is the sole judge of every one’s ability to qualify for registration and he is invariably a Democrat and adamant. All white folk are ‘qualified’. If a white person cannot read or write, such person is always able to ‘understand the constitution when read’. Hence, all white folk vote.\n\nWhen a colored man comes up to register, as a rule, he is either unceremoniously ordered out of the office with an oath before a question even has been asked; or is told by the clerk that he is busy and hasn’t time to register him; or is given something to read or asked a question, only to have the registration book closed, slammed to, and be told that he cannot qualify.\n\nThe Negro vote is smaller now than a year ago, since the last legislature called for a new registration and it appears that it is a most difficult matter, to get as many on the rolls as were registered before. For example, in Hinds, the largest county in the State, there were 98 Negroes registered a year ago, but only 60 now.\n\nIn the state of Georgia, out of 369,511 Negroes 21 years of age and over, who can read and write, no one knows or is able to find out, apparently how many Negroes are registered. During the year 1926, 90,000 Negroes paid poll taxes and should have been entitled to vote. It is doubtful, however, if as many as 10,000 actually voted.\nFrom Chatham County, where 22,678 Negroes 21 years of age and over can read and write, there were 2,200 registered Negro voters in 1922 and 900 in 1927.\nIn Floyd County, where there are 2,488 Negroes 21 years of age and over who can read and write, there are 120 colored women and 154 colored men who are registered.\n \nIn Texas the difficulties are illustrated by one incident brought to my attention in 1918. Marion County, Texas, has a population of 10,886, of which 6,667 are Negroes. There are 2,146 whites 21 years of age and over, and 2,937 Negroes. Forty-three of the whites are illiterate and 855 of the Negroes. It would look as though at least 1,500 of the Negroes were persons of intelligence and thrift, because they owned, in 1918, 85 per cent of the cultivated land and paid, outside the corporation taxes, over 50 per cent. of the taxes. Many Negroes owned farms of 1,000 acres and more,—one owning 3,200 acres. The Negroes owned 23 cotton gins, 25 grist mills, 32 saw mills and 17 shingle mills. There were 25 small merchants and one colored physician whose practice was 50 per cent. white. The six months colored county schools was “fairly good.” The town school in Jefferson ran nine months and had ten grades. And yet, in the face of that, the following election notice was issued Tuesday, September 3rd, 1918:\n\nTo the People of Jefferson:\n\nThe election to be held Tuesday, Sept. 3rd is for the purpose of voting to repeal the stock law or allowing it to stand as it is.\n\nIt was unanimously voted by the Council to allow all White Citizens, Men and Women in the City of Jefferson, 21 years of age to vote on this question as the Council wants to know how the people stand on it. The people who are in favor of Repealing this law are willing that an Ordinance be passed allowing stock to run at large from 6 A. M. from 1st day of April until 1st day of December which would be 8 months in the year and put them up the remaining 4 months. You are all interested.\n\nSo come out and vote.\n\nThe Committee.\nIt must be remembered that a Stock Law, which regulates the fencing of crops and the running at large of stock, is of great importance, both to the farmer and the small town worker.

Slemp, Howard, Tolbert, Ben Davis and most of the Southern politicians, black and white, of both parties, have trafficked in public offices. White Democrats have bought offices and white Republicans, like Herbert Hoover, have received the votes thus paid for in the National Republican Conventions. The whole situation is a crying shame to American politics and remains so because the mass of black voters in the South is disfranchised and their political power wielded by grafting politicians of all colors and conditions. When the pinch comes and the insurgent West joins with the white South in demanding investigation, it is only the black politicians who are investigated while Slemp, Tolbert and their kind, go free.

    "text": "For several years after the World War I used to talk concerning the results of the War, and to say that notwithstanding the slaughter and the upheaval that always accompany war we were going to have in the world an extension of democracy as a result of the fighting; that the democracy which formerly had ruled in restricted fields - in the election of officials, in the so-called political world - we were going to see extended into industry, so that in regard to work and wages and income, we were going to have democratic control. But I write today to apologize and change my thesis. I was wrong in what I was predicting. I see today without any doubt that instead of the great question of democracy being an extension of democratic control into further territory, the problem that faces us in America and faces the world is the question as to whether we can keep the territory which we thought democracy had already conquered; that, as a matter of fact, in every single culture country there is today a fight to retain democracy, and that reaction and oligarchy are beginning to hold up their heads in the world and to triumph. Moreover, here in the United States, here where we have essayed the greatest experiment in democracy, we have perhaps the greatest failure.\nNothing could show this more than the present presidential campaign. There are momentous questions: the plight of American agriculture, the monopoly of water power, the role of organized wealth in industry, the future of organized labor, the distribution of national income. Most of these important questions we are not facing in this campaign. Why? Because the average voter does not understand how to face them. He finds himself vainly pawing the air in the so-called elections. He finds that he cannot exercise democratic control because he is not free to vote.\nIn the September Crisis I showed how, where and why American Negroes were not free to vote. But how about white Americans? Are they disfranchised?\nIt might be assumed that the practical disfranchisement of the great majority of Negroes chiefly by race and not by condition had no effect upon the state and nation, but simply upon them: but the singular thing is, and the point which this paper is seeking to emphasize, that this disfranchisement of the Negro has had an astonishing effect on the voting of other persons in the states concerned and in the whole nation so far as the mass of voters is concerned.\n\nFirst, in the Southern states it encourages oligarchy. Secondly, it enables cliques to nullify, not simply the 14th and 15th Amendments, but the 19th Amendment, giving the right vote to women, And finally, it entirely vitiates the normal distribution of voting power throughout the nation and makes a third party impossible. Let us take these points up in order.\nOne of the most interesting statements on clique government in the South comes from Henry W. Anderson, a rich white Virginia politician, who spoke at the Institute of Public Affairs held at the University of Virginia, August 19, 1927:\n\nThe Negroes were disfranchised. The Negro vote has since been so small that it is no longer a material factor in the political situation. But the process of disfranchisement did not stop there. The machinery of discrimination, devised primarily for this purpose, was then employed by the dominant party organization to effect a disqualification of a large proportion of the white population opposed to that organization, while unchallenged control of one political group permitted or encouraged political corruption. As a result of these measures the vote qualified or cast in the Southern States has been so reduced that it includes only a small minority of the population. So small is this vote that the State and local office-holders constitute or easily control a majority. Governors and other state officers are sometimes elected by less than 10 per cent of the population of voting age.\n\nLet us see how far we can illustrate this state of affairs by figures: we will take eleven Southern states - Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. We have the following facts as to the increase of population and of voting population in the presidential elections.\n\nPOPULATION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n1870\n8,228,826\n1900\n17,745,821\n\n\n1880\n11,457,878\n1910\n21,884,778\n\n\n1890\n14,197,747\n1920\n24,797,353\n\n\n\nThe presidential vote during this time has been as follows:\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n1872\n1,238,141\n1900\n1,572,414\n\n\n1876\n1,606,230\n1904\n1,091,679\n\n\n1880\n1,555,534\n1908\n1,302,664\n\n\n1884\n1,682,314\n1912\n1,538,386\n\n\n1889\n1,808,964\n1916\n1,857,240\n\n\n1892\n1,870,948\n1920\n2,662,588\n\n\n1896\n1,945,463\n1924\n2,865,747\n\n\n\nThe population in these states increased over 200 per cent since 1870, but the voting population has increased only 131% over 1872, despite woman suffrage. If we compare the population 1890-1920 and the voters 1892-1920, we find the population has increased 75% and the voters 42% despite the doubling of the electorate by woman suffrage. In other words, we have in the South today not only a nullification of the 15th but also of the 19th Amendment.\nMoreover, the increase of voting from 1904 to 1924 is mainly in North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas. If we take the five states of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina, we have this result:\n\nPOPULATION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n1870\n4,441,544\n1900\n8,318,238\n\n\n1880\n5,871,805\n1910\n9,716,116\n\n\n1890\n6,910,001\n1920\n10,517,957\n\n\n\n\n\nPRESIDENTIAL VOTE\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n1872\n661,770\n1900\n449,141\n\n\n1876\n844,001\n1904\n377,151\n\n\n1880\n701,066\n1908\n424,326\n\n\n1884\n619,166\n1912\n433,797\n\n\n1888\n629,675\n1916\n499,434\n\n\n1892\n693,127\n1920\n667,406\n\n\n1896\n598,092\n1924\n617,327\n\n\n\nWe can see here the enfranchisement of the Negro (1872-76). His disfranchisement first by intimidation (1880-84) and then by law (1892-1904); then a slow increase of the white vote, accelerated by the 19th Amendment in 1920 but checked in 1924.\nThe effect of the 19th Amendment is interesting: not only Negroes but white men of these states gradually stopped voting after Negro disfranchisement: the million voters of 1892 falling to less than 400,000 in 1904. A hundred thousand were added to the polls, 1904-16, although a million and a half had been added to the population. A hundred and fifty thousand women came to the polls right after the adoption of the woman’s suffrage amendment out of a possible two million and 50,000 of these disappeared four years later in spite of a million increase in population.\nIn other words, in these five states, out of a total of 5,145,282 persons 21 years of age and over, there were 635,512 votes cast in 1920. There were in this election, therefore, disfranchised voluntarily or involuntarily, 4,489,770 persons. Subtracting 19,000 Negroes as actually voting from the total number of Negroes 21 years of age and over, we have 2,215,991 Negroes disfranchised. But we also have 2,297,799 whites disfranchised, which is a fair indication of the cost of Negro disfranchisement in these five states.\n\nVOTERS - SOUTH - 1920\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite\nNegro\nTotal\nVotes\nDisfranchised\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n403,061\n376,930\n779,991\n66,150\n713,841\n\n\nGeorgia\n846,276\n575,330\n1,421,606\n148,716\n1,272,890\n\n\nAlabama\n702,265\n441,130\n1,143,395\n241,070\n902,325\n\n\nMississippi\n422,443\n453,663\n876,106\n82,492\n793,614\n\n\nLouisiana\n564,993\n359,251\n924,184\n117,084\n807,100\n\n\n\n———–\n———–\n———–\n————\n—————\n\n\n\n2,919,038\n2,206,304\n5,145,282\n635,512\n4,489,770\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Negroes Voting\nNegroes Disfranchised\nWhites Disfranchised\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n2,000\n374,930\n337,721\n\n\nGeorgia\n10,000\n565,330\n703,580\n\n\nAlabama\n5,000\n436,130\n464,191\n\n\nMississippi\n1,000\n451,130\n342,484\n\n\nLouisiana\n1,000\n358,251\n449,849\n\n\n\n——————\n———————–\n———————-\n\n\n\n19,000\n2,215,771\n2,297,799\n\n\n\nThere is one consideration which, in the opinion of some, modifies these figures. In each one of these states there is practically but one party and a “white primary.” Ostensibly to make the exclusion of the Negro voter doubly sure a system came into vogue by which only white voters are admitted to the dominant party primary and the condition of admittance was a promise to abide by the decision of the primary.\nThis means that in order to vote at all the white voter must first disenfranchise himself so far as having any voice as to the major principles which form the chief matters of difference between parties. Practically his vote is confined to choosing between individuals who will carry out principles which he must accept before voting at all. If, for instance, a Southern white man wants to vote in the Democratic primary this year, he can only do so if he gives up his right to vote against Al Smith!\nIn four of the states mentioned, 229,619 people voted in the regular election, while 722,271 voted in the primary election. If it is assumed that participation in the primary is some index of political interest, then the vote of the five states that we are studying ought to be quoted as 1 ⅓ million rather than 600,000. But even this is not more than a third the number of voters that a normal population of 10 ½ millions should furnish under universal suffrage. It shows, not simply the disfranchisement of practically all of the Negro voters, forming 40% of the population in these states, but that even if we give some weight to the “white primary” nearly two million white voters were simultaneously disfranchised.\nIn other words, the effort to disfranchise a million and a half Negro voters has cost the disfranchisement of nearly two million white voters, even if one assumes that the primary election is a fair example of the exercise of political power, which, of course, it is not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Alleged Failure of Democracy (1914)\nThe Possibility of Democracy (1928)\nClose Ranks (1918)\nA Philosophy in Time of War (1918)\nThe League of Nations (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “The Possibility of Democracy in\nAmerica.” The Crisis 35 (10): 336, 353--355. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/10/possible_democracy.html."

    "text": "The political theory of the Third Party in a Republican form of Government is that when the two chief parties cease to stand for distinct policies and principles, one of them will disappear, or the two will coalesce, and that a Third Party will arise and become one of the main contenders for the popular vote. In this way, it is assumed that there will always be a real difference of aim and principle between the main political parties. It was thus that the Republican Party arose and triumphed in the election of Abraham Lincoln. In this way the English Liberal Party displaced the Whigs, and the Labor Party now bids fair to displace the Liberals.\nMany Americans place their hopes of political reform in the United States on the rise of a Third Party which will register the fact that the present Republican and Democratic parties no longer differ in any essential respect. That both represent the rule of organized wealth, and neither of them has been willing to take radical ground with regard to the tariff, the farmer, labor, or the Negro.\nThe efforts, however, to organize a Third Party movement have not been successful. The Populists failed. The Socialists failed. The Progressives failed. The Farmer-Labor movement Many reasons have been advanced for these failures, but by common consent the real effective reason has seldom been discussed and that reason is in the Solid South: the fact is that no party in American politics can disappear if it is sure of 136 electoral votes.\nThis number of votes the Democratic Party is practically sure of in the Solid South: Virginia, 12; North Carolina, 12; Tennessee, 12; South Carolina, 9; Georgia, 14; Florida, 6; Alabama, 12; Mississippi, 10; Arkansas, 9; Louisiana, 10; Oklahoma, 10; Texas, 20.\nThere is a possibility that Tennessee’s 12 votes might now and then be cast for the Republican Party and a still slimmer possibility of Oklahoma’s 10, and North Carolina’s 12. For the most part, however, a presidential election in the United States has to do only with 395 of the 531 electoral votes. In order to win an election, a party must carry 266 votes. Any Third Party, therefore, in the United States to be successful would have to find its 266 votes among the 395 votes.\nIt must receive all but 29 of the electoral votes of the North and West. If it fails to do this, then it not only fails to carry the election, but it throws the election into the hands of the least liberal of the two old parties.\nThe least liberal party must be the Democratic Party because that party must place its main dependence upon the Solid South. The Solid South has the greatest percentage of illiteracy, the greatest percentage of lynchings and lawlessness, the greatest amount of religious bigotry, the least liberal laws as to labor of men, women and children, and is, in fine, because of its economic history, the most backward part of the whole nation. It does not make any difference how far the Democratic Party of the North may be stirred by liberal leanings, its very dependence upon the Solid South compels it to be a reactionary party. We might, of course, imagine liberal and radical elements among the Democrats making a strong appeal to the party and to the nation, but could we imagine any such political leadership voluntarily relinquishing 136 electoral votes?\nSuppose we represent the electoral vote of the United States by the figure 16, and assume that today this power is divided almost evenly between Democrats and Republicans, each with 8 votes. To 4 of these votes, cast by the Democrats and representing the Solid South, a Third Party could make no appeal at all. This would leave 12 votes open to liberal appeal. Assume that the principles of the Third Party are so strong and compelling that they convince half of those voters; that is, half of those open to conviction. What is the result? The result is the triumph of the Democratic Party by a vote of 7 Democrats, 6 Third Party men, and 3 Republicans. This illustrates what is bound to take place as long as there is a Solid South.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThird Party (1929)\nThe Election (1914)\nHow Shall We Vote (1920)\nThe Campaign of 1928 (1928)\nA New Party (1930)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “A Third Party.” The Crisis\n35 (11): 381. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/11/third_party.html."

    "text": "Lothrop Stoddard, professional “nigger” hater and protagonist of the Ku Klux Klan, made two astonishing admissions the other night when he debated the subject of social equality with the Editor of The Crisis.\nThe first was this: “The basic reason for white America’s attitude and policy toward the Negro is not a belief in the Negro’s inferiority, but the fact of his difference.” This is a shifting of ground which was bound to come, but we had not expected it so soon or from such a source.\nNo sooner, however, had Mr. Stoddard made this admission, than he was faced with this statement from Mr. Du Bois.\n\nMr. Stoddard declares that his chief solicitude is to preserve racial differences. Very well. Preserve them. But do not wreck civilization in so doing. Be generous and truthful in your estimate of other races. Give them every chance for development and open recognition of their accomplishment. Meet them as men. Talk with them. Confer with them. Only in this way can the differences be appreciated and understood and used for the glory of mankind.\nIf you wish to invite black men or yellow men to dinner, do so. If you do not, refrain from it; but do not shut restaurants in their faces; and should you meet them at someone’s else table, act as though you were a gentleman.\nAll this; and beyond this no one need go unless they wish. If any white person does not want to marry a colored person, no one is going to compel him. If he is asked, he has simply to say no.\nIf Mr. Stoddard were speaking pontifically for everybody in the white race, there would be absolutely no need of his silly bi-racial program. But, of course, Mr. Stoddard has no business to speak for every single white person just as I cannot speak for all black people. Now what are you going to do with the white man who is determined to marry a black woman? Shall you put him in jail, as in Mississippi? That method has been tried and failed. What we black Americans suggest is, that if they want to get married, let them be married, openly and legally.\nWe assume that there are comparatively few black and white people in the United States, who want to get married; we believe that if marriage is free, and social intercourse takes place on the highest and best levels, that, insofar as there are good and sufficient reasons in science and taste to keep people from marrying outside of their particular group, such marriages will not take place in the vast majority of cases. It would be an astounding admission, and the utter negation of his own argument, if Mr. Stoddard had to admit that free social intercourse among intelligent white and colored people in the United States was going to lead to wholesale intermarriage.\nI believe that there would be less intermingling of blood between the white and black group in the United States under the open abolition of the color line, than there is today under its futile and impossible enforcement. If the granting of social equality and equal opportunity for black folk would lead to making America a nation of octoroons, then this would be overwhelming proof that white people of the United States wanted a thing which Mr. Stoddard is carefully and elaborately denying, and with which denial I perfectly agree.\nIt is unfortunate that most white people arguing this question always leap straight to this extreme problem of the amalgamation of races. I ask for a decent seat in the theater, and my white neighbor answers, ‘Do you want to marry my daughter?’ And if I protest that really that wasn’t in my mind, he looks at me suspiciously and then says: ‘Well, what is it that you Negroes do want?’ His whole attitude and implication is, that as a matter of fact, what Negroes want is intermarriage and amalgamation.\nIn truth, what they want is equality and opportunity. If a group finds, that in the long run, it can only get equal treatment by disappearing as a group, it disappears, and nothing that Mr. Stoddard or any of his friends can do, will keep America from becoming octoroon if they persist in the present drawing of the color line. On the other hand, if the time comes when an American can be black and have the same opportunities as though he were white, why should he change the color of his skin? Does Mr. Stoddard really think that white people are so obviously and remarkably more gifted, good and beautiful than black people or brown people or yellow people, that these darker races are trying to commit racial suicide?\n\nAnd what does Mr. Stoddard answer? His answer is, in effect: “If the higher classes should give Negroes this treatment socially, see how much intermarriage it would lead to among the mass of people!”\nOr, in other words, the only way to keep the mass of white Americans from marrying Negroes is to lie about Negroes and lynch them and insult them. This proves what we have always said: the guilt for lynching lies not on the morons and criminals who pull the rope, it lies at the door of the educated and thoughtful Christians of America who refuse to attack race prejudice even when they know it is based on a lie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nA Statement (1919)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nThe Chicago Debate (1929)\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Race Segregation (1934)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Social Equality.”\nThe Crisis 35 (2): 61–62. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/02/social_equality.html."

    "text": "Second Installment Based on an Investigation Made by the N.A.A.C.P. in October, 1927\n“No One Has Gone Hungry, Unclothed, Unprotected,” Herbert Hoover\nMISSISSIPPI\nThe Situation\nEach large plantation is farmed by a number of tenants, or sharecroppers, who are furnished with houses and living through the year by the planter. That is, they are given credit at the plantation store and “Christmas money” for the holidays. In the fall when the crop is in, the amount of the tenant’s indebtedness is, theoretically, subtracted from the amount coming to him as his share of the crop and the balance is paid to him. The planter, of course, keeps the amount of indebtedness higher than the value of the crop, and by this method can hold the tenant to work for another year under the same contract. Practically all such tenants are Negroes and in some cases there are several hundred families held in this kind of peonage on one plantation.\nThe Yazoo-Mississippi Delta is a one-crop country. The planter is a gambler, who stakes all he has each year on cotton. One successful year will make him rich. For five or six years he has been losing steadily. The price of cotton went down until last year it reached a point so low that a few planters refused to sell. Those who happened to store their crop in a high place sold this year at a high profit. With the exception of these the entire Delta, bankrupt before the flood, was left in a hopeless condition by the disaster. Practically all of the plantations were already mortgaged for more than their actual value. The mortgages are, for the most part, held by insurance companies. Plantations are financed each year by a “furnish loan” from a local bank. This is actually a mortgage on a potential crop. The amount of the loan is based on the amount of land and labor. The planter must show that he has a tenant family to every twenty acres. The loan is used for all the year’s expenses—seed, feed for the stock and food, clothing, etc., for the tenants. The planter is thus dependent on his tenants and obliged for his existence to hold them on his land by fair means or foul.\nThere is an understanding to the effect that a disaster which destroys the year’s crop automatically cancels the contract. Therefore after a serious overflow, if a share-cropper wishes to leave a plantation he feels free to do so. At such times the planter often resorts to any pressure possible to keep his tenants from leaving him. The unwritten law in Mississippi is that no plantation owner will try to entice labor away from another plantation. Anyone who is suspected of this crime is despised and outcast. Therefore the labor agent, whose business it is to do this, is considered the most contemptible of men. He must carry on his work in secrecy, for if it were definitely known, he would certainly be treated with violence, if not lynched.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Planter and the Red Cross\nIn the early days of the flood of 1927, when it became apparent that their land would be inundated, the planters were greatly alarmed. They opposed the plan of the Red Cross to remove their Negro labor to refugee camps because, as they stated plainly, if the Negroes once got away they would never get them back. It was at that time not generally believed that the flood would be of any great duration and most of the planters felt that the Negroes could be cared for safely in buildings on the plantations. They opposed the Red Cross policy with enough vigor to handicap the rescue work seriously. In order to get their cooperation the Red Cross made an agreement with them, pledging themselves to return the tenants to the plantations from which they came. By this agreement the Red Cross assumed the responsibility not only of caring for the tenants during the period of emergency relief, but of protecting plantation owners against labor agents and of persuading and coercing those tenants who did not wish to return to their plantations. Miss Wagner who was in charge of work in the refugee camp at Natchez told me of this agreement and I had the same statement from Miss Pauline Marshall who was in charge at Vicksburg. The arrangement could hardly have been carried out, however, without the hearty cooperation of the National Guard. The Guardsmen, under the direction of the Red Cross, were in charge of the refugee camps in most places, with police and sentry duty. No one was allowed to enter or leave camp without a pass, except at the discretion of the Captain in charge. By these means (as previously reported) the refugees were prevented from leaving without the approval of the Red Cross and labor agents were kept from making contacts with them.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Evacuation of the Camps\nIn spite of this agreement many of the planters continued to be uneasy in regard to their labor and as soon as the water showed signs of receding they began to send for their tenants. Early in May, while boat-loads of refugees were still coming in to Vicksburg from the Yazoo and Sunflower Rivers, plantation managers from Washington County were coming after their Negro tenants. The plantation owner sent to the Red Cross a statement that his land was dry, or partly dry and that he wished his tenants returned, and enclosed a list of their names. The Red Cross worker located them in camp or in town and ordered them to be ready to leave on the day set. The refugees protested both because they did not wish to return to the plantations and because they knew their homes were still under water. They were forced to do so by the combined bullying of the Red Cross workers, the National Guard and the plantation manager. Attempts to remonstrate or argue were usually met by: “Shut up and get on that truck”—sometimes with a threat from a Guardsman of what would happen if they refused. They never did refuse. Instead they returned to the plantations where they stayed in barns or other buildings from which the water had receded or in Red Cross tents pitched on the wet, soggy “dry land.” On the Dawson Plantation at Cary fifty Negro families lived in a colored church for weeks. In the midst of this premature evacuation of camp came the unexpected second rise early in June and even these places of refuge were again flooded. Some of the refugees were sent back to camp, or found their way there alone; but the majority stayed in the vicinity, on the levee or some high place, enduring acute misery rather than return to the brutal treatment of the National Guard. Rations were furnished to them by the Red Cross, usually being issued to the planter or his manager and distributed by him to the tenants.\nThe June rise postponed the evacuation of camps a very little. Red Cross orders were to send the refugees back as rapidly as possible. At Vicksburg both colored camps were closed before the end of June although the white camp was kept until the twenty-second of August. The reason for this haste is not quite clear as it was far easier and simpler to care for the people in a concentrated camp than scattered about the country. Economy is a possible motive, but it seems safe to assume that the actual reason was the demand of the planters.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRationing on plantations was done on the basis of a list of needy families furnished by the plantation owner or manager, but the actual distribution was generally delegated to the store keeper. As the plantation stores had been flooded with a consequent heavy loss the store-keeper (who may have been the owner or manager also) took this opportunity to renew the stock, putting the fresh Red Cross supplies in their store-rooms and rationing the people with the wormy flood-damaged goods from their shelves. This was a very common practice and one of which there is no question. It was almost universal in Issaqueena County and in Washington County except around Greenville and also occurred very often in Sharkey and Warren Counties, though less openly. The Red Cross was entirely aware of the practice and in some cases tried to put a stop to it. The only way this would have been possible would have been to have all rationing done through Red Cross workers from Red Cross store-rooms, to individuals. This would have been certain to cause bad feeling between the Red Cross and the planters and was therefore not to be contemplated. Instead they allowed the Negroes to return to live in houses which had been under water in many cases as long as three months, and to be rationed on spoiled food until a serious outbreak of pellagra resulted. A doctor who had charge of Red Cross cases on three plantations (Dr. Westmoreland of Murphy, Miss.) said there was a case of pellagra in practically every tenant house and frequently every member of a family was ill. In his opinion it was entirely due to the Red Cross rationing and could easily have been prevented by a better chosen ration list and avoiding the distribution of spoiled food. Somewhat tardily the Red Cross “rallied to meet a new need” and imported several car-loads of powdered yeast for the treatment of the disease, and in addition distributed sweet potato plants. In some cases these were given directly to the Negroes, but very often they were given to the planter, the understanding being that he would plant them all and divide the crop among the tenants.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Rehabilitation of Tenants\nThe original plan and intention of the Red Cross was to have each tenant or flood victim visited by the worker in charge. The houses were to be seen, the statement of losses and needs confirmed, and household goods awarded on this basis. The losses of Negro tenants consisted chiefly of furniture and clothing, the latter being replaced during the emergency period from the quantities of second-hand clothing contributed. Occasionally mules or other stock were reported in the lists of losses but I have not heard that they were ever replaced except to white people, although they may have been in exceptional cases.\nTo replace household goods the Red Cross has purchased goods in quantity and distributed them as needed. The cost has been kept to an incredibly small amount. T. R. Buchanan, Red Cross Area Director in Washington County, told me that a family of five with a total loss was rehabilitated for $20.00. A bed cost approximately $2.00, chairs fifty cents, etc. The grade of goods may be judged fairly by the prices.\nThe fairness of the distribution depended upon the Red Cross worker in charge. In some places the worker had actually carried out the instructions in the simplest way, visited the houses, noted the losses, and sent out supplies according to the need. These places were very rare. The usual method was for the worker to talk to the planter, interview a few tenants at the plantation store, and send a more or less haphazard selection of furniture to the store-keeper to be distributed by him. This again gave the store keeper an opportunity to replenish his stock. As they did with food, they also put Red Cross furniture in their store-rooms and disbursed instead their own damaged goods. Later they can charge the tenants a high price for these things. I was told by many people, among them Miss Gail Bradley, one of the best Red Cross workers, that it was well known that many plantation stores have on hand enough Red Cross supplies to carry them through the winter.\nThe rehabilitation of the section around Hollandale had been finished and the worker, Miss Marion Wald had left when I visited this section. This area included Murphy and the Houston Plantation. I found that Miss Wald had not been inside of any of the houses but had decided the probable needs of the families by her imagination. I visited cabin after cabin in this neighborhood, and found in all of them the same picture of utter dreariness and desolation, accepted with incredible patience and uncomplaining fortitude. In the white tenant houses I found an adequate amount of furniture given by the Red Cross, and a vastly more hopeful outlook in every respect, but a general attitude of bitter resentment because they had not received more.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe first house I visited was one to which I was taken by Dr. Westmoreland to see a special case of pellagra. It was a two-roomed shanty which had been under water for more than two months. Water was still standing in the yard when the family moved back. The mud and filth had been scrubbed away but had left its mark which no scrubbing could remove. Two rusty iron beds stood in one room. On one of them, on a new Red Cross mattress, wrapped in musty, smelly bedding, was a week-old baby. The mattress for the other bed was on the floor, because the bed-springs had rusted completely away and no others had been provided. The rest of the furniture had either been destroyed or swept away by the swift current. Beside the mattresses the Red Cross had given them four straight chairs, so cheaply made that they were already coming apart and a tiny stove, scarcely two feet high even when set up on two layers of bricks. They had no dishes, cooking utensils, table, or bedding. There were four children beside the baby, one of them seriously ill with pellagra, and three adults. They had received no rations for six weeks and the man had neither work nor credit. This I soon found was not an exceptional, but a very typical case. Near by on Houston Brothers’ Plantation I saw a man named Enoch Williams who had a family of five and had lost everything he owned. His Red Cross award had consisted of four chairs. His “boss-man” gave him cotton to fill two bed ticks. They were cooking over a camp-fire in utensils they had found in the wreckage beside the river. Another man on the same plantation, named John Williams, with a family of five, also had a total loss. His son is in the last stages of tuberculosis. They received from the Red Cross one blanket, one mattress, one chair. They searched among the wreckage that is strewn along the banks of the river and found a few broken pieces of furniture which they have propped up with bricks and now using.\nIn this same neighborhood, I was told by a reputable white man, that the emergency rations first issued included, beside the regular ration list, such things as canned sweet potatoes, peaches, sardines and sausages. These were issued to the store managers for distribution to the tenants, but were divided among the white people in the locality. There were no cases of pellagra among the whites.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn Sharkey County the first worker, Miss Moxley, caused so much dissatisfaction by her unfairness that a petition was circulated in Rolling Fork, and the Red Cross was asked to remove her. This was done and a man from Ohio was put in her place. Under his management there has been a decided improvement both in white and colored cases. A much better grade of furniture was purchased and the work was done on an actual individual basis, by the worker in charge. The same abuses continued on the plantations, but to a lesser degree and there was a serious effort to end them.\nIn Issaqueena County the situation is about the same as in Washington. Warren County is somewhat better. The man in charge for a time at Vicksburg was reprimanded I was told by Mr. John Cremer at National Headquarters because, as it was put, “he got so interested in the social situation that he forgot what he was there for.” It may be due to his interest that the plantations at Redwood, Yokena, Cedars and Glass showed much better conditions.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMigration from the Delta\nIn spite of the united efforts of the Red Cross and plantation owners to hold the Negroes on the land by force a general movement from the Delta began soon after the evacuation of the refugee camps. All tenant houses were damaged and many swept entirely away by the flood. At first a few families, rather than endure the misery of living in make-shift temporary quarters until the rehabilitation program could be carried out, went at once to the hills or upper Delta, where there was plenty of work to be had. Others waited to see what the Red Cross was going to do, but it soon became clear that it would do so little as to be negligible. Ten or twelve dollars’ worth of cheap household goods was not worth enduring unnecessary hardships for. More and more families packed up their few belongings and left.\nThose who could get the means went further, to St, Louis, Chicago and Detroit. Plantation owners grew alarmed and made severe threats. It became necessary to slip out by night. Guards were put on the plantation roads. Some families were caught on their way off from the plantations and were told that their property, household goods, stock, etc., belonged to the planter for debt. When they protested the property was taken and they were told that they could go, they were no longer wanted there. In spite of all the measures taken to prevent it the migration continued. W. A. Clements, a lawyer in Rolling Fork said that at that time, early in October, more than 60 per cent. of the Negroes of Sharkey, Issaqueena and Warren Counties had left and they were still going.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nFlood (1927)\nThe Fruit of the Tree (1913)\nInvestments (1921)\nThe Flood, the Red Cross and the National Guard (1928)\nToo Rich to be a Nigger (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “The Flood, the Red Cross and the National\nGuard.” The Crisis 35 (2): 41. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/02/the_flood_the_red_cross_and_the_national_guard.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There can be no doubt but what the whole economic future of the Negro in America is ready for new thought and new planning. All the old slogans and old advice are worthless. To ask an individual colored man today to go into the grocery business or to open a drygoods shop or to sell meat, shoes, candy, books, cigars, clothes or fruit is competition with the Chain Store, is to ask him to commit slow but almost inevitable economic suicide, unless he has some unusual local or personal advantage.\nThe individual shopkeeper is disappearing in the American world, and his place is being taken by great country-wide organizations which sell food, clothes, cars, coal, coffee, furniture and hundreds of other things to meet the needs of men; and sell them at a price which makes attempted competition futile. The managers of these stores are appointed, and usually no colored men need apply. The workers in the stores and factories are hired, either in agreement with unions that keep out Negroes, or on an open shop basis, where Negroes are admitted only at the lowest wages.\nIn general industry, Negroes can become common laborers, underpaid and thereby ousting white competitors and thus engendering deep racial hatreds. Only in exceptional cases do Negroes get a chance in the higher ranks of skilled laborers or as Foreman or Managers.\nIn the credit world Negroes get bank credit with much greater difficulty than white men of equal honesty and ability. Negro banks are small and in any crisis they are dependent on the white banks of the city, and, of course, on the great white banking ring of the country. If for any reason, any influential part of any community wishes to crush a Negro bank, the bank is worse than helpless. The story of Memphis confirms this.\nNearly all of the old independent trades are now part of highly organized combinations, financed with large capital: like bakers, blacksmiths, firemen, jewelers, cigar-makers, painters, cabinetmakers, shoemakers, tailors, upholsters, tinsmiths, and any number of others. Men in the building trades are at the mercy of powerful trade unions, contractors backed endless bank credit and real estate combinations. In transportation, the Negro is absolutely excluded by the railroad unions and only has a desperate chance as longshoreman and laborer.\nIn the whole realm of manufacturing under the factory system, the Negro is excluded by the trades union and the deliberate and wide spread agreement of employers. Outside the cigar-making factories and the needle trades, there are practically no Negro operatives in cotton mills, candy factories, furniture factories, grain mills, leather factories, brass, copper, lead and zinc mills, paper mills, textile mills and hundreds of the like.\nIn the realm of personal service, the Negro has a chance as porter and servant, and in service for his own race. In professional service we have a first-rate record of desert in medicine, dentistry, literature, law, music and teaching, and a long tradition in the ministry; but these professions depend on a strong wage earning and income receiving mass and this we grievously lack.\nIn agriculture, thirty years training by Hampton and Tuskegee has decreased the proportion of Negro farmers in the colored population, and so few of their graduates have become farmers that they refuse to publish the figures. Hampton and Tuskegee are not to blame for this. They attempted the impossible. Farming for white and black today in the United States is a failing, unprofitable business; and the efforts to help it—farm credits and farm relief,—are not for Negroes.\nIn the face of this situation, there is no organized and thoughtful effort toward reform. The industrial school never accomplished the object which it had in mind, and which it widely advertised. It has not filled the land with Negro carpenters, bricklayers, wagon-builders, cooks and printers. Only to a limited extent are such schools training artisans today and all of the major industrial schools are being transformed into colleges.\nWhat is to be done? There is to my mind only one way out: Manufacturing and consumers co-operation among the major part of twelve million people on a wide and ever-increasing scale. There must be the slow, but carefully planned growth of manufacturing trusts, beginning with the raising of raw material on Negro farms; extending to its transportation on Negro trucks; its manufacture in Negro factories; its distribution to Negro cooperative stores, supported by intelligent and loyal Negro consumers.\nSuch an organization is above and beyond race prejudice and trust competition. Once established on the basis of the English, Scandinavian, German and Russian co-operatives, it would insure the economic independence of the American Negro for all time.\nBeside this could grow credit systems and co-operative banks which could bring the Negro-American group into carefully articulated co-operation with the West Indies and South America; with West Africa and South Africa.\nIt is more than idiotic—it is criminal, for American Negroes to stagger blindly on, hugging the fond illusion that white philanthropy through industrial education, is going to furnish them with future steady employment and economic independence. It is equally idiotic to hope that white laborers will become broad enough or wise enough to make the cause of black labor their own. These things will never be done in our day. Our economic future lies in the hands of carefully trained thinkers, technical engineers, and the unswerving will to sacrifice on the part of intelligent masses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nInvestments (1921)\nThe Boycott (1930)\nBlessed Discrimination (1913)\nThe Present (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Our Economic Future.”\nThe Crisis 35 (5): 169–70. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/05/our_economic_future.html."

    "text": "If one slings out the Northern neck of Manhattan and flies to the left of the silver Sound, one swoops in time into the Golden River; and dodging on this sinuously, now right, now left, one comes after a hundred miles of lake, hill and mountain, in the Old Bay State. Then at the foot of the high Metacomet that takes a solemn decision: left is sweet, old Sheffield; but pass it stolidly by and slip gently right into tiny South Egremont which always seems to. There—where right again and slope the Egremont Plain and the House of the Black Burghardts.\nIt is the first home that I remember. There my mother was born and all her nine brothers and sisters. There perhaps my grandfather was born, although that I do not know. At any rate, on this wide and lovely plain, beneath the benediction of grey-blue mountain and the low music of rivers, lived for a hundred years the black Burghardt clan. Up and to the east on a hill of rocks was Uncle Ira; down and to the south was Uncle Harlow in a low, long, red house beside a pond—seas, house of secret passes, sudden steps, low, narrow doors and unbelievable furniture. And here right in the center of the world was Uncle Waller, as Grandfather Othello was called.\nIt was a delectable place—simple, square and low, with the great room of the fireplace, the flagged kitchen, half a step below, and the lower wood-shed beyond. Steep, strong stairs led up to Sleep, while without was a brook, a well and a mighty elm. At most was I born there myself—but Alfred Du Bois and Mary Burghardt honeymooned a year in town and then brought me as a baby back to Egremont Plain.\nI left the home as a child to live in town again and go to school. But for furtive glimpses I did not see the house again for more than a quarter century. Then riding near on a chance journey I suddenly was home-sick for that house. I came to the spot. There it stood, old, lonesome, empty. Its windows eyes stared blindly on the broad, black highway into New York. It seemed to have shrunk timidly into itself. It had lost color and fence and grass and its sister left and down the road and to the homes were gone—the right its gone with no stick nor stone to mark their burial.\nFrom that day to this I desperately wanted to own that house for no earthly reason that sounded a bit like sense. It was 130 long miles from my work. It was decrepit almost beyond repair save that into its tough and sturdy timbers the Black Burghardts had built so much of their own dumb pluck that— “Why the stairs don’t even creak!” said She, climbing gingerly aloft.\nBut I fought the temptation away. Yachts and country estates and limousines are not adapted to my income. Oh, I inquired of course. The replies were discouraging. And once every year or so I drove by and stared sadly; and even more sadly and brokenly the House of the Black Burghardts stared back.\nThen of a sudden Somebody whose many names and places I do not know sent secret emissaries to me on a birthday which I had firmly resolved not to celebrate. Sent emissaries who showed me all the Kingdoms of this World, including something in green with a cupola; and also The House; and I smiled at the House. And they said by telegram—“The House of the Black Burghardts is come home again—it is yours!”\nWhereat in great joy I celebrated another birthday and drew plans. And from its long, hiding place I brought out an old black pair of tongs. Once my grandfather, and mayhap his, used them in the great fireplace of the House. Long years I have carried them tenderly over all the earth. The sister shovel, worn in holes, was lost. But when the old fireplace rises again from the dead on Egremont Plain, its famed eyes shall see not only the ghosts of old Tom and his son Jack and his grandson Othello and his great grandson, me—but also the real presence of those iron tongs resting again in fire worship in The House of the Black Burghardts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEaster-Emancipation 1863-1913 (1913)\nBrothers, Come North (1920)\nThe Shadow of Years (1918)\nThe Migration of Negroes (1917)\nLight (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “The House of the Black Burghardts.”\nThe Crisis 35 (4): 133–34. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/04/black.html."

    "text": "The struggle for the liberation of the working classes in general and of the Negro race in America in particular is, of course, at bottom the same struggle. But great difficulty faces both the workers because the essential identity of the problem is not recognized either by white workingmen or black. Black workingmen are the heirs of every effort which the white working masses have made toward freedom: the bestowal of universal suffrage; the shortening of the hours of labor; the protection of women and children in industry; the recognition of the right to collective bargaining; and all the rest of the victories more or less completely won by the working class movement. Through these victories Negroes were emancipated from slavery in America; partially enfranchised; and given at least a fighting chance for a living wage. On the other hand, all this story has not been told Negroes and they are not born knowing all about it. The working class movement has seldom attempted any intelligent propaganda to let them know of the past struggle; the Negro home does not know it; and the Negro school does not teach it. And to make the matter worse, both white and black workingmen have come under the sinister influence of the white employer.\nThe white workingman has swallowed the white employer’s race prejudice, lock, stock and barrel; so that he doesn’t want to work beside Negroes; he doesn’t want to live in their neighborhood; he doesn’t want to vote for them or with them; he doesn’t want to share the same parks, movies, street cars and railway trains; and he doesn’t want anybody to think that he is as low as a Negro.\nThe black workingman has taken from the white employer a different set of beliefs, but equally composed of prejudices and assumptions. If he hunts a job, he is told that the white employer is willing to employ him but that the white workingmen will not work with him and that his only chance to work is to “scab.” And the difficulty is that this is largely true. He finds the white workingmen voting against his schools and civil rights and excluding him from his trade unions; and the white employer is not at all loath to let the Negro know these facts in detail.\nIn addition to this and on the positive side, through the white employer and capitalist the Negro receives many of the things which the City and State backed by the white workers’ vote refuse to give him: all of the Negro colleges; most of his secondary and high schools; a large part of the better school buildings have been the gift to him from white philanthropists and they stand as a tremendous bribe to make Negroes hate white fellow workers and look upon them as his enemies.\nAll this would be important if it affected only the United States where the Negro forms perhaps one-ninth of the working class. But with local differences all this is essentially true of the colored workers throughout the world and a majority of the world’s workers today are colored. White workers are today as yesterday voting armies and navies to keep. China, India, Mexico and Central America in subjection and being paid high wages to do this while “niggers” and “dagoes” and “chinks” starve, slave and die.\nWhat chance is there then for the real liberation of any working class until the white and colored workers who now compete for each other’s bread understand each other and know the history of the labor movement? And what better medium is there for understanding than periodicals, monthly, weekly and daily, widely disseminated, which tell the truth to both groups?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro and Labor (1922)\nEugene Debs (1926)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nOur Class Struggle (1933)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Black and White Workers.”\nThe Crisis 35 (3): 98. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/03/black_and_white_workers.html."

    "text": "So many persons have asked for the complete text of the address delivered by Dr. Du Bois at the Chicago Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People that we are publishing the address here.\nDo not doubt but there are some in this audience who are a little disturbed at the subject of this meeting, and particularly at the subject I have chosen. Such people are thinking something like this: “How is it that an organization like this, a group of radicals trying to bring new things into the world, a fighting organization which has come up out of the blood and dust of battle, struggling for the right of black men to be ordinary human beings—how is it that an organization of this kind can turn aside to talk about Art? After all, what have we who are slaves and black to do with Art?”\nOr perhaps there are others who feel a certain relief and are saying, “After all it is rather satisfactory after all this talk about rights and fighting to sit and dream of something which leaves a nice taste in the mouth.”\nLet me tell you that neither of these groups is right. The thing we are talking about tonight is part of the great fight we are carrying on and it represents a forward and an upward look—a pushing: onward. You and I have been breasting hills; we have been climbing upward; there has been progress and we can see it day by day looking back along blood-filled paths. But as you go through the valleys and over the foothills, so long as you are climbing, the direction,—north, south, east or west,—is of less importance. But when gradually the vista widens and you begin to see the world at your feet and the far horizon, then it is time to know more precisely whither you are going and what you really want.\nWhat do we want? What is the thing we are after? As it was phrased last night it had a certain truth: We want to be Americans, full-fledged Americans, with all the rights of other American citizens: But is that all? Do we want simply to be Americans? Once in a while through all of us there flashes some clairvoyance, some clear idea of what America really is. We who are dark can see America in a way that white Americans can not. And seeing our country thus, are we satisfied with its present goals and ideals?\nIn the high school where I studied we learned most of Scott’s “Lady of the Lake” by heart. In after life once it was my privilege to see the lake. It was Sunday. It was quiet. You could glimpse the deer wandering in unbroken forests; you could hear the soft ripple of romance on the waters. Around me fell the cadence of that poetry of my youth. I fell asleep full of the enchantment of the Scottish border. A new day broke and with it came a sudden rush of excursionists. They were mostly Americans and they were loud and strident. They poured upon the little pleasure boat,—men with their hats a little on one side and drooping cigars in the wet corners of their mouths; women who shared their conversation with the world. They all tried to get everywhere first. They pushed other people out of the way. They made all sorts of incoherent noises and gestures so that the quiet home folk and the visitors from other lands silently and half-wonderingly gave way before them. They struck a note not evil but wrong. They carried, perhaps, a sense of strength and accomplishment, but their hearts had no conception of the beauty which pervaded this holy place.\nIf you tonight suddenly should become full-fledged Americans; if your color faded, or the color line here in Chicago was miraculously forgotten; suppose, too, you became at the same time rich and powerful;—what is it that you would want? What would you immediately seek? Would you buy the most powerful of motor cars and outrace Cook County? Would you buy the most elaborate estate on the North Shore? Would you be a Rotarian or a Lion or a What-not of the very last degree? Would you wear the most striking clothes, give the richest dinners and buy the longest press notices?\nEven as you visualize such ideals you know in your hearts that these are not the things you really want. You realize this sooner than the average white American because, pushed aside as we have been in America, there has come to us not only a certain distaste for the tawdry and flamboyant but a vision of what the world could be if it were really a beautiful world; if we had the true spirit; if we had the Seeing Eye, the Cunning Hand, the Feeling Heart; if we had, to be sure, not perfect happiness, but plenty of good hard work, the inevitable suffering that always comes with life; sacrifice and waiting, all that—but, nevertheless, lived in a world where men know, where men create, where they realize themselves and where they enjoy life. It is that sort of a world we want to create for ourselves and for all America.\nAfter all, who shall describe Beauty? What is it? I remember tonight four beautiful things: The Cathedral at Cologne, a forest in stone, set in light and changing shadow, echoing with sunlight and solemn song; a village of the Veys in West Africa, a little thing of mauve and purple, quiet, lying content and shining in the sun; a black and velvet room where on a throne rests, in old and yellowing marble, the broken curves of the Venus of Milo; a single phrase of music in the Southern South—utter melody, haunting and—appealing, suddenly arising out of night and eternity, beneath the moon.\nSuch is Beauty. Its variety is infinite, its possibility is endless. In normal life all may have it and have it yet again. The world is full of it; and yet today the mass of human beings are choked away from it, and their lives distorted and made ugly. This is not only wrong, it is silly. Who shall right this well-nigh universal failing? Who shall let this world be beautiful? Who shall restore to men the glory of sunsets and the peace of quiet sleep?\nWe black folk may help for we have within us as a race new stirrings; stirrings of the beginning of a new appreciation of joy, of a new desire to create, of a new will to be; as though in this morning of group life we had awakened from some sleep that at once dimly mourns the past and dreams a splendid future; and there has come the conviction that the Youth that is here today, the Negro Youth, is a different kind of Youth, because in some new way it bears this mighty prophecy on its breast, with a new realization of itself, with new determination for all mankind.\nWhat has this Beauty to do with the world? What has Beauty to do with Truth and Goodness—with the facts of the world and the right actions of men? “Nothing,” the artists rush to answer. They may be right. I am but an humble disciple of art and cannot presume to say. I am one who tells the truth and exposes evil and seeks with Beauty and for Beauty to set the world right. That somehow, somewhere eternal and perfect Beauty sits above Truth and Right I can conceive, but here and now and in the world in which I work they are for me unseparated and inseparable.\nThis is brought to us peculiarly when as artists we face our own past as a people. There has come to us—and it has come especially through the man we are going to honor tonight*—a realization of that past, of which for long years we have been ashamed, for which we have apologized. We thought nothing could come out of that past which we wanted to remember; which we wanted to hand down to our children. Suddenly, this same past is taking on form, color and reality, and in a half shamefaced way we are beginning to be proud of it. We are remembering that the romance of the world did not die and lie forgotten in the Middle Age; that if you want romance to deal with you must have it here and now and in your own hands.\nI once knew a man and woman. They had two children, a daughter who was white and a daughter who was brown; the daughter who was white married a white man; and when her wedding was preparing the daughter who was brown prepared to go and celebrate. But the mother said, “No!” and the brown daughter went into her room and turned on the gas and died. Do you want Greek tragedy swifter than that?\nOr again, here is a little Southern town and you are in the public square. On one side of the square is the office of a colored lawyer and on all the other sides are men who do not like colored lawyers. A white woman goes into the black man’s office and points to the white-filled square and says, “I want five hundred dollars now and if I do not get it I am going to scream.”\nHave you heard the story of the conquest of German East Africa? Listen to the untold tale: There were 40,000 black men and the 4,000 white men who talked German. There were 20,000 black men and 12,000 white men who talked English. There were 10,000 black men and 400 white men who talked French. In Africa then where the Mountains of the Moon raised their white and snow-capped heads into the mouth of the tropic sun, where Nile and Congo rise and the Great Lakes swim, these men fought; they struggled on mountain, hill and valley, in river, lake and swamp, until in masses they sickened, crawled and died; until the 4,000 white Germans had become mostly bleached bones; until nearly all the 12,000 white Englishmen had returned to South Africa, and the 400 Frenchmen to Belgium and Heaven; all except a mere handful of the white men died; but thousands of black men from East, West and South Africa, from Nigeria and the Valley of the Nile, and from the West Indies still struggled, fought and died. For four years they fought and won and lost German East Africa; and all you hear about it is that England and Belgium conquered German Africa for the allies!\nSuch is the true and stirring stuff of which Romance is born and from this stuff come the stirrings of men who are beginning to remember that this kind of material is theirs; and this vital life of their own kind is beckoning them on.\nThe question comes next as to the interpretation of these new stirrings, of this new spirit: Of what is the colored artist capable? We have had on the part of both colored and white people singular unanimity of judgment in the past. Colored people have said: “This work must be inferior because it comes from colored people.” White people have said: “It is inferior because it is done by colored people.” But today there is coming to both the realization that the work of the black man is not always inferior. Interesting stories come to us. A professor in the University of Chicago read to a class that had studied literature a passage of poetry and asked them to guess the author. They guessed a goodly company from Shelley and Robert Browning down to Tennyson and Masefield. The author was Countée Cullen. Or again the English critic John Drinkwater went down to a Southern seminary, one of the sort which “finishes” young white women of the South. The students sat with their wooden faces while he tried to get some response out of them. Finally he said, “Name me some of your Southern poets.” They hesitated. He said finally, “I’ll start out with your best: Paul Laurence Dunbar!”\nWith the growing recognition of Negro artists in spite of the severe handicaps, one comforting thing is occurring to both white and black. They are whispering, “Here is a way out. Here is the real solution of the color problem. The recognition accorded Cullen, Hughes, Fauset, White and others shows there is no real color line. Keep quiet! Don’t complain! Work! All will be well!”\nI will not say that already this chorus amounts to a conspiracy. Perhaps I am naturally too suspicious. But I will say that there are today a surprising number of white people who are getting great satisfaction out of these younger Negro writers because they think it is going to stop agitation of the Negro question. They say, “What is the use of your fighting and complaining; do the great thing and the reward is there.” And many colored people are all too eager to follow this advice; especially those who are weary of the eternal struggle along the color line, who are afraid to fight and to whom the money of philanthropists and the alluring publicity are subtle and deadly bribes. They say, “What is the use of fighting? Why not show simply what we deserve and let the reward come to us?”\nAnd it is right here that the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People comes upon the field, comes with its great call to a new battle, a new fight and new things to fight before the old things are wholly won; and to say that the Beauty of Truth and Freedom which shall some day be our heritage and the heritage of all civilized men is not in our hands yet and that we ourselves must not fail to realize.\nThere is in New York tonight a black woman molding clay by herself in a little bare room, because there is not a single school of sculpture in New York where she is welcome. Surely there are doors she might burst through, but when God makes a sculptor He does not always make the pushing sort of person who beats his way through doors thrust in his face. This girl is working her hands off to get out of this country so that she can get some sort of training.\nThere was Richard Brown. If he had been white he would have been alive today instead of dead of neglect. Many helped him when he asked but he was not the kind of boy that always asks. He was simply one who made colors sing.\nThere is a colored woman in Chicago who is a great musician. She thought she would like to study at Fontainebleau this summer where Walter Damrosch and a score of leaders of Art have an American school of music. But the application blank of this school says: “I am a white American and I apply for admission to the school.”\nWe can go on the stage; we can be just as funny as white Americans wish us to be; we can play all the sordid parts that America likes to assign to Negroes; but for any thing else there is still small place for us.\nAnd so I might go on. But let me sum up with this: Suppose the only Negro who survived some centuries hence was the Negro painted by white Americans in the novels and essays they have written. What would people in a hundred years say of black Americans? Now turn it around. Suppose you were to write a story and put in it the kind of people you know and like and imagine. You might get it published and you might not. And the “might not” is still far bigger than the “might.” The white publishers catering to white folk would say, “It is not interesting”—to white folk, naturally not. They want Uncle Toms, Topsies, good “darkies” and clowns. I have in my office a story with all the earmarks of truth. A young man says that he started out to write and had his stories accepted. Then he began to write about the things he knew best about, that is, about his own people. He submitted a story to a magazine which said, “We are sorry, but we cannot take it.” “I sat down and revised my story, changing the color of the characters and the locale and sent it under an assumed name with a change of address and it was accepted by the same magazine that had refused it, the editor promising to take anything else I might send in providing it was good enough.”\nWe have, to be sure, a few recognized and successful Negro artists; but they are not all those fit to survive or even a good minority. They are but the remnants of that ability and genius among us whom the accidents of education and opportunity have raised on the tidal waves of chance. We black folk are not altogether peculiar in this. After all, in the world at large, it is only the accident, the remnant, that gets the chance to make the most of itself; but if this is true of the white world it is infinitely more true of the colored world. It is not simply the great clear tenor of Roland Hayes that opened the ears of America. We have had many voices of all kinds as fine as his and America was and is as deaf as she was for years to him. Then a foreign land heard Hayes and put its imprint on him and immediately America with all its imitative snobbery woke up. We approved Hayes because London, Paris and Berlin approved him and not simply because he was a great singer.\nThus it is the bounden duty of black America to begin this great work of the creation of Beauty, of the preservation of Beauty, of the realization of Beauty, and we must use in this work all the methods that men have used before. And what have been the tools of the artist in times gone by? First of all, he has used the Truth—not for the sake of truth, not as a scientist seeking truth, but as one upon whom Truth eternally thrusts itself as the highest handmaid of imagination, as the one great vehicle of universal understanding. Again artists have used Goodness—goodness in all its aspects of justice, honor and right—not for sake of an ethical sanction but as the one true method of gaining sympathy and human interest.\nThe apostle of Beauty thus becomes the apostle of Truth and Right not by choice but inner and outer compulsion. Free he is but his freedom is ever bounded by Truth and Justice; and slavery only dogs him when he is denied the right to tell the Truth or recognize an ideal of Justice.\nThus all Art is propaganda and ever must be, despite the wailing of the purists. I stand in utter shamelessness and say that whatever art I have for writing has been used always for propaganda for gaining the right of black folk to love and enjoy. I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda. But I do care when propaganda is confined to one side while the other is stripped and silent.\nIn New York we have two plays: “White Cargo” and “Congo.” In “White Cargo” there is a fallen woman. She is black. In “Congo” the fallen woman is white. In “White Cargo” the black woman goes down further and further and in “Congo” the white woman begins with degradation but in the end is one of the angels of the Lord.\nYou know the current magazine story: A young white man goes down to Central America and the most beautiful colored woman there falls in love with him. She crawls across the whole isthmus to get to him. The white man says nobly, “No.” He goes back to his white sweetheart in New York.\nIn such cases, it is not the positive propaganda of people who believe white blood divine, infallible and holy to which I object. It is the denial of a similar right of propaganda to those who believe black blood human, lovable and inspired with new ideals for the world. White artists themselves suffer from this narrowing of their field. They cry for freedom in dealing with Negroes because they have so little freedom in dealing with whites. DuBose Heywood writes “Porgy” and writes beautifully of the black Charleston underworld. But why does he do this? Because he cannot do a similar thing for the white people of Charleston, or they would drum him out of town. The only chance he had to tell the truth of pitiful human degradation was to tell it of colored people. I should not be surprised if Octavius Roy Cohen had approached the Saturday Evening Post and asked permission to write about a different kind of colored folk than the monstrosities he has created; but if he has, the Post has replied, “No. You are getting paid to write about the kind of colored people you are writing about.”\nIn other words, the white public today demands from its artists, literary and pictorial, racial pre-judgment which deliberately distorts Truth and Justice, as far as colored races are concerned, and it will pay for no other.\nOn the other hand, the young and slowly growing black public still wants its prophets almost equally unfree. We are bound by all sorts of customs that have come down as second-hand soul clothes of white patrons. We are ashamed of sex and we lower our eyes when people will talk of it. Our religion holds us in superstition. Our worst side has been so shamelessly emphasized that we are denying we have or ever had a worst side. In all sorts of ways we are hemmed in and our new young artists have got to fight their way to freedom.\nThe ultimate judge has got to be you and you have got to build yourselves up into that wide judgment, that catholicity of temper which is going to enable the artist to have his widest chance for freedom. We can afford the Truth. White folk today cannot. As it is now we are handing everything over to a white jury. If a colored man wants to publish a book, he has got to get a white publisher and a white newspaper to say it is great; and then you and I say so. We must come to the place where the work of art when it appears is reviewed and acclaimed by our own free and unfettered judgment. And we are going to have a real and valuable and eternal judgment only as we make ourselves free of mind, proud of body and just of soul to all men.\nAnd then do you know what will be said? It is already saying. Just as soon as true Art emerges; just as soon as the black artist appears, someone touches the race on the shoulder and says, “He did that because he was an American, not because he was a Negro; he was born here; he was trained here; he is not a Negro—what is a Negro anyhow? He is just human; it is the kind of thing you ought to expect.”\nI do not doubt that the ultimate art coming from black folk is going to be just as beautiful, and beautiful largely in the same ways, as the art that comes from white folk, or yellow, or red; but the point today is that until the art of the black folk compells recognition they will not be rated as human. And when through art they compell recognition then let the world discover if it will that their art is as new as it is old and as old as new.\nI had a classmate once who did three beautiful things and died. One of them was a story of a folk who found fire and then went wandering in the gloom of night seeking again the stars they had once known and lost; suddenly out of blackness they looked up and there loomed the heavens; and what was it that they said? They raised a mighty cry: “It is the stars, it is the ancient stars, it is the young and everlasting stars!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNegro Art (1921)\nMencken (1927)\nThe Black Man and the Unions (1918)\nMuddle (1916)\nWhite Co-Workers (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “Criteria of Negro Art.”\nThe Crisis 32 (6): 290–97. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/32/06/criteria_of_negro_art.html."

The Southern states are still incapable of punishing lynchers. Even men whom the courts have declared innocent have been seized by mobs and lynched and then those same courts were unable to punish the lynchers.\nThe Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill is before the Congress. The South is cowering and complaining. The Galveston News calls it “legislation by revenge.” The Columbia, S. C. State calls it “rotten politics” to “incite race feeling.” The Houston, Texas Post sees an “invasion” of state rights. The New Orleans Picayune declares it “unconstitutional,” etc.\nIs it revenge to stop public murder? Is it politics to stop lynching? Is it unconstitutional to enforce Section 1 of the 14th Amendment which says that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”?\nIf any Southern state does not want its rights “invaded,” let it stop lynching or punish the lynchers. If it cannot do this the United States government must and will. If the men like Dyer and McKinley who have pushed this bill are playing petty politics then the Negro voter answers simply that that is precisely the kind of petty politics he wants played; that he doesn’t care a rap whether the senators and representatives who are pushing this legislation love him or hate him, are actuated by the highest patriotism or the lowest selfishness. What he wants is that they should push the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill and he is going to vote for any man who does it and against any man who doesn’t.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLynching (1927)\nCrime and Lynching (1912)\nLynching (1914)\nLynching (1911)\nAnti-Lynching Legislation (1922)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “Lynching.” The Crisis 32\n(1): 10. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/32/01/lynching.html."

By so doing she will distract the attention of her citizens and direct it toward the glories of ancient Rome. When Mussolini looks for territory in which Italy may expand, whither does he cast his eye? Let no foolish person think that he is going to war in order to seize territory from France in Africa or in Syria; or that he has any idea of threatening the British Empire; or that he is going even to attack Turkey unless he can get some foolish little country like Greece to do it for him.\nWhat Italy wants is Abyssinia. She has wanted Abyssinia a long time. When the Mahdi overthrew the English in the Sudan, the English with great generosity gave Italy the chance to seize Abyssinia and Italy foolishly attempted it. But at the great Battle of Adua, March 1, 1896, the Abyssinians, under the leadership of Menelik and the Empress Taitou, killed four thousand Italians and captured two thousand prisoners. Since then England, France and Italy have been content to draw a cordon around Abyssinia and bide their time. They have tied up her economic resources, taxed her exports and imports and mortgaged her railroads and such other tangible assets as they could get hold of. It is time now for a further step.\nIn the secret Treaty of London which induced Italy to desert her allies, Germany and Austria, and to take active part with England and France, Italy was promised not only increase of territory at the expense of Austria, but the right to extend her possessions in “Eritrea, Somaliland and Libya”; and since these extensions could not be into the ocean, they must be into Abyssinia. With a number of fine flourishes, Italy is now demanding cash for this check and although the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations and the Peace of Locarno stand straight across her path, there is every reason to believe that England would be delighted to have Italy in Abyssinia and that France would offer no great objection. Indeed, the only country that is offering any open objection to this high-handed program of theft, lying and slavery is Soviet Russia.\nYet the world has seen the path preparing for many a day. First there was the righteous horror of England against “slavery” in Abyssinia. Then there was the problem of allowing arms to be “smuggled” into Abyssinia. And then there was the unexpected and unwelcomed and yet effusively received visit of Ras Tafari to Europe. Only America with blunt boorishness refused him hospitality.\nHere then is the problem and the program and already Italy is beginning actual aggression by putting down, with world applause, a “rebellion” in Somaliland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWorld War and the Color Line (1914)\nChristianity Rampant (1911)\nSketches from Abroad (1924)\nHelping Africa (1924)\nTo Mr. Emmett Scott (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “Italy and Abyssinia.”\nThe Crisis 32 (2): 62–63. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/32/02/italy_and_abyssinia.html."

    "text": "It is customary to regard Negroes as an essentially dramatic race; and it is probably true that tropical and sub-tropical peoples have more vivid imagination, are accustomed to expressing themselves with greater physical and spiritual abandon than most folk. And certainly, life as black and brown and yellow folk have known it is big with tragedy and comedy. The home life of Africans shows this natural dramatic tendency; the strides of the native African, the ceremony of home and assembly, the intense interest in music and play, all attest this.\nIn America, on the other hand, the road to freedom for the Negro lay through religious organization long before physical emancipation came. The Negro church gave the slave almost his only freedom of spirit and of the churches that came to proselyte among the slaves, only those were permanently successful which were strongly tinged with Puritanism, namely: the Baptist and the Methodist. These churches frowned upon drama and the play, upon the theatre and the dance; and for this reason the American Negro has been hindered in his natural dramatic impulses.\nToday as the renaissance of art comes among American Negroes, the theatre calls for new birth. But most people do not realize just where the novelty must come in. The Negro is already in the theatre and has been there for a long time; but his presence there is not yet thoroughly normal. His audience is mainly a white audience, and the Negro actor has, for a long time, been asked to entertain this more or less alien group. The demands and ideals of the white group and their conception of Negroes have set the norm for the black actor. He has been a minstrel, comedian, singer and lay figure of all sorts. Only recently has he begun tentatively to emerge as an ordinary human being with everyday reactions. And here he is still handicapped and put forth with much hesitation, as in the case of “The Nigger,” “Lulu Belle” and “The Emperor Jones.”\nIn all this development naturally then the best of the Negro actor and the most poignant Negro drama have not been called for. This could be evoked only by a Negro audience desiring to see its own life depicted by its own writers and actors.\nFor this reason, a new Negro theatre is demanded and it is slowly coming. It needs, however, guiding lights. For instance, some excellent groups of colored amateurs are entertaining colored audiences in Cleveland, in Philadelphia and elsewhere. Almost invariably, however, they miss the real path. They play Shakespeare or Synge or reset a successful Broadway play with colored principals.\nThe movement which has begun this year in Harlem, New York City, lays down four fundamental principles. The plays of a real Negro theatre must be: 1. About us. That is, they must have plots which reveal Negro life as itis. 2. By us. That is, they must be written by Negro authors who understand from birth and continual association just what it means to be a Negro today. 3. For us. That is, the theatre must cater primarily to Negro audiences and be supported and sustained by their entertainment and approval. 4. Near us. The theatre must be in a Negro neighborhood near the mass of ordinary Negro people.\nOnly in this way can a real folk-play movement of American Negroes be built up. Even this building encounters certain difficulties. First, there is the problem of the plays. Five years ago there were practically no plays that filled the specifications noted. Already, however, this situation has begun to change on account of the prizes offered by The Crisis magazine and other agencies and for other reasons. There are available today a dozen or more plays of Negro life worth staging and the quantity and quality will increase very rapidly as the demand grows. The problem of actors is the least of the difficulties presented. In any group of colored people it is possible to get an unusual number of persons gifted with histrionic ability. The only trouble comes when effort is made to select the actors from limited groups or exclusively from among social acquaintances or friends. The third difficulty, that of a suitable playhouse, is real and must be worked out as circumstances permit. There are usually halls that can be used temporarily. Now and then a church is liberal enough to house a play.\nIn the New York movement, advantage is being taken of the fact that in the center of Harlem there is a branch of the New York Public Library which has in its basement a lecture room. The administration of this library has in the last few years changed from an attitude of aloofness from its Negro surroundings, and even resentment, to an attitude which recognizes that this library is serving a hundred thousand Negroes or more. It specializes on books which Negroes want to read; it subscribes to their periodicals and has lectures and art exhibits which attract them.\nSome time ago Miss Ernestine Rose, the Librarian, suggested that a Little Theatre movement be started in connection with this library; but other activities interfered. This year the library authorities expressed their willingness to help equip a small and inexpensive stage in the lecture room and a group of 30 persons interested in such a theatre has been organized.\nForemost among these is Charles Burroughs. Charles Burroughs was trained in the college department of Wilberforce and at the School of Expression in Boston and has been a dramatic reader for many years for the Board of Education in New York City. He has been unusually successful in training actors as was shown by his training the groups which gave the pageant, “The Star of Ethiopia,” in New York, Washington, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.\nIn the Harlem Little Negro Theatre the library authorities built the stage and dressing rooms and furnished the lighting equipment. The players group furnished the curtain, the scenery, gave the plays and secured the audiences. Three one-act plays were selected, for the initial experiment. Two were tragedies by Willis Richardson: “Compromise,” which was published in The New Negro, and “The Broken Banjo,” which took the first prize in The Crisis Contest of 1925. The third, “The Church Fight,” by Mrs. R. A. Gaines-Shelton, is a comedy which took the second prize in The Crisis Contest of 1925. A cast of 20 persons was required and they rehearsed faithfully. Louise Latimer, assisted by Aaron Douglas, painted the scenery and on May 3, 10 and 17 the plays were given before full houses averaging 200 persons at each performance.\n The success of the experiment is unquestioned. The audiences were enthusiastic and wanted more. The price of admission to membership in the group which gave the right to see the performances was only 50 cents and the total expense of staging the plays, not counting expenditures by the Library, was about $165 while the returns were something over $240. The players not only perform plays but they welcome other groups under easy conditions to come and use their playhouse under their patronage.\nA second K. P. L. N. T. is being organized in Washington, D. C., and it is hoped the movement will spread widely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Book Shelf (1925)\nPrecept and Practice (1910)\nCorrespondence (1926)\nUnity (1924)\nPan-Africa and New Racial Philosophy (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “‘Krigwa Players Little Negro\nTheatre’.” The Crisis 32 (3): 134–36. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/32/03/kgriwa.html."

In such cases The Crisis is accustomed to suggest literature and other matter with the idea, not of influencing the student’s conclusions, but of impressing the size of the undertaking to which he so lightly turns. In some cases this does good. In the case of Mr. Charles Stelzle it did no good. Mr. Stelzle, who is “Executive Secretary of the Home Missions Council,” announced his intention last year of looking black men over. This year, in the midst of a busy life, he has thrown off an essay which has been published from New York to California, in which he calmly announces “that the death rate among Negroes is increasing, whereas it is decreasing among whites.” This extraordinary statement has been strewn over the United States and it is a flat and glaring falsehood.\nIn the Census of 1890, Vital and Social Statistics (Part I, page 30), and in the Census of 1900, Vol. III (Vital Statistics, part I, page 69), there are the following figures for colored people:\n\n\n\n\n1890\n1900\n\n\n\n\nDeath rates in registration area\n32.40\n30.2\n\n\nDeath rates in registration cities\n33.68\n31.1\n\n\nDeath rates in registration States\n29.50\n26.2\n\n\n\nHere is the clearest sort of proof that the Negro death rate is declining steadily.\nIf Mr. Stelzle had had time to go a bit further he would have found the following figures in the Census Mortality Statistics of 1908 (page 26).\nDeath rates of Negroes in selected registration cities:\n\n\n\n1901–05\n28.4\n\n\n1908–\n26.2\n\n\n\nIn other words, because a busy man was too careless to find out what he was talking about, a miserable falsehood is spread fro m ocean to ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nToward a New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nBrowsing Reader - The American Race Problem (1927)\nLight (1912)\nThe Truth (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Vital Statistics.”\nThe Crisis 4 (6): 291. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/06/vital_statistics.html."

    "text": "The woman suffragists are wincing a bit under the plain speaking of The Crisis. President Anna Shaw writes us:\n\nThere is not in the National Association any discrimination against colored people. If they do not belong to us it is merely because they have not organized and have not made application for membership. Many times we have had colored women on our program and as delegates, and I, personally, would be only too glad to welcome them as long as I am president of the National Association.\n\nAt the State convention in Ithaca a few days ago, when I was conducting the question box, I was asked what I did in Louisville in regard to admitting women of Negro blood to the convention and my reply was: ‘I did nothing in regard to admitting women of Negro blood to the convention. Our association does not recognize either Negro blood or white blood; what we stand for is the demand for equal political rights for women with men, and we know no distinction of race.’ Our whole contention is for justice to women, white and colored, and I do not think it will be possible ever to change the platform of the National Association in this respect.\n\nThe corresponding secretary has heard vague rumors in Ohio and says:\n\nA somewhat indefinite report has reached me that there is being circulated a statement to the effect that the committee on resolutions of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, at the last annual convention held in Louisville, Ky., ‘snowed under’ a resolution condemning disfranchisement of colored people in the South. As I remember the circumstance that probably gave rise to this misleading report it was as follows: In the hurry of the last meeting of the resolutions committee, which was composed of one member from each State, only a part of the committee being present, several resolutions on various subjects were presented, one being about as the above recites. I do not recall that it read ‘colored people,’ though it may have been meant to apply to them. No one objected in any way to its provisions, but one or two mentioned conditions in other parts of the United States which were against the free use of the ballot and said that the resolution was not broad enough. There was not time to discuss it fully, so this one and some other resolutions were not acted upon at all. Those who proposed any of the resolutions not acted upon by our committee had the opportunity and full liberty to present them from the floor, so that our committee did not feel that it was ‘snowing under’ that resolution, or any other, which it had not had time to revise to make comprehensive enough to include all similar abridgments of rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThe ballotless women, I can assure you, who attended that convention are working for, and urging with all their ability, strength and talents, the guarantee of civil and political rights for all citizens of the United States entitled to them.\n\nAll this is pleasant and encouraging, but does it present the facts in the case exactly? Early in August Miss Martha Gruening sought a chance to have a colored delegate introduce the following resolution at the Louisville convention and speak on the floor:\n\nResolved, that the women who are trying to lift themselves out of the class of the disfranchised, the class of the insane and criminal, express their sympathy with the black men and women who are fighting the same battle and recognize that it is as unjust and as undemocratic to disfranchise human beings on the ground of color as on the ground of sex.\n\nPresident Anna Shaw refused absolutely to invite the colored lady suggested and said over her signature several weeks before the convention:\n\nI must oppose the presentation of that resolution at our national convention. I do not feel that we should go into a Southern State to hold our national convention and then introduce any subject which we know beforehand will do nothing but create discord and inharmony in the convention. The resolution which you proposed to introduce would do more to harm the success of our convention in Louisville than all the other things that we do would do good. I am in favor of colored people voting, but white women have no enemy in the world who does more to defeat our amendments, when submitted, than colored men, and until women are recognized and permitted to vote, I am opposed to introducing into our women suffrage convention a resolution in behalf of men who, if our resolution were carried, would go straight to the polls and defeat us every time.\n\nWe have already shown that the statement that colored men oppose woman suffrage is false, and we have only to add that every effort was made to keep this resolution from being presented; and when it finally appeared it was incontinently sidetracked in committee. We are not surprised that under the circumstances the information of the corresponding secretary is “somewhat indefinite.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWoman’s Suffrage (1913)\nOur Program (1930)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nA Correspondence (1914)\nWhite Co-Workers (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Suffering Suffragettes.”\nThe Crisis 4 (2): 76–77. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/02/suffering_suffragettes.html."

It does not compel any German to marry a black or a brown woman. If Germans do not want a mixed mulatto progeny they may let the native woman alone. The law simply says that a marriage in fact is a marriage in law; that the virtue of a colored woman in the German colonies is to receive legal protection.\nThe simplest and barest demand of even half-civilized justice was not easily carried. It took the strength of Socialists and Catholics, fighting against the strongholds of German culture—the liberals and the aristocracy. Here were found the upholders of the dirtiest blot of modern white contact with backward races—the blot which makes the white Christian Church of the South to-day the strongest upholder of the system which denies all protection in law and custom to the helpless black girl before the lust of the white man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nInter-Marriage (1924)\nIntermarriage (1927)\nColor Caste in the United States (1933)\nCorrespondence (1926)\nIntermarriage (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Decency.” The Crisis 4 (2):\n77. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/02/decency.html."

    "text": "The invitation given me to contribute an article to the Woman Suffrage Number of The Crisis, and in it refer to the part that my father, William Lloyd Garrison played in the movement, brings to mind the fact that there are many people who are ignorant of the close relation that existed between the anti-slavery agitation and the one for “woman’s rights,” in both of which my father bore his share of the burdens. The very first lesson that I learned was one of sympathy for the poor little slave child who was torn away from its mother’s arms, and the second was the need of the help of women in the struggle to free the cruelly oppressed colored people from bondage.\nAt that time custom did not permit women to address audiences of both men and women; the only exception being that of the Society of Friends. Thus, when two women who had an intimate knowledge of the horrors of slavery desired to speak in churches, in order to reach a larger number of people and win adherents to the abolition cause, they were sternly rebuked for their temerity. These women were Sarah and Angelina Grimké, daughters of a distinguished judge of Charleston, S. C., both remarkably gifted speakers and able writers on this all-absorbing topic. Thereupon, the General Association of Massachusetts, having the Orthodox Congregational Churches under its care, issued in July, 1837, a pastoral letter. Its aim was to close the doors of churches to anti-slavery lecturers, and to diminish the audiences of the Grimké sisters, who during the month of June had aroused intense interest in Eastern Massachusetts by their eloquent appeals on behalf of the slaves. Attention was called to dangers now seeming “to threaten the female character with widespread and permanent injury.” The New Testament clearly defines “the appropriate duties and influences of women.” “The power of woman is in her dependence. … When she assumes the place and tone of man as a public reformer our care and protection of her seem unnecessary; we put ourselves in self-defense against her; she yields the power which God has given for her protection and her character becomes unnatural.” The conduct of those, the letter continued, is sadly mistaken “who encourage females to bear an obstrusive and ostentatious part in measures of reform, and countenance any of that sex who so far forget themselves as to itinerate in the character of public lecturers and preachers.”\nThe Grimké sisters then asked for permission to speak on the anti-slavery platform and were warmly welcomed by my father, who said that he owed a greater duty to women who were half the human race than he did to the slaves who were, happily, only a small part of it, and that he must be true to both. Some of the few adherents he had won left him, saying that he could free the slaves alone if he intended to allow women to speak at anti-slavery meetings.\nMiss Catherine Beecher’s newly published “Essay on Slavery and Abolitionism, with Reference to the Duty of American Females,” addressed to Miss A. E. Grimké, was really the beginning of the woman’s rights agitation in America. Sarah Grimké said in a letter to H. C. Wright: “The Lord … has very unexpectedly made us the means of bringing up the discussion of the question of woman’s preaching and all we have to do is to do our duty.” Angelina Grimké’s forceful reply to Miss Beecher was published in thirteen articles in the Liberator. My father said: “Are we enough to make a revolution? No, but we are enough to begin one, and once begun it never can be turned back.” This seems peculiarly applicable in the case of these devoted sisters.\nHe had an opportunity presented to him in London in 1840 to serve the woman’s rights cause which he did not fail to embrace. He had journeyed there for the express purpose of attending a world’s anti-slavery convention, which met or Friday, June 12, with about 500 delegates. His ship had been delayed by fog and adverse gales, and he arrived five days too late. The convention had but three days more to sit, and having learned that his women codelegates sent by the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Societies were denied admission to it because of their sex, my father took his seat with them in the gallery and refused to take part in the proceedings in order to do so.\nHe was in the company of such women as Harriet Martineau, Mrs. Wendell Phillips, Mrs. Maria Weston Chapman, Mrs. Lydia Maria Child, Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Miss Abby Kelley, afterward Mrs. Stephen Foster, Miss Emily Winslow, Miss Abby Southwick, Mrs. Lucretia Mott, and still others; certainly with his peers. This act, says N. P. Rogers, was decisive in its effect, “Haman never looked more blank on seeing Mordecai sitting in the king’s gate with his hat on than did this ‘committee in conference’ on seeing us take the position we did. Garrison was besought to come down. They tried every means in their power to seduce him down. Every time he was mentioned that whole conference would applaud as if they thought they could clap him down. … But they might as well have expected to remove the pillars upon which the gallery stood.” It was, indeed, a singular world’s convention from which the leader of the greatest antislavery movement of the age had to abstain from taking part in order to vindicate the principle of human equality. By so doing he called attention in a remarkable way to the disabilities under which women labored even when devoting themselves to so noble a cause as that of the abolition of slavery—and the convention marks an important era in the woman question rather than that of abolition.\nIt will ever be instructive and interesting to dwell upon the steady progress of the woman’s cause, in spite of deep-seated prejudice, ridicule and ostracism. Democracy itself is but a name where women have no part in it. Can it be that it is expedient to shut out from its benefits any part of the human race? Most assuredly not. Negro women need the franchise, all foreign women need it, and no one of us can afford to be deprived of it any more than men. What more forcibly points the moral of the imperative necessity of the franchise for each and every human being than the heartbreaking conditions existing to-day in the South among the oppressed colored people? Largely deprived, as they are, of the franchise in the South, who cares for their rights? In truth, they can only be safeguarded when the ballot is theirs; without helpless.\nIn conclusion, let me again quote my father’s words: “The people may err—they often do; they may be badly deceived—they often are; but the people as such are never wilfully deceived, nor are they hostile to their own interests. They may be deceived, but they will by and by understand the deceptions and deal with the deceivers; but you cannot possibly have a broader basis for any government than that which includes all the people, with all their rights in their hands, and with an equal power to maintain their rights.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTwo Suffrage Movements (1912)\nThe Risk of Woman Suffrage (1915)\nThe Justice of Woman Suffrage (1912)\nWoman’s Suffrage (1913)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nVillard, Fanny, Garrison. 1912. “Garrison and Woman’s\nSuffrage.” The Crisis 4 (5): 240–42. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/05/garrison_and_womans_suffrage.html."

    "text": "More and mocre colored women are studying public questions and civics. As they gain information and have experience in their daily vocations and in their efforts for human betterment they are convinced, as many other women have long ago been convinced, that their efforts would be more telling if women had the vote.\nThe fashion of saying “I do not care to meddle with politics” is disappearing among the colored woman faster than most people think, for this same woman has learned that politics meddle constantly with her and hers.\nGood women try always to do good house-keeping. Building inspectors, sanitary inspectors and food inspectors owe their positions to politics. Who then is so well informed as to how these inspectors perform their duties as the women who live in inspected districts and in inspected houses, and who buy food from inspected markets?\nAdequate school facilities in city, village and plantation districts greatly concern the black mother. But without a vote she has no voice in educational legislation, and no power to see that her children secure their share of public-school funds.\nNegro parents admit that their own children are not all angels, but they know that the environments which they are helpless to regulate increase misdemeanor and crime. They know, too, that officers, as a rule, recognize few obligations to voteless citizens.\nWhen colored juvenile delinquents are arraigned, few judges or juries feel bound to give them the clemency due a neglected class. When sentence is pronounced on mischievous youngsters, too often imprisoned with adult criminals and come out hardened and not helped by their punishment. When colored mothers ask for a reform school for a long time they receive no answer. They must wait while they besiege their legislature. Having no vote they need not be feared or heeded. The “right of petition” is good; but it is much better when well voted in.\nNot only is the colored woman awake to reforms that may be hastened by good legislation and wise administration, but where she has the ballot she is reported as using it for the uplift of society and for the advancement of the State.\nIn California the colored woman bore her part creditably in the campaign for equal suffrage and also with commendable patriotism in the recent presidential nomination campaign.\nThe State of Washington, new with its votes-for-women law, has already had a colored woman juror. Why not? She is educated and wealthy and wants to protect the best interests in her State.\nColorado has never had better school officials than her women have made. Judge Ben. Lindsey is as popular with colored women voters as he is with white women voters. The juvenile court over which he presides gives the boy a square deal regardless of color. A majority of mothers and fathers can be counted on every time to support such an official.\nWyoming, Utah and Idaho, the other full suffrage States, have few colored women, but these few are not hurt by, but are being helped by, their voting privileges.\nIn the States that are now conducting woman suffrage campaigns the colored woman is as interested and probably as active as conditions warrant. This is notably true of Ohio and Kansas.\nA number of colored women are active members of the National Woman Suffrage Association. They are well informed and are diligent in the spread of propaganda. Women who see that they need the vote see also that the vote needs them. Colored women feel keenly that they may help in civic betterment, and that their broadened interests in matters of good government may arouse the colored brother, who for various reasons has become too indifferent to his duties of citizenship.\nThe suffrage map shows that six States have equal political rights for women and men, and that a much larger number have granted partial suffrage to women. In all these the colored woman is taking part, not as fully as she will when the question is less of an experiment, not as heartily as she will when her horizon broadens, but she bears her part.\nThis much, however, is true now: the colored American believes in equal justice to all, regardless of race, color, creed or sex, and longs for the day when the United States shall indeed have a government of the people, for the people and by the people—even including the colored people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVotes for Women (1912)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nWoman’s Suffrage (1913)\nThe Risk of Woman Suffrage (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAella Hunt, Logan. 1912. “Colored Women as Voters.”\nThe Crisis 4 (5): 242–43. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/05/colored_women_as_voters.html."

    "text": "We are glad that at last there can be no doubt in any colored man’s mind concerning the attitude of Theodore Roosevelt toward his race. There were many of us who were disposed, after time had dimmed the bitter memory, to attribute the unjust dismissal of hundreds of colored soldiers who were not even charged with wrongdoing, because of the suspected but far from proven guilt of a few—there were some of us who wished to attribute this official Brownsville “lynching” to the mistaken but sincere impulse of a strong personality rather than to meaner motive.\nSince then, however, Theodore Roosevelt has been put to a greater test. To explain the action of his progressive convention one must realize Mr. Roosevelt’s attitude toward black men. He does not respect them. It is doubtful if ever in his life he has really known a colored man whom he thought was wholly a man. The colored men with whom he has come in contact have executed his orders, have taken his commands and his money, but his association with them has been essentially that of master and servant, not of man and man. Even when he has defended colored men his motive may have been stubborn determination to have his own way rather than a desire for real justice.\nFor this reason Mr. Roosevelt has been unreasonably irritated against Negroes several times. It would be impossible for him to explain his own feeling or altogether account for it. It has in it a certain Southern flavor and is perhaps something like what one would feel if one’s cat should insist on argument and rights instead of purring obedience. How else can we explain Mr. Roosevelt’s irritation at the black soldiers who saved his regiment in Cuba? His violence at Brownsville? His evident deep resentment at the action of the colored delegates at Chicago? With thousands of his white fellow Americans Mr. Roosevelt shares that half-conscious contempt for black men which arises because of an almost absolute lack of contact between the races on planes of equality and mutual respect.\nStarting then with this there can be little doubt but that the mission of Ormsby McHarg to the South was based on the assumption that the buying up of Negro delegates was simply a matter of money. The sixty-six colored delegates in the Republican convention held the balance of power; if the bulk of them had been purchasable they could have sold their votes for large sums of money, and there is little doubt but that Mr. Roosevelt’s agents offered them large sums.\nThere was, too, historic reason for Mr. Roosevelt’s assumption: There has always been a disgracefully large purchasable element among the black delegates from the South. It has been a shame, but a shame the cause of which is perfectly plain, and for which the Negro race could not in justice be blamed.\nMoreover, it happened that precisely that reform for which Mr. Roosevelt and others had sometimes but not always asked was gradually coming; never before had a Southern Negro delegation to the Republican convention contained so large a proportion of self-respecting men who could not be bribed. This fact Mr. Roosevelt and his agents discovered, but the discovery seems again to have irritated rather than pleased; just as in Reconstruction times, the one thing that the white South seems to have feared more that bad Negro rule was good Negro rule, and it was the reform governments of South Carolina and Mississippi that led to the overthrow of Negro rule just at the moment when reform seemed about to succeed.\nSo here is repetition of history: the sixty-six Negro delegates had many politicians and “grafters,” but it had also merchants, lawyers and physicians, honest, straightforward, unpurchasable men, a body of encouraging promise for better things. Not only that, but in the new Progressive party sat several black delegates of high calibre, quite fit, we are told by Mr. Roosevelt himself, to stand beside their white fellows.\nIt was such men, who for themselves and as solemn trustees for the rights and hopes of 10,000,000 human beings—10,000,000 men, women and children who have been wronged as few modern peoples have been wronged—asked the adoption of this plank by the New Crusaders:\n\nThe Progressive party recognizes that distinctions of race or class in political life have no place in a democracy. Especially does the party realize that a group of 10,000,000 people who have in a generation changed from a slave to a free labor system, re-established family life, accumulated $1,000,000,000 of real property, including 20,000,000 acres of land, and reduced their illiteracy from 80 to 30 per cent., deserve and must have justice, opportunity and a voice in their own government. The party, therefore, dgmands for the American of Negro descent the repeal of unfair discriminatory laws and the right to vote on the same terms on which other citizens vote.\n\nThis is the exact wording of the original plank which was written in The Crisis office.\nSuch was the meagre declaration that black men asked. They did not get this. Not only was this refused, but every suggested modification, refinement and watering down was rejected, and the platform of the new Progressive party of human rights appears absolutely silent on the greatest question of human rights that ever faced America!\nFurthermore, lest there should be any misinterpretation of this silence, the party proceeded to bar practically every representative of 8,000,000 Southern Negroes and to recognize delegates chosen by Southern conventions open “to white people only.” To seal this compact these Hosts at Armageddon stood and sang:\n\nMine eyes have seen the glory\n \nof the coming of the Lord!\n\nSelah!\nNow, Mr. Black Voter—you with 600,000 ballots in your hand, you with the electoral vote of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and New York in your pocket— WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Election (1912)\nMr. Taft (1911)\nPresidential Candidates (1920)\nThe President (1915)\nAllies (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Mr. Roosevelt.” The Crisis\n4 (5): 235–36. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/05/mr_roosevelt.html."

    "text": "It is difficult to believe that any individual in the United States with one drop of African blood in his veins can oppose woman suffrage. It is queer and curious enough to hear an intelligent colored woman argue against granting suffrage to her sex, but for an intelligent colored man to oppose woman suffrage is the most preposterous and ridiculous thing in the world. What could be more absurd than to see one group of human beings who are denied rights which they are trying to secure for themselves working to prevent another group from obtaining the same rights? For the very arguments which are advanced against granting the right of suffrage to women are offered by those who have disfranchised colored men.\nIf I were a colored man, and were unfortunate enough not to grasp the absurdity of opposing suffrage because of the sex of a human being, I should at least be consistent enough never to raise my voice against those who have disfranchised my brothers and myself on account of race. However, the intelligent colored man who opposes woman suffrage is very rare, indeed. While on a lecture tour recently I frequently discussed woman suffrage with the leading citizens in the communities in which I spoke. It was very gratifying, indeed, to see that in the majority of instances these men stood right on the question of woman suffrage.\nFrederick Douglass did many things of which I am proud, but there is nothing he ever did in his long and brilliant career in which I take keener pleasure and greater pride than I do in his ardent advocacy of equal political rights for women, and the effective service he rendered the cause of woman suffrage sixty years ago. When the resolution demanding equal political rights for women was introduced in the meeting held at Seneca Falls, N. Y., in 1848, Frederick Douglass was the only man in the convention courageous and broad minded enough to second the motion. It was largely due to Douglass’s masterful arguments and matchless eloquence that the motion was carried, in spite of the opposition of its very distinguished and powerful foes. In his autobiography Douglass says: “Observing woman’s agency, devotion and efficiency, gratitude for this high service early moved me to give favorable attention to the subject of what is called ‘woman’s rights’ and caused me to be denominated a woman’s rights man. I am glad to say,” he adds, “that I have never been ashamed to be thus designated. I have been convinced of the wisdom of woman suffrage and I have never denied the faith.”\nTo assign reasons in this day and time to prove that it is unjust to withhold from one-half of the human race rights and privileges freely accorded the other half, which is neither more deserving nor more capable of exercising them, seems almost like a reflection upon the intelligence of those to whom they are presented. To argue the inalienability and the equality of human rights in the twentieth century in a country whose government was founded upon the eternal principles that all men are created free and equal, that governments get their just powers from the consent of the governed, seems like laying one’s self open to the charge of anachronism. For 2,000 years mankind has been breaking down the various barriers which interposed themselves between human beings and their perfect freedom to exercise all the faculties with which they have been divinely endowed. Even in monarchies old fetters, which formerly restricted freedom, dwarfed the intellect and doomed certain individuals to narrow, circumscribed spheres because of the mere accident of birth, are being loosed and broken one by one.\nWhat a reproach it is to a government which owes its very existence to the loved freedom in the human heart that it should deprive any of its citizens of their sacred and cherished rights. The founders of this republic called heaven and earth to witness that it should be called a government of the people, for the people and by the people; and yet the elective franchise is withheld from one-half of its citizens, many of whom are intelligent, virtuous and cultured, and unstintingly bestowed upon the other half, many of whom are illiterate, degraded and vicious, because by an unparalleled exhibition of lexicographical acrobatics the word “people” has been turned and twisted to mean all who were shrewd and wise enough to have themselves born boys instead of girls, and white instead of black.\nBut why grant women the suffrage when the majority do not want it, the remonstrants sometimes ask with innocent engaging seriousness. Simply because there are many people, men as well as women, who are so constructed as to be unable to ascertain by any process of reason what is the best thing for them to have or to do. Until the path is blazed by the pioneer, even some people who have superior intellects and moral courage dare not forge ahead. On the same principle and for just exactly the same reason that American women would reject suffrage, Chinese women, if they dared to express any opinion at all, would object to having the feet of their baby girls removed from the bandages which stunt their growth. East Indian women would scorn the proferred freedom of their American sisters as unnatural and vulgar and would die rather than have their harems abolished. Slaves sometimes prefer to bear the ills of bondage rather than accept the blessings of freedom, because their poor beclouded brains have been stunted and dwarfed by oppression so long that they cannot comprehend what liberty means and have no desire to enjoy it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVotes for Women (1912)\nThe Risk of Woman Suffrage (1915)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nWoman’s Suffrage (1913)\nTwo Suffrage Movements (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMary Church, Terrell. 1912. “The Justice of Woman\nSuffrage.” The Crisis 4 (5): 243–45. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/05/justice_of_woman_suffrage.html."

    "text": "The colored voter now stands face to face with the great question of the proper use of his electoral franchise. Under normal conditions 2,000,000 of the 20,000,000 votes which might be cast at a presidential election would belong to the race, and some day, despite every effort of fraud and race prejudice, those votes are going to be cast.\nTo-day, however, of the 15,000,000 or more votes which will actually be cast for President, some 500,000 will be black men’s votes.\nWhat shall we do with these 500,000 ballots?\nFirst of all we must teach ourselves to regard them seriously. The Negro-American is not disfranchised; on the contrary, he is a half million votes this side of disfranchisement and that is a long, long way. There have been but two or three presidential elections since the war which have not been settled by a margin of less than a half million votes, and in every single election since the proslavery compromise of 1850 such a number of votes distributed at strategic points would easily have decided the presidency.\nThe votes of black Americans are today at strategic points. We may, of course, leave the South out of account: on account of illegal enactments and brazen fraud, democratic government exists in the South only in inchoate and incomplete form. The presidential election is probably going to be decided by the Middle West and the States of New York and New Jersey. New York and\nOhio have each between 40,000 and 50,000 colored votes; New Jersey, Illinois and Indiana have each 30,000 or more. Is there any political prophet who would risk his reputation on the possibility of any one of these States being carried by more than 20,000 majority? There may be majorities of 50,000 or 100,000 in one or two of the States, but the chances are that the colored voters hold the balance of power in every one of their States and thus have the power to say whether William Howard Taft or Woodrow Wilson shall be the next President.\nIf colored America had long political experience and wide knowledge of men and measures, it would organize the black voters of each State into a solid phalanx. It would say to this phalanx: white and colored voters in this land are selling their votes too cheaply. By the use of a “slush fund” of $3,000,000 Theodore Roosevelt was able almost to split the Republican party. You could easily sell your votes next November for one or two millions of dollars, but that is too cheap. You could easily sell your votes for an Assistant Attorney General, a Register of the Treasury, a Recorder of Deeds and a few other black wooden men whose duty it is to look pleasant, say nothing and have no opinions that a white man is bound to respect. This also is too cheap—it is dirt cheap.\nWhat price should you ask for 500,000 votes, black America? You should ask this:\n\nThe abolition of the interstate “Jim Crow” car.  \nThe enforcement of the Thirteenth Amendment by the suppression of peonage.\nThe enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment by cutting down the representation in Congress of the rotten boroughs of the South.\n\nNational aid to elementary public schools without class or racial discrimination.\n\nIs this price too much to pay for a presidency? It is not if you dare ask it.\nWho then would pay it? Would William Howard Taft pay it? There has not been in the presidential chair for fifty years a man so utterly lacking in initiative and ideal as Mr. Taft. His abject surrender to Southern prejudice and reaction has been simply pitiable: He began his career by defending disfranchisement; he followed this by promising to appoint no black man to office if any white man protested; and in spite of the fact that over 200 Negroes have been publicly murdered without trial during his administration, the utmost that 10,000,000 black men have elicited from his lips is a hesitating statement that he is sorry—and helpless. Any colored man who votes for Mr. Taft will do so on the assumption that zero is better than minus one.\nAs to Mr. Wilson, there are, one must confess, disquieting facts: he was born in Virginia and he was long president of a college which did not admit Negro students and yet was not honest enough to say so, resorting rather to subterfuge and evasion. A man, however, is not wholly responsible for his birthplace or his college. On the whole, we do not believe that Woodrow Wilson admires Negroes. Left to himself, we suspect he would be like Mr. Johnson, the new dean of Yale. Mr. Johnson is a Southerner, and recently told a colored applicant that Yale did not want “Chinese, Jews or Negroes.” The ideal of such folk would be a world inhabited by flaxen-haired wax dolls with or without brains.\nNotwithstanding such possible preferences, Woodrow Wilson is a cultivated scholar and he has brains. We know that there are several hundred millions of “Chinese, Jews and Negroes” who have to be reckoned with, and that the date at which the “blond beast” will inherit this earth has been, to put it mildly, indefinitely postponed. We have, therefore, a conviction that Mr. Wilson will treat black men and their interests with farsighted fairness. He will not be our friend, but he will not belong to the gang of which Tillman, Vardaman, Hoke Smith and Blease are the brilliant expositors. He will not advance the cause of oligarchy in the South, he will not seek further means of “Jim Crow” insult, he will not dismiss black men wholesale from office, and he will remember that the Negro in the United States has a right to be heard and considered; and if he becomes President by the grace of the black man’s vote, his Democratic successors may be more willing to pay the black man’s price of decent travel, free labor, votes and education.\nOutside of these two men, what else? We thank God that Theodore Roosevelt has been eliminated. How many black men, with the memory of Brownsville, could support such a man passes our comprehension. Of Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist candidate, we can only say this frankly: if it lay in our power to make him President of the United States we would do so, for of the four men mentioned he alone, by word and deed, stands squarely on a platform of human rights regardless of race or class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVotes (1919)\nThe Colored Voter (1919)\nPolitical Straws (1923)\nThe Negro Voter (1928)\nVoting (1910)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Politics.” The Crisis 4\n(4): 180–81. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/04/politics.html."

    "text": "The Crisis believes in organized labor. It realizes that the standard of living among’ workers has been raised in the last half century through the efforts and sacrifice of laborers banded together in unions, and that all American labor to-day, white, black and yellow, benefits from this great movement.\nFor such reasons we carry on our front cover the printer’s union label to signify that the printing and binding of this magazine is done under conditions and with wages satisfactory to the printers’ union.\nWe do this in spite of the fact, as well known to us as to others, that the “conditions satisfactory” to labor men in this city include the deliberate exclusion from decent-paying jobs of every black man whom white workingmen can exclude on any pretense. We know, and all men know, that under ordinary circumstances no black artisan can to-day work as printer, baker, blacksmith, carpenter, hatter, butcher, tailor, street or railway employee, boilermaker, bookbinder, electrical worker, glass blower, machinist, plumber, telegrapher, electrotyper, textile worker, upholsterer, stone cutter, carriage maker, plasterer, mason, painter—or at any other decent trade unless he works as a “scab,” or unless in some locality he has secured such a foothold that the white union men are not able easily to oust him.\nThis policy is not always avowed (although there are a dozen unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor who openly confine admission to “white” men), but it is perfectly well understood. Some unions, like the printers and the carpenters, admit a lone colored man here and there so as to enable them the more easily to turn down the rest. Others, like the masons, admit Negroes in the South where they must, and bar them in the North where they can.\nWhatever the tactics, the result is the same for the mass of white workingmen in America; beat or starve the Negro out of his job if you can by keeping him out of the union; or, if you must admit him, do the same thing inside union lines.\nWhat then must be the attitude of the black man in the event of a strike like that of the white waiters of New York? The mass of them must most naturally regard the union white man as their enemy. They may not know the history of the labor movement, but they know the history of white and black waiters in New York, and when they take back the jobs out of which the white waiters have driven them, they do the natural and sensible thing, howsoever pitiable the necessity of such cutthroat policies in the labor world may be. So long as union labor fights for humanity, its mission is divine; but when it fights for a clique of Americans, Irish or German monopolists who have cornered or are trying to corner the market on a certain type of service, and are seeking to sell that service at a premium, while other competent workmen starve, they deserve themselves the starvation which they plan for their darker and poorer fellows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nThe Negro and Labor (1922)\nThe A.F. of L.

    "text": "As the colored people become more and more a self-conscious, selfdirecting group, with organs of intelligence and moving representatives, it is becoming difficult to deceive them as to men and movements. On the other hand, there is still opportunity for unscrupulous colored men to play on the ignorance of the white world as to what is going on in the colored group. If a man announces himself to be of a certain position in the white world, he is immediately looked up carefully. But the colored impostor is taken on blind faith and his lies and peculations when discovered are credited to the whole black race. In Atlanta there is a colored preacher who is making a living and some notoriety by vilifying his people; he has been repudiated by his own church and school, but has an institution of his own which he is promoting. His latest bid for white Southern support is this:\n\nOur training in the college, university and grammar school has been t,oo much of the theoretical, showy kind, more for name than reality. How many of our boys and girls, who are said to be well educated, are almost helpless for the reason that they can do nothing that really pays or that somebody wants done. This is illustrated by the large army to be seen at our depots, pool-rooms and street corners in the red-light districts of the communities and cities where we are so largely congested.\n\nThis is a contemptible lie. The graduates of Southern Negro schools and colleges are not loafing in the “red-light” districts and this man knows it. But what difference does that make so long as the white world of Atlanta praises him, uses his words to traduce and cripple worthy colored schools, and gives him letters with which to raise money from gullible Northerners for an institution that exists chiefly on paper?\nAnother method of deception has been discovered in promoting conventions. There is a National Association of Teachers in colored schools, which is now nine years old. Seeing its success, some colored men in Kansas City have been promoting in the last two years a “Negro National Educational Congress.” They have advertised widely, induced governors to appoint “delegates” and sought to make it appear that they had the support of some body of worthy teachers.\nIn fact they are nothing but a private set of promoters, many of whom are said to be of doubtful reputation, and not one of them of any considerable standing in the colored educational world. Their “convention” at Denver last year barely missed being a fiasco, and we trust that the worthy colored citizens of St. Paul will see to it that this “convention” does not parade in that city under false colors, and bring ten million people into contempt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOptimism (1929)\nOptimism (1927)\nConduct, Not Color (1916)\nThe White Church (1917)\nThe Strength of Segregation (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Fraud and Imitation.”\nThe Crisis 4 (3): 130–31. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/03/fraud_and_imitation.html."

    "text": "During slavery days the house servants were rewarded with extra privileges, among which were the left-over food and cast-off clothing of the “big house.” This easily became, under the less rigorous forms of serfdom, a sort of payment in kind for personal service, and now and then “tips” in actual money were given. When formal emancipation came the servants were promised wages, but as a matter of fact the wages were seldom paid in cash, while a money value was often given to the food and old clothes. This old custom could easily degenerate into something very like stealing, and yet the custom could seem justifiable in the eyes of the ignorant, especially when their wages were low and often unpaid, and when they saw mistresses wink at and even expect peculations of this sort. On the other hand, colored servants are not dishonest; money, jewelry and the like are safe in their hands with few exceptions.\nThe result of the old system was unrest among servants, and the more intelligent and thrifty escaped from domestic service into the care of their own homes or day’s work or other industrial avenues. Or if they continued in service they went North, where instead of receiving $1.50 a week in old clothes and cold victuals, they could earn $5 and $6 a week in cash.\nMoreover, the conditions under which a colored servant in the South must work are the worst in the civilized world. The hours are endless, the quarters are poor, the deference demanded is unbearable to people of the least spirit, and the assumption of the natural inferiority of the servant is almost universal.\nNot only this but there is in the majority of cases in the South absolutely no protection for the black girl’s virtue in the white man’s home. Everybody knows that the mulatto both before and since slavery was the outcome of house service.\nWhat is the result? Poor and un­willing service. The best Negroes are withdrawing their sons and daughters from house service just as quickly as they can, and they deserve commendation for so doing. Even those Negroes who publicly commend house service are curiously careful to keep their children out of it. Those who cannot escape are demanding shorter hours, proper wages and better treatment. And those Southern families who can keep their black servants but three weeks would better ask advice of their neighbors who keep good and faithful black servants for ten and twenty years.\nInstead of responding to a legiti­mate demand for change in working conditions, the majority of South­erners take their usual refuge in whining and shrieking “Negro” problem. Every time that the white South runs head foremost into the inevitable laws of nature by trying to keep slavery, establish peonage, deny manhood rights to men and de­grade decent women—every time the South tries this there is a mawkish sentimentality throughout the North to encourage the idea that these laws are not human but peculiar or racial.\nIf people pay their laborers low wages and cheat them out of even these, they will get cheap labor, whether that labor be black, white or blue.\nIf the South or the North wants de­cent domestic service it must\n\nPay decent wages.\nGive shorter hours and more definite duties.\nTreat servants as men and women and not as cattle.\n\nThe people that are unwilling to do this will find the “servant problem” always with them, even though they nickname it a “Negro” problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nExcept Servants (1911)\nSlavery (1922)\nLoyalty (1917)\nSuffrage (1920)\nThe Negro and Labor (1922)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “The Servant in the South.”\nThe Crisis 3 (6): 200–201. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/06/servant_in_the_south.html."

    "text": "It will be interesting to hear the American chorus when the population figures of the census of 1910 are published. They will show naturally a large increase of whites ard a small increase of colored people. Then we will have a long howl of glee from the Negro baiters, a sigh of delicious content from the North and a puzzled silence from black folk. And why?\nThe South will say:\n\nThe decreased rate of increase of Negroes during the last decade was lower than ever before. It grows progressively lower. Therefore the Negro is dying out.\n\nThe North will say:\n\nIt is providential—the physique of inferior races, etc., etc.\n\nYet what are the facts? They are as plain as day:\nThe Negro population is increasing as fast as any normal modern folk. The increase of the whites in the United States is not normal. Their birth rate in every normal white country is decreasing far more rapidly than that of the Negro. The white American situation is abnormal through an immense immigration. Even the so-called “native whites of native parents” are largely those whose grandparents migrated and those who forgot about the nativity of their parents. The mass of Southern native whites show all the marks of carelessness due to sudden economic affluence. From an economic position below slaves they have in a single generation been raised almost to the modern wage level. The result is big families.\nNow, to compare this temporary abnormal increase of whites in America with the more normal increase of colored people is silly. The facts concerning colored folk are well known:\nThey have practically no immigration.\nThey are under severe economic repression.\nThey are under a mental and moral strain such as no group outside the Jews and Finns in Russia are to-day suffering.\nDespite this they are increasing as fast as the English, nearly as fast as the Germans and far faster than the French. They are without reasonable doubt increasing much faster than the original New England stock or the Quaker stock or any of the earlier settlers of America.\nWith this large increase is going an economic betterment which is astounding when we remember the handicap, and is clearly shown in the agricultural and property statistics. And, finally, when all is said, remember that to-day there are ONE MILLION more colored people in America than there were in 1900.\nRemember that, allowing for every probable decrease in birth rate in the future, Americans will live to see 15,000,000 of colored people by 1950, and if the present tendencies persist these millions, because of their wealth and intelligence, will be less easily insulted, less easily scared into silence, less easily imposed upon by their own demagogues and, as Mr. Dooley has it, less “aisily lynched.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Rate of Increase (1933)\nDeath Rates (1927)\nCrime (1926)\nEducation (1915)\nOur Health (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “The Census.” The Crisis 3\n(1): 24. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/01/census.html."

    "text": "The November elections come as a sort of Christmas gift to black folk. First, the Digges amendment to disfranchise colored people has been defeated in Maryland by a decisive majority of 20,551 votes. This is the third time that the Democratic machine has attempted to get rid of the colored vote. Secondly, the Democratic Legislature that neglected to amend and reconsider the colored regiment bill in New York has been sent home; but Cuvillier, the Democrat who introduced the bill, has been retained in his seat by the black voters of Harlem. It may easily be granted that Cuvillier is no ideal statesman, but is it not significant that he was the only man in this or former legislatures willing to do his colored constituents’ demand? May we not respectfully assure Governor Dix that he himself will need the black vote soon and that this vote “follows the regiment?” Third, the Socialists, the only party which openly recognizes Negro manhood, has been signally triumphant. Is it not time for black voters to carefully consider the claims of this party? Fourth, we call the attention of contented lovers of democratic government in this land to the fact that while 400,000 votes were cast for governor in the little State of Massachusetts, it took only 40,000 votes to elect the governor of Mississippi, the pioneer State of disfranchisement. How long will democracy stand in America with one white man in Mississippi casting the equivalent of ten votes?\nFinally, there is every indication that the election of 1912 will be a close election. If Mr. Taft succeeds himself after his tariff record, his silence on lynching and his treatment of colored officials, it will be by a margin that will call for every black vote in the North. Will he get these votes? Maybe—perhaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Election (1910)\nEducation (1913)\nThe Republicans (1915)\nThe Colored Voter (1919)\nThe Negro Party (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Christmas Gift.” The Crisis\n3 (2): 68. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/02/christmas_gift.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A favorite argument in the South is that the white people “pay for” the education of colored children. For instance, an alderman in Lexington, Ky., argues this way, in answer to a complaint about poor colored schools:\nThe Negroes of Lexington hold $774,735 worth of property, on which the school tax is $4,415.99. The white people pay taxes on $22,000,000, on which the school tax is $77,000. The colored schools cost $24,971.35. “These,” concludes the Richmond Times-Despatch, “are very striking figures and dispose of the complaint made by the Negro leaders.”\nLet us see. In the first place the alderman gracefully includes in the “white” property all the property of corporations and public-service companies, because their stockholders are mostly white. In addition to this, it credits to the white taxpayer all property rented to colored tenants. But who pays the taxes on rented property? To settle this point let us turn to the criticism of the New York City Budget Exhibit made by the Committee on Congestion of Population.\n\nThe budget exhibit fails to show the fact that the assessed value of tenements and buildings used for dwelling purposes in New York is about $1,250,000,000, and that the taxes on these buildings, at the average tax rate of $1.75, amount to $21,875,000 this year. New York is the great ‘tenant’ city.\n  Nor is the fact shown that these taxes on buildings are paid by the tenants, and that a good tenement apartment unit of four rooms is worth at least $1,250, and that taxes on this at a rate of $1.75 per $100, full value, amount to $21.87, or more than a month’s rent. Approximately this amount is paid in taxes by the poorest of the poor, the sick and consumptives, and those families trying to exist on from $100 to $300 less than the recognized standard of living.\n\nWhat is true in New York is mere than true in Lexington, Ky. Indeed, throughout the South, in most cities outside of Texas, the Negro in direct and indirect taxation is not only paying for his own wretched schooling accommodations, but is also contributing to the schools of the rich whites and then double-taxing himself by contributions to decent colored private schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEducation (1930)\nNegro Education (1918)\nTaxation without Representation (1914)\nEducation (1911)\nReconstruction (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “The Cost of Education.”\nThe Crisis 3 (2): 69. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/02/cost_of_education.html."

    "text": "“He doesn’t really believe what he says—he wants the same things that you want, but you see he has to talk this way.”\n“Tillman? Oh, Tillman is a good friend of Negroes—his anti-Negro talk is just for political effect.” And so forth. The young man then sits back and eyes us pleasantly. He considers that what he says is explanation and excuse. Is it not perfectly clear that men are often “in a position” where they must say what they do not for a moment believe? Well, does not this fact explain and excuse their actions and utterances?\nIt does not. Such action is the one unforgiven and unforgivable sin. It is the sin against the Holy Ghost for which neither the world nor the makers of the world ever forgive a human soul, and (what is far more important) for which in the end a man never forgives himself.\nWhat is this strange, lightly tossed doctrine which young black men and young white men are to-day so easily handling? Done into plain English it is this: Whenever a man considers that it is to his advantage to deceive the public he is at liberty to do so. Whenever a lie serves a gentleman’s purpose better than the truth, he may lie. And if at any time thereafter he is accused of deception or charged with lying it is a good and sufficient answer for him to allege that his interests required a falsehood, or his position in the world demanded deception, or that his bread and butter called for a lie.\nThis is a counsel of destruction. It is a doctrine of death. It will, if persisted in, damn any individual and it will utterly destroy any race. The individual may escape visible punishment, for life is short. But the immortal race cannot escape.\nThe Negro race in America is today being offered every inducement to lie and deceive. It is asked to lie about its desires and ambitions. It is asked to lie about its own human feelings. It is asked to give lying testimony as to the goodness of its neighbors. If it will consent to lie, there are money, position and applause for the chief liars and winks and promises for the fools that follow. Yet the end is death. The end is first bewilderment among honest people. My God! they say, if a people who have had twenty-five hundred of their fellows lynched without trial in twenty-five years; who have seen nine-tenths of their voters disfranchised; who cannot travel, sit or walk without danger of public insult—if such a people do not believe in “complaint” or “agitation” and merely are ambitious to be “useful” to their neighbors, why should we strive to help them? No sooner have they reached this conclusion than some obsequious colored gentleman explains in lowered tones: “We are not really satisfied, we are just lying to appease our enemies and keep our jobs.” What is the result? Contempt and suspicion. Contempt for a people who place their jobs above their souls, and well-grounded suspicion that the man who will lie under such circumstances will lie under others.\nThus the result of the sin against the Holy Ghost is suspicion and contempt from others and lack of faith in one’s self. What black man in America to-day who is preaching contentment to ten million slaves does not in his heart despise himself for doing it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nDarrow (1928)\nThe Truth (1912)\nA Statement (1919)\nTillman (1918)\nHeroes (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “The Sin Against the Holy Ghost.”\nThe Crisis 3 (2): 68–69. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/02/sin.html."

This departure is not due to race prejudice or hatred for the Negro but for the protection of the neighborhood values against designing or ugly white men.\n\nNot a word for the colored family seeking a decent home; but if that family live in the slums and purlieus and let the surroundings teach their children crime and prostitution, then the holy horror of the Times and its ilk!

    "text": "When the trustees of the Phelps-Stokes fund gave two Southern universities $12,500 each to endow a fellowship for the study of the Negro they did well. For many decades there has been a venerable tradition that the South “knows” the Negro better than others. Gradually, however, it is dawning even on the white South that there is nothing in mere physical distance half so separating as the artificial social, economic and racial barriers erected in the South since the war, and that the ignorance of the white South as to the life, hurts and dreams of the darker half of their world is, in some respects, both phenomenal and disgraceful. Take, for instance, this letter from a Southern woman who has read The Crisis:\n\nThe Negro is a child, incompetent to right his own wrongs, but wonderfully susceptible to inspirational teaching. As a race he has a childlike conceit and thoroughly enjoys being ‘in the limelight.’ He has the untutored’s love of the morbid, revels in the sensational, and under praise wisely ad­ministered gives forth his best efforts. Some of the crime committed by the Negro is undoubtedly due to the de­sire to attract public attention. ‘If fame cannot be won, infamy can,’ is the subconscious conclusion of some Negro criminals—as it is with some white criminals. It seems to me that the best and most practical philan­thropy that can be performed for the race is to cease discussing him as a problem and consider him as child whose future career is to be shaped and molded by wise disciplin­ary educational methods.\n\nConsider for a moment this extraordinary judgment: “The Negro” and “A Child!” Ten million people tossed nonchalantly into one mold with one estimate, one final and eternal judg­ment. One could not find ten million dogs, much less ten million men, whom one definition would fit.\nThe difficulty is, of course, that this honest woman knows and can know but one or few types of Negro. Her observation is confined to her kitchen, the almshouse and the chances of the street. Of the black man as a man, of the black woman as a woman, she has almost no experience, and by grace of the color line can have no experience. Her ignorance is all the greater because it is not known to be ignorance, but parades as deep and subtle knowl­edge. The world-old phenomenon of the childishness, laziness and crimi­nality of the ignorant and oppressed becomes in her blindness purely a racial, a “Negro” trait. If the gift to the University of Virginia will do something to shake the appalling con­fidence of such wild judgments the money will be well spent.\nOf course, the scientific result will be small. For many years these young students will record not the observed facts, but their preconceived prejudices. This is inevitable with persons who start despising and not revering human souls simply because of their humanity. Gradually, however, truth will triumph. Gradually it will not be possible to assert unchallenged in the University of Geor­gia that “niggers are lazy.” It will be explained by some perverse per­son that this laziness has somehow accumulated a thousand millions in fifty years—although, of course, those who did this are “exceptions.” In time this center of learning will cease to talk of “the” Negro and begin to talk of men—some rich, some poor; some good, some bad; some undeveloped “children” and some children of the Kingdom of God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Newer South (1926)\nThe Unfortunate South (1920)\nEducation (1911)\nSeparation (1911)\nSocial Equality (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Light.” The Crisis 3 (4):\n152–53. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/04/light.html."

    "text": "Many people object to the policy of The Crisis because, as they usually put it, The Crisis is “bitter.” Some add that our news is depressing or that we are determined to look on the dark side, and so forth.\nIt may be acknowledged at the outset that The Crisis does not try to be funny. Not that we object to fun: our office is a cheerful place, with bits of sunshine and eager young lives and high joyful purpose. But our stock in trade is not jokes. We are in earnest. This is a newspaper. It tries to tell the Truth. It will not consciously exaggerate in any way, but its whole reason for being is the revelation of the facts of racial antagonism now in the world, and these facts are not humorous.\nTrue it is that this country has had its appetite for facts on the Negro problem spoiled by sweets. In earlier days the Negro minstrel who “jumped Jim Crow” was the typical black man served up to the national taste. It was the balmy day when slaves were “happy” and “preferred” slavery to all other possible states. Then came the sobering of abolition days and war, when for one horrified moment the world gazed on the hell of slavery and knew it for what it was.\nIn the last fifteen years there has come another campaign of Joy and Laughter to degrade black folk. We have been told that all was well or if aught was wrong the wrong was with the colored man. We have had audiences entertained with “nigger” stories, tales of pianos in cabins, and of the general shiftlessness of the freedman, and concerted effort to make it appear that the wrongs of color prejudice are but incidental and trivial, while the shortcomings of black men are stupendous, if not fatal.\nThis is the lie which The Crisis is here to refute. It is a lie, a miserable and shameful lie, which some black men have helped the white South to spread and been well paid for their pains.\nIt is not easy to impress the real truth after this debauch of defamation, but we must try. In so trying we realize that the mere statement of the facts does not always carry its message. Often the lighter touch, the insinuation and the passing reference are much more effective. We know this, and yet so often the grim awfulness of the bare truth is so insistent we feel it our duty to state it. Take those stark and awful corpses, men murdered by lynch law, in last month’s issue: it was a gruesome thing to publish, and yet—could the tale have been told otherwise? Can the nation otherwise awaken to the enormity of this beastly crime of crimes, this rape of law and decency? Could a neat joke or a light allusion make this nation realize what 2,500 murders such as these look like?\nWe trust that the Gall of Bitterness will not spoil the pages of The Crisis or make its readers to shudder at ill-timed frankness. But God forbid that mere considerations of pleasantry and sweetness should ever make us withhold insistence, in season and out, upon that which a Southern white correspondent of ours calls “the barbarous treatment accorded an unfortunate people by the strong and arrogant Caucasian. When Truth shall have come into her own, through the medium of education, the color line will be swept into oblivion of a dark and disgraceful past. Men will shudder at the deeds of their fathers, even as we shudder at the horrors of the Inquisition.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nDon’t Be Bitter (1914)\nThe Crisis (1910)\nThe Truth (1912)\nJoin or Die (1914)\nA Statement (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “The Gall of Bitterness.”\nThe Crisis 3 (4): 153. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/04/gail_of_bitterness.html."

    "text": "The were sitting on the leeward deck of the vessel and the colored man was there with his usual look of unconcern, before the seasickness his presence aboard had caused some upheaval. The Woman, for instance, glancing at the Southerner, had refused point blank to sit beside him at meals, so she had changed places with the Little Old Lady. The Westerner, who sat opposite, said he did not care a ——, then he looked at the Little Old Lady, and added in a lower voice to the New Yorker that there was no accounting for tastes. The Southerner from the other table broadened his back and tried to express with his shoulders both ancestors and hauteur. All this, however, was half forgotten during the seasickness, and the Woman sat beside the colored man for a full half hour before she noticed it. and then was glad to realize that the Southerner was too sick to see. Now again with sunshine and smiling weather, they all quite naturally reverted (did the Southerner suggest it?) to the Negro problem. The usual solutions had been suggested: education, work, emigration. etc.\nThey had not noticed the back of the colored man, until the thoughtless Westerner turned toward him and said breezily: “Well, now, what do you say? I guess you are rather interested.” The colored man was leaning over the rail and about to light his cigarette—he had several such bad habits, as the Little Old Lady noticed. The Southerner simply stared. Over the face of the colored man went the shadow of several expressions; some the New Yorker could interpret, others he could not.\n“I have,” said the colored man, with deliberation, “a perfect solution.” The Southerner selected a look of disdain from his repertoire, and assumed it. The Woman moved nearer, but partly turned her back. The Westerner and the Little Old Lady sat down. “Yes,” repeated the colored man. “I have a perfect solution. The trouble with most of the solutions which are generally suggested is that they aggravate the disease.” The Southerner could not help looking interested. “For instance,” proceeded the colored man, airily waving his hand, “take education; education means ambition, dissatisfaction and revolt. You cannot both educate people and hold them down.”\n“Then stop educating them,” growled the Southerner aside.\n“Or,” continued the colored man. “if the black man works, he must come into competition with whites——”\n“He sure will, and it ought to be stopped,” returned the Westerner. “It brings down wages.”\n“Precisely,” said the speaker, “and if by underselling the labor market he develops a few millionaires, how now would you protect your residential districts or your select social circles or—your daughters?”\nThe Southerner started angrily, but the colored man was continuing placidly with a far-off look in his eyes. “Now, migration is both costly and inhuman; the transportation would be the smallest matter. You must buy up perhaps a thousand millions’ worth of Negro property; you must furnish some capital for the masses of poor; you must get some place for them to go; you must protect them there, and here you must pay not only higher wages to white men, but still higher on account of the labor scarcity. Meantime, the Negroes suddenly removed from one climate and social system to another climate and utterly new conditions would die in droves—it would be simply prolonged murder at enormous cost.”\n“Very well,” continued the colored man, seating himself and throwing away his cigarette, “listen to my plan.” looking almost quizzically at the Little Old Lady: “you must not be alarmed at its severity—it may seem radical, but really it is—it is—well, it is quite the only practical thing and it has surely one advantage: it settles the problem once, suddenly, and forever. My plan is this:”S ou now outnumber us nearly ten to one. I propose that on a certain date, shall we say next Christmas, or possibly Easter, 1912? No, come to think of it, the first of January, 1913, would, for historical reasons, probably be best. Well, then, on the first of January, 1913, let each person who has a colored friend invite him to dinner. This would take care of a few; among such friends might be included the black mammies and faithful old servants of the South; in this way we could get together quite a number. Then those who have not the pleasure of black friends might arrange for meetings, especially in ‘white’ churches and Young Men’s and Young Women’s Christian Associations, where Negroes are not expected. At such meetings, contrary to custom, the black people should not be seated by themselves, but distributed very carefully among the whites. The remaining Negroes who could not be flattered or attracted by these invitations should be induced to assemble among themselves at their own churches or at little parties and house warmings.”\n“The few stragglers, vagrants and wanderers could be put under careful watch and ward. Now, then, we have the thing in shape. First, the hosts of those invited to dine should provide themselves with a sufficient quantity of cyanide of potassium, placing it carefully in the proper cups, and being careful not to mix the cups. Those at church and prayer meeting could choose between long sharp stilettoes and pistols—I should recommend the former as less noisy. Those who guard the colored assemblies and the stragglers without should carefully surround the groups and use Winchesters. Then, at a given signal, let the colored folk of the United States be quietly dispatched; the signal might be a church bell or the singing of the national hymn; probably the bell would be best, for the diners would be eating.”\nBy this time the auditors of the colored man were staring; the Southerner had forgotten to pose; the Woman had forgotten to watch the Southerner; the Westerner was staring with admiration; there were tears in the eyes of the Little Old Lady, while the New Yorker was smiling; but the colored man held up a deprecating hand: “Now don’t prejudge my plan,” he urged. “The next morning there would be ten million funerals, and therefore no Negro problem. Think how quietly the thing would be settled; no more bother, no more argument; the whole country united and happy. Even the Negroes would be a great deal happier than they are at present. Instead of being made heirs to hope by education, or ambitious by wealth, or exiled invalids on the fever coast, they would all be happily ensconced in Heaven. Of course, I admit that at first the plan may seem a little abrupt and cruel, and yet is it more cruel than present conditions, and would it not be well to be a little more abrupt in our social solutions? At any rate think it over,” and the colored man dropped lazily into his steamer chair and felt for another cigarette.\nThe crowd slowly dispersed: the Southerner chose the Woman, but was heard to say something about fools. The Westerner turned to the New Yorker and said: “Now, what in hell do you suppose that darky meant?” But the Little Old Lady went silently to her cabin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Matter of Manners (1920)\nPrecept and Practice (1910)\nA Little Play (1914)\nLight (1912)\nBooze (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “A Mild Suggestion.”\nThe Crisis 3 (3): 115–16. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/03/mild_suggestion.html."

The magazine’s success was a testament to Du Bois’s ability to blend intellectual rigor with accessible prose, poetry, and photographs, making complex social and political issues comprehensible to a diverse readership.\nThis collection of articles from Du Bois’s editorial tenure provides invaluable insights into the evolution of African American thought and the strategies employed in the fight for civil rights during the early 20th century.

    "text": "The Moon and Horizon (1900—1910)\nBefore founding The Crisis in 1910, W.E.B. Du Bois launched two lesser-known but significant journalistic ventures that shaped his approach to Black media. These publications, The Moon Illustrated Weekly (1905-1906) and Horizon: A Journal of the Color Line (1907-1910), served as crucial precursors to The Crisis and played pivotal roles in developing Du Bois’s vision for an independent Black press.\nBoth The Moon and Horizon shared a commitment to promoting racial pride, challenging the status quo, and providing a platform for African American intellectual discourse. However, they each faced significant challenges, including limited readership, financial constraints, and opposition from more conservative Black publications. Despite struggling with inconsistent publication schedules and criticism for their radical stances, the lessons learned from these early efforts significantly influenced Du Bois’s later success with The Crisis (1910-present) and contributed to his enduring impact on African American journalism in the early 20th century.\nThese early journalistic endeavors by Du Bois emerged from within a complex and dynamic landscape of African American journalism at the turn of the 20th century. This media environment reflected the diverse perspectives and competing visions within the Black community, providing the context in which Du Bois’s publications sought to make their mark. In an era marked by racial segregation and discrimination, Black-owned and operated publications played a vital role in serving the informational and cultural needs of African Americans. These publications grappled with fundamental questions about the goals and strategies of racial advancement, and their debates shaped the intellectual and political discourse of the time. Du Bois’s The Moon and Horizon entered this arena, contributing to and challenging the existing narratives within the Black press.\n One of the most influential publications of this period was The Colored American Magazine, founded in 1900 as the first major African American journal of the new century. Under the editorship of Pauline Hopkins from 1900 to 1904, the magazine aimed to cultivate a national Black readership and promote racial pride and unity. Hopkins used the platform to explore Black history, critique the exclusion of African American experiences from mainstream textbooks, and encourage a Black literary renaissance. The magazine’s coverage of politics, business, education, and religion, alongside its inclusion of historical materials and fiction, set a significant precedent for later publications.\nHowever, the Black press of this era was divided by ideological differences, particularly between supporters of Booker T. Washington’s accommodationist philosophy and those who advocated for more direct challenges to racial injustice. Washington exerted considerable influence over several publications, often using them to promote his views on economic development as the primary means of racial progress. This influence was not always transparent, as in the case of The Colored American Magazine, which Washington secretly subsidized after Hopkins’ departure in 1904.\n In contrast, more radical voices found expression in publications like The Voice of the Negro, launched in Atlanta in 1904 as the first Black-edited journal in the South. Under the editorship of J. Max Barber, The Voice of the Negro became a platform for more confrontational expressions of racial politics, featuring articles by Du Bois that critiqued Washington’s approach. The magazine’s outspoken nature made it a target for pressure from Washington and his supporters, foreshadowing the challenges Du Bois would face in his own journalistic endeavors.\nThe challenges faced by independent Black journalism in this period are illustrated by the fates of these publications. The Colored American Magazine ceased publication in 1910 after losing Washington’s support, while The Voice of the Negro, forced to relocate to Chicago after the 1906 Atlanta race riot, ended its run in 1907. These closures highlight the financial and political pressures that constrained African American publications, providing context for the significance of Du Bois’s subsequent journalistic efforts.\nIt was in this complex and contentious media landscape that W.E.B. Du Bois launched his own journalistic ventures, The Moon Illustrated Weekly and Horizon. These publications emerged as attempts to provide alternatives to the Washington-influenced press, offering platforms for more radical political expression and cultural exploration. Du Bois’s efforts were part of a broader struggle within the Black press to define the means and ends of racial advancement in America.\n In December 1905, W.E.B. Du Bois, along with partners Edward L. Simon and Harry Pace, launched The Moon Illustrated Weekly in Memphis, Tennessee, marking a significant milestone as the first illustrated weekly magazine for African Americans. With an initial investment of $3,000, The Moon aimed to interpret what Du Bois called a “new race consciousness” to the world, reflecting the growing self-awareness and cultural pride within the Black community.\nThe content of The Moon was diverse and ambitious. It featured news items on Africa, reprints from other publications, biographical sketches of notable African Americans, and thought-provoking editorials. The magazine also showcased illustrations, likely drawn by Du Bois himself, and carried advertisements from Black-owned businesses in Memphis and Atlanta. A notable piece published in The Moon was a tribute to the late poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, reflecting the magazine’s commitment to celebrating African American culture and achievement.\nHowever, The Moon faced significant challenges from its inception. Its controversial nature and radical stance limited its audience to between 250 and 500 subscribers, creating financial constraints for the expensive publication. This small readership, combined with limited resources, put immense pressure on the venture. Moreover, Du Bois’s commitments to other activities prevented him from dedicating sufficient time to editing the magazine, further complicating its operations\nThe reception of The Moon was mixed. While it elicited commentary and sparked discussions in the Black press, it also faced mockery from accommodationist periodicals that highlighted its financial struggles. Despite its short lifespan, ending in the summer of 1906, The Moon set an important precedent for African American illustrated journalism.\nFollowing the demise of The Moon, Du Bois swiftly launched his next journalistic venture. In January 1907, Horizon: A Journal of the Color Line began publication in Washington, D.C., later relocating to Alexandria, Virginia. Owned and operated by Freeman Murray and Lafayette M. Hershaw, with Du Bois serving as editor, Horizon provided a more enduring platform for Du Bois’s views and those of the Niagara Movement, a civil rights organization he had co-founded in 1905 to oppose racial segregation and disenfranchisement.\nHorizon represented a significant evolution in Du Bois’s journalistic approach. It featured sharper critiques and covered a wider range of topics than its predecessor. The magazine’s content was notably more memorable, with contributions from talented writers like L.M. Hershaw and F.H.M. Murray. Du Bois’s “Over-Look” section became increasingly controversial, challenging the status quo and proposing political alternatives to the dominant narratives of the time.\n Horizon’s content reflected Du Bois’s increasingly bold editorial stance. The magazine published a scathing critique of Thomas Fortune, a close associate of Booker T. Washington and editor of The New York Age, and openly criticized President Theodore Roosevelt’s positions on racial issues. Moreover, it expanded its scope beyond domestic concerns. The magazine covered global issues affecting Black people, including peonage and imperialism, reflecting Du Bois’s growing interest in international affairs and their impact on the African diaspora. Additionally, Horizon became a vehicle for Du Bois’s evolving views on socialism and labor rights, topics that would become increasingly central to his intellectual and activist work in later years.\n\n\n\nA 1909 letter from Du Bois annoucing a temporary suspension of The Horizon because of “lax business methods.”\n\n\nDespite its intellectual richness, Horizon faced persistent financial difficulties. Du Bois rejected the idea of subsidies, considering them “degrading and dangerous,” which meant the magazine had to rely on its readership for support. The editors worked without salaries and often covered the annual deficit out of their own pockets. Du Bois repeatedly appealed to readers for donations and additional subscribers to keep the magazine afloat.\nThe experiences gained from publishing The Moon and Horizon were invaluable in shaping Du Bois’s approach to journalism and his understanding of the challenges facing independent Black publications. These ventures demonstrated the difficulty of sustaining a magazine that advocated for unpopular causes without a solid financial base or institutional support.\nThe financial struggles of both magazines highlighted the economic realities of the African American community at the time. Du Bois’s frustration with the lack of support from the Black community for independent publications like Horizon underscored the complex relationship between radical Black intellectuals and the broader African American population, a tension that would continue to shape his approach to activism and journalism in the years to come.\n\nEstablishing The Crisis (1910-1915)\nThe early 20th century marked a pivotal moment in the struggle for civil rights in the United States, with the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909 and the subsequent launch of its official magazine, The Crisis, in 1910. This period saw W.E.B. Du Bois transition from his academic role at Atlanta University to become a leading figure in the nascent civil rights movement, utilizing his position as editor of The Crisis to shape public opinion and challenge prevailing racial attitudes.\nThe Crisis emerged from the broader context of the NAACP’s formation, which itself was a response to escalating racial tensions, exemplified by the 1908 race riots in Springfield, Illinois. This violent outbreak in Abraham Lincoln’s hometown shocked both Black and white reformers, prompting journalist William English Walling to call for a national conference to address racial issues. The resulting National Negro Conference, held in New York City on May 31 and June 1, 1909, brought together a diverse coalition of civil rights activists, both Black and white, committed to challenging racial discrimination through legal and political means. Attendees included prominent figures such as Ida B. Wells-Barnett, William Monroe Trotter, and W.E.B. Du Bois, alongside white philanthropists and social reformers. This interracial composition distinguished the NAACP from earlier civil rights organizations and set the stage for a more assertive approach to activism. The conference led to the formal establishment of the NAACP in 1909, with the organization promising to vigorously oppose racial hatred and prejudice.\nW.E.B. Du Bois, already a renowned scholar and author, was recruited to join the executive committee as its only African American member and appointed as the director of Publications and Research. Du Bois, who had been influential in shaping the thoughts of many of the NAACP’s white organizers through his writings and lectures, saw the organization as an opportunity to challenge Booker T. Washington’s accommodationist approach to race relations. When offered the position of Director of Publicity and Research at the NAACP, Du Bois viewed it as a chance to guide educated African American opinion and to fight for civil rights more directly than he could in his academic position.\nHowever, not all prominent activists found such a welcoming place within the nascent organization. Despite her considerable skills and experience in journalism and civil rights advocacy, Ida B. Wells found herself sidelined in the early days of the NAACP. Wells, who had gained international recognition for her anti-lynching campaigns and her work as editor and co-owner of the Memphis Free Speech newspaper, was not included in the original list of NAACP founders. This exclusion was particularly striking given her extensive experience in investigative journalism, her powerful writing on racial injustice, and her established network of supporters both in the United States and abroad. While the exact reasons for her omission remain disputed, with Du Bois later implying it was Wells’ choice and Wells asserting in her autobiography that she was deliberately excluded, the incident highlighted the complex dynamics of race, gender, and power within the early civil rights movement. Despite these internal tensions, Du Bois pressed forward with his plans for the NAACP’s official publication.\nDu Bois’s vision for The Crisis was multifaceted. He intended the magazine to serve as a platform for recording important events affecting race relations, reviewing opinions and literature on race issues, providing a forum for articles, and advocating for equal rights regardless of color. This ambitious scope reflected Du Bois’s belief in the power of informed public opinion to drive social change.\nThe initial funding and support for The Crisis were uncertain. The NAACP did not have funds allocated for the publication initially, but Oswald Garrison Villard, owner of the New York Evening Post and The Nation, provided office space and provisional support. This precarious financial situation underscored the challenges faced by civil rights organizations in the early 20th century and the determination of individuals like Du Bois to persevere despite limited resources.\nThe first issue of The Crisis was published on November 1, 1910, with a modest circulation of 1,000 copies and a subscription price of $1 per year. Despite initial skepticism about the magazine’s potential success, The Crisis quickly gained popularity. By December 1910, Du Bois had doubled the number of pages and increased the print run to 2,500 copies. The magazine’s circulation grew rapidly, reaching 3,000 in January 1911, 4,000 in February, and 6,000 in March. By April 1912, circulation had soared to 22,500 copies.\nThe Crisis provided comprehensive coverage of civil rights issues, with a particular focus on lynching and racial violence. Du Bois used the magazine to expose the dangers of race prejudice and to advocate for legal and political solutions to racial inequality. However, his vision for The Crisis extended far beyond merely reporting NAACP activities, which led to tensions within the organization. While some NAACP board members wanted the magazine to function primarily as an organizational newsletter, Du Bois saw it as a powerful tool for inspiring and mobilizing the African American community. This approach was reflected in the magazine’s diverse content. The “Along the Color Line” section contained news items about Black individuals, similar to a small-town newspaper, while the “Opinion” section featured Du Bois’s commentary on important events from the perspective of various newspapers. He insisted that The Crisis needed to impart a larger vision, preparing the ground for widespread organization and civil rights activism. Du Bois argued that this broad, often provocative editorial approach was essential for building the NAACP’s presence and influence. He believed that without the magnetism and inspiration provided by The Crisis, the NAACP would struggle to achieve its larger goals. This stance often put him at odds with those who preferred a more cautious, less controversial publication.\nDu Bois’s writing style and approach were central to the development of The Crisis’s distinctive editorial voice. He used the magazine to challenge Booker T. Washington’s accommodationist approach and to promote a more militant stance on civil rights. Du Bois’s editorials were often controversial and confrontational, addressing taboo subjects like interracial marriage and critiquing not just white racism but also Black institutions he saw as ineffective.\nWhile The Crisis primarily targeted an educated Black audience, featuring articles on topics such as “Colored High Schools,” “Women’s Clubs,” and “The Colored College Athlete,” Du Bois also sought to make the magazine accessible to a broader readership. He balanced intellectual content with practical information and news relevant to African American communities of various educational backgrounds. This approach allowed The Crisis to appeal to a diverse readership, covering a wide range of topics including lynching, women’s suffrage, labor issues, and socialism.\nThe use of photographs and artwork in The Crisis was innovative for its time and played a crucial role in shaping the magazine’s visual identity. Du Bois recognized the power of visual representation in challenging racial stereotypes and promoting Black achievement. The magazine often featured portraits of successful African Americans, contributing to a positive image of Black culture and accomplishment. This visual strategy complemented the diverse content, further enhancing the magazine’s appeal and impact.\nThe Crisis also benefited from the contributions of key staff members and collaborators. Mary Maclean, a journalist for the New York Times, served as the managing editor, while Robert N. Wood, an African American printer, produced the magazine at a reduced cost. This combination of editorial expertise and practical support was crucial in establishing The Crisis as a reputable and influential publication.\nThe magazine’s impact on African American communities was significant. Many readers, particularly those from the growing Black middle class, regarded The Crisis reverently. It served as a source of information, inspiration, and racial pride, with families often reading it aloud and preserving issues for future reference.\nIn contrast, the reaction from white readers and critics to The Crisis was mixed, reflecting broader tensions within the NAACP. While some progressive whites supported the magazine’s mission, others were alarmed by its provocative content and militant stance on civil rights. The success and influence of The Crisis, though beneficial to the NAACP’s overall mission, generated significant conflicts between Du Bois and white NAACP officials, particularly Oswald Garrison Villard. As chairman of the NAACP board and an experienced newspaper owner, Villard sought to exert control over The Crisis, viewing it as subject to his authority. Du Bois, however, fiercely guarded his editorial independence, insisting that his role transcended that of a mere employee. Their clashes extended beyond editorial matters to issues of financial management and Du Bois’s allocation of time between The Crisis and other NAACP duties. The NAACP board, composed primarily of progressive white members, often found Du Bois’s content too inflammatory and worried about its potential to alienate white supporters and distract from the organization’s legal and organizational work. These conflicts intensified over time, culminating in Villard’s resignation as board chairman in 1913. Despite attempts to limit Du Bois’s autonomy, including the official incorporation of The Crisis as a separate entity from the NAACP in 1914, the board ultimately had to accommodate Du Bois’s leadership of the magazine. This was largely due to The Crisis’s crucial role in mobilizing African American support and its early financial success. This ongoing struggle reflected deeper tensions within the civil rights movement about the appropriate strategies for achieving racial equality, the balance between protest and accommodation, and the role of Black leadership within interracial organizations."

    "section": "War and Its Aftermath (1916-1923)",
    "text": "War and Its Aftermath (1916-1923)\nAs the United States entered World War I, The Crisis under Du Bois’s editorship became a vital platform for reporting on the experiences of African American soldiers and the broader impact of the war on the black community. The magazine provided extensive coverage of military segregation and discrimination, highlighting the paradox of African Americans fighting for democracy abroad while facing systemic racism at home. Du Bois used The Crisis to document instances of mistreatment and harassment faced by black soldiers in training camps across the country, including incidents in Georgia, Kansas, and Texas.\nHowever, Du Bois’s wartime stance was not without controversy. In July 1918, he penned the editorial “Close Ranks,” urging African Americans to set aside their grievances and support the war effort. This position, which seemed to contradict Du Bois’s previous advocacy for immediate civil rights reforms, drew sharp criticism from many African Americans and NAACP members. The controversy was further fueled by Du Bois’s consideration of a military intelligence position, leading to accusations of a quid pro quo arrangement. Although Du Bois denied any connection between the editorial and the job offer, the incident damaged his reputation and led to increased scrutiny of The Crisis by the NAACP board.\nDespite this setback, Du Bois continued to use The Crisis as a platform for investigating and reporting on the treatment of African American troops. In December 1918, he traveled to France as part of the official press delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, where he gathered information on the experiences of black soldiers. The May 1919 issue of The Crisis, which included Du Bois’s influential editorial “Returning Soldiers” and documents about the mistreatment of black troops, sold a record 106,000 copies, demonstrating the magazine’s growing influence and readership.\nThe aftermath of World War I brought new challenges for African Americans, as racial violence escalated across the United States. The Crisis played a crucial role in documenting and responding to the wave of racial violence known as the “Red Summer” of 1919. Du Bois used the magazine to report on the numerous race riots and lynchings that occurred during this period, providing detailed accounts and analysis of events in cities like East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas. The Crisis’s coverage of these incidents not only informed its readers but also served as a call to action, advocating for federal anti-lynching legislation and other measures to protect African American lives and rights.\nThe Great Migration, a massive movement of African Americans from the rural South to urban areas in the North and West, was a defining phenomenon of early 20th-century American history. Du Bois, recognizing the importance of this movement, devoted considerable attention to covering its various aspects in the pages of The Crisis. In early 1917, Du Bois undertook a personal journey through the southern states to gather firsthand information on the migration. This investigative trip reflected his commitment to empirical research, a hallmark of his earlier academic work. By traveling to the source of the migration, Du Bois aimed to provide Crisis readers with accurate, nuanced reporting on the factors driving African Americans to leave the South and the challenges they faced in doing so Du Bois’s views on the Great Migration, as expressed in The Crisis, were complex and evolving. While he encouraged resourceful African Americans to seek better opportunities in the North, he also acknowledged the significant challenges that awaited migrants in their new urban environments.\nThe magazine’s reporting on the Great Migration went beyond mere demographic analysis. It explored the social, economic, and political implications of this mass movement. Articles in The Crisis examined how the influx of African Americans was changing northern cities, the reception migrants received from both white and established black communities, and the impact of the migration on labor markets and racial dynamics in both the North and South.\nDuring this period, Du Bois also expanded The Crisis’s international focus, connecting the struggles of African Americans to global anti-colonial movements. He organized and presided over the Pan-African Congress in Paris in February 1919, which brought together delegates from 16 nations to discuss issues affecting people of African descent worldwide. The Congress passed resolutions calling for better treatment of African colonies and greater international oversight of colonial administration. Du Bois used The Crisis to report on these developments and to promote his vision of pan-Africanism, which sought to unite people of African descent globally in the fight against racism and colonialism.\nHowever, Du Bois’s approach to advancing African American interests faced a significant challenge from Marcus Garvey and his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Initially cautious, Du Bois observed Garvey’s movement without direct confrontation. However, as Garvey’s influence grew, Du Bois became increasingly critical. He used The Crisis to publish detailed critiques of Garvey’s Black Star Line and other UNIA ventures, highlighting the ideological divide between their approaches to racial advancement.\nThe conflict between Du Bois and Garvey represented a broader struggle within the African American community over strategies for racial advancement and leadership. While Du Bois advocated for integration and civil rights within the United States, Garvey promoted racial separatism and a return to Africa. This ideological divide was reflected in the pages of The Crisis, where Du Bois consistently presented his vision for racial advancement, which contrasted sharply with Garvey’s approach.\nThroughout this period, The Crisis continued to grow in influence and reach. By 1919, its monthly circulation exceeded 100,000, surpassing that of other prominent publications like The New Republic and The Nation. The magazine’s success allowed Du Bois to expand its content and launch new initiatives, such as The Brownie’s Book, a children’s magazine aimed at fostering pride and knowledge among young African Americans. The Brownie’s Book was revolutionary for its time, offering positive representations of Black children and families that were sorely lacking in mainstream literature. Each issue featured a mix of stories, poems, biographies of notable African Americans, and articles on African and African American history and culture. The magazine encouraged its young readers to take pride in their heritage and to aspire to academic and professional success. Du Bois, along with co-editors Jessie Redmon Fauset and Augustus Granville Dill, ensured that the content was both entertaining and educational, often addressing complex social issues in an age-appropriate manner. Although The Brownie’s Book only ran for two years due to financial constraints, its impact was significant. It paved the way for future African American children’s literature and demonstrated Du Bois’s commitment to uplifting the entire Black community, from the youngest members to the oldest.\nHowever, the early 1920s also brought challenges for The Crisis and Du Bois. The magazine experienced a sharp decline in subscribers, dropping from over 100,000 in August 1919 to 53,000 in April 1921. This decline led to financial difficulties and tensions between Du Bois and the NAACP board over the management of the magazine and its relationship to the organization."

    "section": "The Harlem Renaissance and Beyond (1924-1928)",
    "text": "The Harlem Renaissance and Beyond (1924-1928)\nUnder Du Bois’s leadership, The Crisis became a vital platform for nurturing and showcasing African American talent during the Harlem Renaissance. The magazine instituted literary contests and awards, most notably the Krigwa awards, which provided emerging writers and poets with opportunities for recognition and publication. These initiatives were instrumental in discovering and promoting new voices in African American literature, contributing significantly to the cultural flourishing of the period. Du Bois’s commitment to fostering black artistic expression was greatly aided by Jessie Redmon Fauset, who served as the magazine’s literary editor from 1919 to 1926. Fauset, herself a notable author of the Harlem Renaissance, played a crucial role in identifying and nurturing new talent. Her discerning editorial eye helped launch the careers of several prominent writers, including Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, and Jean Toomer. Hughes, in particular, gained early recognition when his poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” was published in The Crisis in 1921, marking the beginning of his career.\nThe Crisis’s influence extended beyond just discovering new talent; it also provided a platform for established intellectuals and artists to reach a wider audience. Zora Neale Hurston, already gaining recognition for her anthropological work and vibrant prose, contributed several pieces to the magazine, further cementing her place in the literary world. Additionally, the sociologist and civil rights activist E. Franklin Frazier found in The Crisis a venue for his incisive analyses of racial issues, helping to establish his reputation as a leading scholar in his field.\nThe Crisis’s commitment to fostering black artistic expression extended beyond literature. The magazine regularly featured photographs of prosperous African American citizens and Greek letter organizations, visually reinforcing the idea of racial uplift and cultural refinement that Du Bois championed. This visual representation, combined with the literary content, helped create a comprehensive portrait of African American achievement and potential. The magazine also showcased the work of African American visual artists, providing exposure for painters and sculptors like Aaron Douglas, whose distinctive style became synonymous with the visual aesthetic of the Harlem Renaissance. Augusta Savage, the renowned sculptor, received early recognition in The Crisis, which helped propel her career and visibility in the art world.\nMoreover, The Crisis served as a launching pad for future leaders in various fields. A young Thurgood Marshall, who would later become the first African American Supreme Court Justice, had his early writings published in the magazine, foreshadowing his future role in the civil rights movement. Similarly, Paul Robeson, the multitalented actor, singer, and activist, found in The Crisis a platform to express his views on art and politics, contributing to his rising prominence in both cultural and political spheres.\nAs the Harlem Renaissance progressed, The Crisis became a forum for intense debates about the appropriate representation of black life in art and literature. Du Bois articulated his views on this matter in his seminal essay “Criteria of Negro Art,” published in The Crisis. In this piece, he argued for art that would serve as propaganda for African American advancement, emphasizing the need for positive portrayals that could counteract negative stereotypes.\nThis stance, however, brought Du Bois into conflict with younger artists who sought to explore the full spectrum of black experience, including aspects that Du Bois and other older intellectuals considered unseemly or detrimental to the race’s image. The Crisis editor’s criticism of works like Claude McKay’s “Home to Harlem” for their portrayal of the seedier aspects of black urban life exemplified this generational and ideological divide.\nAs the 1920s progressed, The Crisis began to place increased emphasis on education and economic development within the African American community. The magazine published special annual issues dedicated to higher education, reflecting Du Bois’s longstanding belief in the importance of advanced learning for racial progress. These issues reported on developments in black colleges and universities, advocating for increased African American representation in faculty and administration positions.\nSimultaneously, The Crisis amplified its coverage of African American businesses and economic initiatives. This shift mirrored Du Bois’s evolving thoughts on his “Talented Tenth” concept. While he maintained his belief in the importance of higher education, Du Bois began to criticize what he perceived as growing materialism and class distinctions among college-educated African Americans. He used the pages of The Crisis to call for a reevaluation of curricula in black colleges, emphasizing the need for vocational training and industrial planning to address the economic challenges faced by the broader African American population.\nDu Bois championed the development of what he termed a “closed economic circle” within the African American community. Through The Crisis, he encouraged the Talented Tenth to invest in economic projects and establish cooperative businesses to uplift the race. However, these efforts faced challenges due to limited support from the African American middle class, who often prioritized individual advancement over collective economic strategies.\nThe Crisis’s shift in focus during this period reflected broader changes in Du Bois’s thinking about racial advancement. While continuing to promote cultural and artistic achievement, the magazine increasingly grappled with the economic realities facing African Americans in the late 1920s. This evolution in editorial direction set the stage for the more radical economic and political positions that Du Bois would adopt in the following decade."

    "section": "Economic Crisis and Ideological Shifts (1929-1932)",
    "text": "Economic Crisis and Ideological Shifts (1929-1932)\nThe onset of the Great Depression in 1929 marked a pivotal moment for W.E.B. Du Bois and The Crisis magazine, ushering in a period of financial struggle and ideological transformation. As the economic downturn gripped the nation, The Crisis, like many publications, faced declining circulation and mounting financial pressures. By 1932, the magazine’s monthly readership had plummeted to approximately 15,000, a stark contrast to its earlier success. This decline not only threatened the magazine’s survival but also compromised Du Bois’s editorial independence as The Crisis became increasingly reliant on subsidies from the NAACP.\nThe financial strain experienced by The Crisis mirrored the broader economic hardships faced by African American communities across the United States. Du Bois used the magazine as a platform to document and critique the disproportionate impact of the Depression on Black Americans. Through his editorials and articles, he shed light on the exacerbated racial inequalities and the inadequacies of government responses to The Crisis. This coverage served not only to inform readers but also to galvanize support for more robust economic interventions targeting African American communities.\nAs the economic situation deteriorated, Du Bois began to reevaluate his understanding of capitalism and explore alternative economic models. This period saw him delve deeper into the study of Marxism, reflecting a broader trend among African American intellectuals of the time. The Crisis became a forum for discussions on socialism, communism, and other progressive economic theories. Du Bois’s growing conviction that capitalism had failed led him to advocate for increased government direction of the economy, a position that put him at odds with more conservative elements within the NAACP leadership.\nDu Bois’s interest in communism and alternative economic models began to take shape well before the economic crisis of 1929. His trip to the Soviet Union in 1926 played a significant role in shaping his views. During this two-month journey, Du Bois was deeply impressed by what he perceived as a society striving for a new way of life through education and equality. He observed the Soviet emphasis on workers’ empowerment and noted the apparent lack of racial prejudice. This experience led him to declare that if what he had seen was Bolshevism, then he considered himself a Bolshevik. While he remained cautious about fully embracing communist ideology, the visit sparked a deeper interest in Marxist thought and alternative economic structures. Du Bois began to view class struggle as a dilemma comparable in magnitude to racial issues, though he continued to assert that race relations in America complicated a straightforward application of Marxist class analysis.\nIn 1932, The Crisis published a significant symposium titled “Negro Editors on Communism,” which explored the potential relevance of Marxist thought to the African American experience. This initiative reflected Du Bois’s commitment to engaging with radical economic ideas, even as it risked alienating some of the magazine’s more moderate readers and supporters. The symposium sparked debates among Black leaders about the most effective economic strategies for advancing racial equality in the context of the Great Depression.\nDu Bois’s ideological shift extended beyond economic theory to encompass evolving views on race and segregation. As the harsh realities of the Depression highlighted the limitations of existing approaches to racial advancement, Du Bois began to reconsider his stance on racial integration. He increasingly explored concepts of Black self-sufficiency and economic separatism as potential strategies for community development and empowerment.\nThis exploration of separatist ideas marked a significant departure from Du Bois’s earlier emphasis on integration and provoked mixed reactions from NAACP leadership and Crisis readers alike. Some viewed his new direction as a pragmatic response to the economic crisis, while others saw it as a retreat from the organization’s core principles of racial equality and integration.\nDu Bois’s shifting perspectives were reflected in his proposal to reorganize the NAACP to focus more directly on economic issues affecting the African American masses. At the association’s annual conference in May 1932, he presented a four-point program calling for decentralization, a positive economic agenda, linking global and American racial issues, and greater youth involvement. This proposal underscored Du Bois’s belief that addressing economic inequality was crucial to advancing racial justice.\nHowever, Du Bois’s new economic focus and more radical ideological stance met with resistance from Walter White and other NAACP leaders who favored a more moderate approach. This ideological divide contributed to growing tensions between Du Bois and the NAACP board, foreshadowing the eventual end of his tenure at The Crisis.\nThe financial struggles of The Crisis came to a head in late 1932, with Du Bois resorting to using part of his own salary to keep the magazine afloat. The NAACP board, faced with dire financial constraints, considered suspending publication entirely. This crisis led to discussions about Du Bois’s future role, with NAACP board chair Joel Spingarn arranging for Du Bois to be offered a professorship at Atlanta University for the spring of 1933, anticipating the end of his leadership at The Crisis."

    "section": "Final Struggles and Departure (1933-1934)",
    "text": "Final Struggles and Departure (1933-1934)\nThe twilight years of W.E.B. Du Bois’s tenure at The Crisis and the NAACP were marked by contentious ideological shifts, organizational conflicts, and ultimately, his departure from the institutions he had helped build. This period from 1933 to 1934 witnessed Du Bois grappling with new economic realities, proposing controversial solutions, and facing increasing opposition from within the civil rights movement he had long championed.\nAs the Great Depression deepened, Du Bois began to reevaluate his views on race relations and economic strategies for African Americans. In January 1934, he published a provocative article titled “Segregation” in The Crisis, arguing that racial segregation could potentially yield positive outcomes if it led to self-sufficiency and development within the Black community. This stance represented a significant departure from the NAACP’s longstanding opposition to all forms of segregation.\nDu Bois’s evolving perspective was further evident in his proposal for new economic programs tailored to African Americans. He advocated for the creation of cooperative and collective economies within the Black community, suggesting that this approach could offer a path to economic empowerment in the face of systemic discrimination. These ideas were influenced by Du Bois’s renewed study of Marxist thought, which he believed was necessary to develop a comprehensive social and economic program for African Americans.\nThe reaction to Du Bois’s new positions was swift and largely negative. Many civil rights leaders and activists, including those within the NAACP, viewed his stance on segregation as a betrayal of the organization’s core principles. Critics argued that embracing segregation, even as a means to an end, would undermine decades of progress in the fight for racial equality.\nDu Bois’s controversial views exacerbated existing tensions between him and the NAACP leadership, particularly Walter White. The conflict centered on issues of editorial control and content in The Crisis, as well as broader disagreements on organizational strategy and priorities. As early as 1932, Du Bois had been at odds with White and Roy Wilkins over the direction of The Crisis. Du Bois resisted attempts to bring the magazine under closer NAACP control, viewing such efforts as threats to his editorial freedom and intellectual independence. The situation deteriorated further when Du Bois used The Crisis as a platform to criticize the NAACP’s approach to civil rights and to promote his own views on segregation and economic self-reliance.\nThe ideological rift between Du Bois and the NAACP board widened as he pushed for a fundamental reorganization of the association. Du Bois called for greater involvement of working-class African Americans in the NAACP’s decision-making processes and advocated for a more democratic structure within the organization. These proposals were met with resistance from the board, which saw them as challenges to their authority and the established direction of the NAACP.\nPersonal conflicts also played a role in the deteriorating relationship. Du Bois’s critiques of Walter White and other NAACP leaders became increasingly pointed, while White and his allies worked to consolidate their power within the organization. The appointment of Roy Wilkins to the board of The Crisis Publishing Company, which Du Bois vehemently opposed, further strained relations.\nThe culmination of these conflicts came in May 1934 when the NAACP board voted to censor Du Bois and prohibit salaried officers from criticizing the association’s policies in The Crisis. This move was a direct response to Du Bois’s continued advocacy for his controversial views on segregation and economics. Faced with what he perceived as unacceptable constraints on his intellectual freedom, Du Bois resigned from The Crisis and the NAACP on June 26, 1934. In his resignation, he cited his refusal to accept censorship and his belief that the organization had failed to adapt to new economic realities facing African Americans.\nThe immediate reactions to Du Bois’s departure were mixed. While some viewed it as a necessary step to maintain the NAACP’s ideological consistency, others saw it as the loss of a powerful and influential voice in the civil rights movement. The Baltimore Afro-American newspaper, reflecting a sentiment shared by some, suggested that it was time for Du Bois to retire, indicating a generational shift in civil rights leadership.\nDespite the controversy surrounding his departure, Du Bois’s long-term impact on civil rights journalism and activism through his work at The Crisis was profound and lasting. Over his 24-year tenure, he had transformed The Crisis into a powerful platform for African American intellectual discourse, cultural expression, and political advocacy. The magazine had played a crucial role in shaping public opinion, nurturing Black literary talent during the Harlem Renaissance, and providing a forum for debates on strategies for advancing civil rights.\nDu Bois’s emphasis on economic issues and his willingness to challenge orthodox thinking, even when it led to his ouster, helped broaden the scope of civil rights activism. His departure from the NAACP marked a shift in the organization’s approach under Walter White’s leadership, with a renewed focus on legal strategies and integration. In the years following Du Bois’s resignation, the NAACP grappled with the issues he had raised, forming a committee to reassess its program and address the economic challenges facing Black Americans during the Great Depression. While not all of Du Bois’s ideas were adopted, his influence continued to be felt in ongoing debates within the civil rights movement about the best strategies for achieving racial equality and economic justice.\nW.E.B. Du Bois’s departure from The Crisis in 1934 marked the end of an era, but the impact of his quarter-century at the helm of this influential publication reverberates to this day. Through the articles collected in this site, we have traced the evolution of Du Bois’s thought, from his early advocacy for civil rights and integration to his later exploration of economic separatism and critique of capitalism.\nDu Bois’s tenure at The Crisis was characterized by an unwavering commitment to intellectual rigor, a willingness to challenge orthodoxies—including his own—and a deep-seated belief in the power of the written word to effect social change. His editorial vision expanded the boundaries of civil rights discourse, interweaving issues of race with questions of class, gender, and global politics.\nThe legacy of Du Bois’s work at The Crisis extends far beyond the pages of the magazine. His journalistic endeavors laid the groundwork for future generations of African American writers and activists, demonstrating the crucial role of an independent Black press in articulating and advancing the cause of racial justice. Moreover, the issues Du Bois grappled with in these pages, economic inequality, political representation, cultural identity, and the global dimensions of racial oppression, remain strikingly relevant in our contemporary context. His sophisticated analyses and sometimes controversial positions continue to provoke thought and debate, challenging us to reconsider our approaches to persistent social problems.\nIn revisiting these articles, we gain not only a deeper understanding of a critical period in African American history but also valuable insights into the ongoing struggle for equality and justice. Du Bois’s legacy, as reflected in these pages, continues to inspire and challenge us, urging us to confront the complexities of race and power with the same intellectual rigor and moral conviction that he brought to the pages of The Crisis."

    "text": "This anthology is an ongoing effort to make available a selection of works by W.E.B. Du Bois that appeared in The Crisis, the official journal of the NAACP. Du Bois founded the journal in 1910 and regularly contributed editorials and occasional articles between 1910 and 1934 when he left the NAACP over conflicting views on segregated institutions.\nIn addition to his many other commitments during this period, his writing for The Crisis was prolific, frequently writing multiple items for each of the 286 issues he edited. The content of his pieces varied widely, from short items recognizing developments at Black colleges or Y.W.C.A chapters, to fiery denunciations of Southern Jim Crow laws, to long essays on the relationship between capitalism and racism. This volume attempts to represent the full diversity of his writing during this period, particularly those pieces that engage in analysis.\nAlthough he published his own articles every year or so, Du Bois’s main contribution to the writing of The Crisis was his editorials. Early editorials in The Crisis are unsigned, although historians and biographers attribute most to Du Bois, except those appearing under the name of another NAACP official or when it was noted in the pages that Du Bois was traveling during the production of the issues. These usually appeared near the back, after an “Opinion” section composed of extracts from Black newspapers. In 1921, The Crisis switched from publishing “Editorials” to an “Opinion” column credit to Du Bois, and it was usually the first section in each issue. Finally, in the late 1920s, his section was renamed “Postscript” and moved to the back pages.\nAs one of the major goals of the journal was to document white racism, Du Bois did not shy away from printing offensive language and images of racial violence that were designed to shock and disgust readers. They remain shocking and disgusting 100 years on.\n The title of this volume, Dare Your Fight?, comes from a 1914 editorial Join or Die, which provides a rationale for the journal and an emotional plea to support it and the NAACP:\n\nThe Crisis entertains and informs its readers for the one object and the sole object of arousing their fighting blood. The Crisis means fight and fight for Right.\n\nThe entire run of The Crisis is available at the Internet Archive. We review each issue to identify relevant pieces, and then copy, clean and format the text to match the version found in the PDF. Each cleaned article is saved in markdown format and is available on the project’s GitHub site. Please consider making more articles available by contributing your effort to the project.\nThe versions of his work published here largely reflect how they appeared when originally published. For example, the hyphen in “to-day” is reproduced. Only a few consistent changes have been made:\n\nParagraph-long quotes are indented.\nWhile early articles began with a drop cap, and the first few words were capitalized in many pieces, those have not been reproduced here.\nA few typographical conventions have been modernized, such as placing punctuation within the quotation,\nOne or two spelling errors are corrected.\n\nFinally, while this project emphasizes the writing of W.E.B. Du Bois, The Crisis was much bigger than that. There are politics, community updates, lists of college graduates, poetry, fiction, and art. Where else will you stumble across Langston Hughes coming in second in a reader-submitted poetry contest? Every author’s name provides an opportunity to go down a rabbit hole exploring a new facet of early twentieth-century Black culture. But Du Bois must have realized that what his readers wanted most was baby pictures. Adorable grins appear in just about every issue. There is likely no larger archive of African American infant portraiture than the pages of The Crisis.\nThe website is produced using Quarto.\nNeal Caren"

    "section": "",
    "text": "W.E.B. Du Bois, the influential sociologist and civil rights activist, founded The Crisis, the official journal of the NAACP, in 1910. From the journal’s start until 1934, Du Bois regularly contributed editorials and articles that shaped the discourse around race relations and Black identity in America during the early 20th century. His writings from this period also provide invaluable insights into the evolution of his thinking and activism during these critical decades.\nThis project aims to digitize and make available Du Bois’s writings from his 24-year tenure at The Crisis, which are estimated to be well over 1,000 articles and editorials. Currently, the site includes more than 600 of his contributions, with hundreds more awaiting digitization in The Crisis archives. By making these works accessible in a digital format, we hope to facilitate new scholarship and engagement with Du Bois’s work during this period.\nIf you are interested in helping expand access to Du Bois’s work, please review our Contribution Guide for details on how you can get involved in the digitization effort. The guide outlines the process for transcribing, proofreading, and uploading articles to the database. You can also email the project director, Neal Caren, with any questions or to discuss other ways you would like to contribute to the project.\nOur goal is to create a searchable database of Du Bois’s writings from The Crisis. This resource will serve as an invaluable tool for scholars, students, and activists, and foster new conversations around Du Bois’s enduring legacy."

Historically, lynching leads to lynching, burning to burning; and lynching for great crimes to lynching for trivial offenses. Moreover, lynching as practised today in the Uited States is not the result of crime—it is a cause of crime, on account of the flagrant, awful injustice it inflicts in so many cases on innocent men. Take, for instance, the story of the lynching in Florida, as told by Governor Gilchrist. He says, in answer to a correspondent:\n\nAs to the “black brute who received his deserts,” I would state that I examined the evidence in this case. A certain man. accompanied by three others—all white—drove from a quarter to a half mile from the main road through the place of an old Negro, using an old road. This old Negro had five sons and sons-in-law living in his immediate vicinity. That morning there had been some lawsuit with one of these Negroes, the case having been tried at Mickosukie. The Negroes had returned to their home. This certain man and party drove through the old Negro’s place. The old Negro opened the gate so they could drive through his place, going toward the public road. This certain man and the others got out of their buggies and returned to the gate. This man had a pistol in his hand, and commenced talking to the old darkey, more or less threatening him. All the evidence shows, and what I have heard of him, through white people, shows that he was a harmless old darkey. The old Negro ran. Shots were fired at him. Knowing there had been a lawsuit that day, and doubtless seeing this man and party driving through the field, this old Negro’s sons and sons-in-law, on hearing the report of shots, naturally came to his house. The old Negro had a son who was sick and lying—my recollection is—on the porch. This man was talking to the sick son in front of the porch with his pistol in his hand, raising his arm up and down apparently as though he was going to shoot him. It appears, however, that it was probably not the intention of this man to shoot this darkey. In running up to the house, one of the old man’s sons or sons-in-law, seeing this man with the pistol in his hand, and his arm up, shot this man in the side under the arm. He died instantly. This occurred within a few feet of the cabin of the old Negro. The old Negro and his five sons and sons-in-law were taken to jail and were sent to Lake City for safe keeping. A party of lynchers, with a forged telegram from the Governor, secured the Negroes from the jail under pretext of taking them to Jacksonville, claiming they were protecting them from a lynching party. The Negroes were bound, taken out on the edge of the town and shot to death.\n\nWhat now must be the feeling of the Negroes thereabouts? Are they appalled at their own wickedness? Do they see that the wages of sin is death? Not they. They despise the white man’s justice, hate him, and whenever they hear of Negro “crime” in the future they will say: “It’s a white man’s lie.”\nNot only this, but these people know how criminals are made and they pity rather than condemn them. Take, for instance, the cries throughout the South against “vagrants.” It means the call for the State enslavement of any man who does not work for a white man at the white man’s price. The most outrageous laws and arrests are made under the excuse of vagrancy. In Atlanta, on October 15, thirty-seven laborers were arrested at night in their lodging house as “vagrants.” In Texas five laborers were arrested as vagrants and proved their hard, steady jobs. “But,” remarks the Galveston Tribune chirpily:\n\nThe State chose to prosecute under a different portion of the law, alleging loitering about houses of ill-fame. The court explained, as he has done before, that a person can be a vagrant yet be steadily employed, the law being general in its effect and covering many points upon which a conviction can be had on a charge of vagrancy.\n\nSuppose now a mischievous boy or a loiterer or a laborer out of work is thrown into jail as a vagrant, what happens to him?\nFrom a thousand examples, let us choose but one from a Texas report on a local “chain gang”:\n\nThe day’s program was invariably this: Up at 4:30 o’clock in the morning, trot two to five miles to the cane fields, work there in squads until noon, when fifteen to twenty minutes would be allowed for the eating of a cold dinner; driven hard during the afternoon and brought back by starlight at night in the same dog trot they went out in the morning. The weak must keep up with the strong in his work or be punished. Convicts slept in their underclothes or naked, as it happened to rain or shine during the day. If it rained they hung up their clothes to dry’ and slept without. One convict testified that he had frequently taken his clothes from the nail frozen stiff. One man was on a farm a year, and during that time the bedclothes were not washed and were sunned but twice.\n\nThus desperate criminals are manufactured and turned out day by day.\nCan we stop this by lynching? No. The first step toward stopping crime is to stop lynching. The next step is to treat black men like human beings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLynching (1927)\nLynching (1914)\nLynching (1926)\nLynching (1928)\nCauses of Lynching (1931)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Crime and Lynching.”\nThe Crisis 3 (3): 113–14. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/03/crime_and_lynching.html."

    "text": "The greatest concession wrung from an arrogant modern nation by a dark-skinned people has just been gained by the Indians from the English. The Durbar was not simply a ceremonial—it was a concession. For a long time England has been trying to conciliate India by social deference to her princes. Few of the great drawing rooms of London have not been graced in recent years by these Eastern potentates, and every public honor has been shown them. All this is an old method with rulers. Even with the American Negro the experiment is continually tried locally and nationally of extravagantly honoring leaders who can be depended on to do the tyrant’s will unquestioningly.\nThe rank and file, however, soon learn to discriminate between such empty honors and the real good of the people. Ground down by ignorance and poverty, India demands education and political autonomy. Oppressed by color prejudice they demand the treatment of men.\nThe Durbar brought concessions in all these lines. Its political significance lay in the actual crowning of an English monarch in India. No longer is George V a foreign monarch ruling this land beyond the sea—he is an emperor crowned on Indian soil; moreover, his capital will be hereafter the ancient Indian capital of Delhi, and not the more English Calcutta, where a fierce native agitation has opened the eyes of England to the determination of young India to be free.\nThe Durbar marked the establishment of the first great fund for popular education in India, and finally it brought one curious concession, a concession which England must have been almost ashamed to announce: hereafter the Victoria Cross for bravery on the field of battle will be given to brown men as well as white! Thus ends a discrimination almost as disgraceful as the discrimination against colored candidates for Rhodes scholarships in the Southern United States.\nHow have these concessions been secured? By agitation—persistent and long-continued agitation, by unrest and protest which is not yet satisfied, and will not be until India is a free autonomous nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nIndia (1930)\nGandhi and India (1921)\nEgypt and India (1919)\nThe Freeing of India (1947)\nWest Indian Immigration (1924)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “The Durbar.” The Crisis 3\n(4): 156. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/04/durbar.html."

    "text": "We would like to know what rights the white people of this land are going to be able to retain? Step by step their dearest and most cherished prerogatives are being invaded, and The Crisis wants to say right here and now that it does not countenance oppression of the downtrodden whites by arrogant black folk. A few years ago the right to kick a darky off the sidewalk was unquestioned in the most devout circles, and yet to-day they actually complain at being called by their front names.\nEverybody knows that for three hundred years the most jealously guarded right of white men in this land and others has been the right to seduce black women without legal, social or moral penalty. Many white mothers and daughters of the best families have helped to maintain this ancient and honored custom by loading the victims of their fathers’ and husbands’ lust with every epithet of insult and degradation. Thus has the sweet cleanness of their own race virtue shone holier and higher.\nYet what do we see to-day? The black husbands and brothers are beginning to revolt. In three separate cases, in three consecutive months and in three localities of the southern South have these blind and ignorant fellows actually killed white men who were demanding these ancient rights, and have compelled the chivalry of the land to rise and lynch the black defenders of defenceless virtue; also two strangely illogical black women have been simultaneously killed and a dark and whimpering little girl burned to a quivering crisp.\nWhat does all this mean? Does it portend an unthinkable time when the white man can only get his rights by lynching impudent black husbands and squeamish sweethearts? If so, then, by the Great Jehovah, we can depend on the best friends of the Negro to vindicate the ancient liberties of this land! Anglo-Saxon freedom seems safe at least in the hands of most leaders of Southern society, not to mention the blue blood of Pennsylvania.\nMeantime, dear colored brethren, we confess to the error of our ways. We have steadfastly opposed lynching on all occasions, but the South is converting us. We acknowledge our fault. Hereafter we humbly pray that every man, black or white, who is anxious to defend women, will be willing to be lynched for his faith. Let black men especially kill lecherous white invaders of their homes and then take their lynching gladly like men.\nIt’s worth it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHeroes (1919)\nThe Social Equality of Whites and Blacks (1920)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nThirteen (1918)\nAgain, Social Equality (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Divine Right.” The Crisis 3\n(5): 197. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/05/divine_right.html."

    "text": "In a recent review of Mr. Thomas Nelson Page’s life of Robert E. Lee in the New York Times we find the following sentence: “Of all the figures in history, it is he (Lee) who most nearly approaches Washington; in fact, there is little or nothing to choose between them except the fact that Lee failed.”\nThis statement is worth noting because it expresses a sentiment not uncommon to-day. Here are two gen­erals, both well born, scrupulously honorable, brave and efficient. The only difference between them is that one was victorious, while the other was obliged in the end to surrender. One won, the other lost; that is all.\nIn Memorial Hall, at Harvard University, are the names of the college graduates who fell in battle for the cause of the Union. Again and again has come the demand that with these names there be placed the names of the graduates who fell defending the Confederacy. Both were brave youths, the argument goes, both fought unselfishly. Why not give honor to both, since they only differed in that one lost and the other won in battle?\nNow, what is the significance of this doctrine which many Americans believe should be preached in literature and history and on the walls of a noble building erected in memory of the heroic dead? This, that if the youths who go forth into the world, fight honorably; if they bear defeat bravely, it makes no difference what side they take in the battle. They may fight for the right of the individual to control the natural resources of the earth, to destroy the forests, to impoverish the land, or they may fight for the conservation of such resources; no matter, so that they fight well. Like Washington, their choice may be to lead the army of republicanism, or like Lee, they may choose to lead the aristocracy to battle for the right of one man to hold another as his chattel; the wisdom of their choice is of no importance; “there is little or nothing to choose between the two;” both are singularly alike, both are worthy of equal praise.\nAt this time of year, when we celebrate the birthdays of our two most famous Americans, let us denounce this philosophy in no uncertain terms. The choice that a man makes is his life. The present crisis faces every youthful spirit, and life for him is a failure or a success as he chooses “the good or evil side;” the side of spiritual, human progress, or the side of material, brutal enslavement. No sentiment can keep alive for long the names of those, however honorable, who chose to fight with the forces of darkness. If they live, they live in opprobrium. Washington lives and Lincoln lives because each, at The Crisis of his life, chose the side of progress and civilization. Lincoln saw the “irrepressible conflict” and stood for freedom; otherwise he would be as great a nonentity as his rival, Stephen A. Douglas. Washington lives because he believed that taxation without representation was tyranny; otherwise he would have been forgotten like—but who remembers the name of one of the gentlemen who drew their swords for King George?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRobert E.

    "text": "The convict guard laughed.\n“I don’t know,” he said, “I hadn’t thought of that——”\nHe hesitated and looked at the stranger curiously. In the solemn twilight he got an impression of unusual height and soft dark eyes.\n“Curious sort of acquaintance for the Colonel,” he thought; then he continued aloud: “But that nigger there is bad; a born thief and ought to be sent up for life; is practically; got ten years last time——”\nHere the voice of the promoter talking within interrupted; he was bending over his figures, sitting by the Colonel. He was slight, with a sharp nose.\n“The convicts,” he said, “would cost us $96 a year and board. Well, we can squeeze that so that it won’t be over $125 apiece. Now, if these fellows are driven, they can build this line within twelve months. It will be running next April. Freights will fall fifty per cent. Why, man, you will be a millionaire in less than ten years.”\nThe Colonel started. He was a thick, short man, with clean-shaven face, and a certain air of breeding about the lines of his countenance; the wordmillionaire sounded well in his ears. He thought—he thought a great deal; he almost heard the puff of the fearfully costly automobile that was coming up the road, and he said:\n“I suppose we might as well hire them.”\n“Of course,” answered the promoter.\nThe voice of the tall stranger in the corner broke in here:\n“It will be a good thing for them?” he said, half in question.\nThe Colonel moved. “The guard makes strange friends,” he thought to himself. “What’s this man doing here, anyway?” He looked at him, or rather, looked at his eyes, and then somehow felt a warming toward him. He said:\n“Well, at least it can’t harm them—they’re beyond that.”\n“It will do them good, then,” said the stranger again. The promoter shrugged his shoulders.\n“It will do us good,” he said.\nBut the Colonel shook his head impatiently. He felt a desire to justify himself before those eyes, and he answered: “Yes, it will do them good; or, at any rate, it won’t make them any worse than they are.”\nThen he started to say something else, but here sure enough the sound of the automobile breathing at the gate stopped him and they all arose.\n“It is settled, then,” said the promoter. “Yes,” said the Colonel, signing his name and turning toward the stranger again.\n“Are you going into town?” he asked with the Southern courtesy of white man to white man in a country town. The stranger said he was.\n“Then come along in my machine. I want to talk to you about this.”\nThey went out to the car. The stranger as he went turned again to look back at the convict. He was a tall, powerfully built black fellow. His face was sullen, with a low forehead, thick, hanging lips, and bitter eyes. There was revolt written about the mouth, and a hangdog expression. He stood bending over his pile of stones pounding listlessly.\nBeside him stood a boy of twelve, yellow, with a hunted, crafty look. The convict raised his eyes, and they met the eyes of the stranger. The hammer fell from his hands.\nThe stranger turned slowly toward the automobile, and the Colonel introduced him. He could not exactly catch the foreign-sounding name, but he mumbled something as he presented him to his wife and little girl, who were waiting. As they whirled away he started to talk, but the stranger had taken the little girl into his lap, and together they conversed in low tones all the way home.\nIn some way, they did not exactly know how, they got the impression that the man was a teacher, and of course he must be a foreigner. The long cloak-like coat told this. They rode in the twilight through the half-lighted town, and at last drew up before the Colonel’s mansion, with its ghostlike pillars.\nThe lady in the back seat was thinking of the guests she had invited to dinner, and wondered if she ought not to ask this man to stay. He seemed cultured, and she supposed he was some acquaintance of the Colonel’s. It would be rather a distinction to have him there, with the Judge’s wife and daughter and the Rector. She spoke almost before she thought:\n“You will enter and rest awhile?” The Colonel and the little girl insisted. For a moment the stranger seemed about to refuse. He said he was on his way North, where he had some business for his father in Pennsylvania. Then, for the child’s sake, he consented. Up the steps they went, and into the dark parlor, and there they sat and talked a long time. It was a curious conversation. Afterward they did not remember exactly what was said, and yet they all remembered a certain strange satisfaction in that long talk.\nPresently the nurse came for the reluctant child, and the hostess bethought herself:\n“We will have a cup of tea—you will be dry and tired.”\nShe rang and switched on a blaze of light. With one accord they all looked at the stranger, for they had hardly seen him well in the glooming twilight. The woman started in amazement and the Colonel half rose in anger. Why, the man was a mulatto, surely—even if he did not own the Negro blood, their practised eyes knew it. He was tall and straight, and the coat looked like a Jewish gabardine. His hair hung in close curls far down the sides of his face, and his face was olive, even yellow.\nA peremptory order rose to the Colonel’s lips, and froze there as he caught the stranger’s eyes. Those eyes, where had he seen those eyes before? He remembered them long years ago—the soft tear-filled eyes of a brown girl. He remembered many things, and his face grew drawn and white. Those eyes kept burning into him, even when they were turned half away toward the staircase, where the white figure of the child hovered with her nurse, and waved goodnight. The lady sank into her chair and thought: “What will the Judge’s wife say? How did the Colonel come to invite this man here? How shall we be rid of him?” She looked at the Colonel in reproachful consternation.\nJust then the door opened and the old butler came in. He was an ancient black man with tufted white hair, and he held before him a large silver tray filled with a china tea service. The stranger rose slowly and stretched forth his hands as if to bless the viands. The old man paused in bewilderment, tottered and then, with sudden gladness in his eyes, dropped to his knees as the tray crashed to the floor.\n“My Lord!” he whispered, “and My God!” But the woman screamed: “Mother’s china!”\nThe doorbell rang.\n“Heavens! Here is the dinner party!” exclaimed the lady.\nShe turned toward the door, but there in the hall, clad in her night clothes, was the little girl. She had stolen down the stairs to see the stranger again, and the nurse above was calling in vain. The woman felt hysterical and scolded at the nurse, but the stranger had stretched out his arms, and with a glad cry the child nestled in them. “Of such,” he whispered, “is the Kingdom of Heaven,” as he slowly mounted the stairs with his little burden.\nThe mother was glad; anything to be rid of the interloper even for a moment. The bell rang again, and she hastened toward the door, which the loitering black maid was just opening. She did not notice the shadow of the stranger as he came slowly down the stairs and paused by the newel post, dark and silent.\nThe Judge’s wife entered. She was an old woman, frilled and powdered into a caricature of youth, and gorgeously gowned. She came forward, smiling with extended hands, but just as she was opposite the stranger, a chill from somewhere seemed to strike her, and she shuddered and cried: “What a draft!” as she drew a silken shawl about her and shook hands cordially; she forgot to ask who the stranger was. The Judge strode in unseeing, thinking of a puzzling case of theft.\n“Eh? What? Oh—er—yes—good-evening,” he said, “good-evening.”\nBehind them came a young woman in the glory of youth, daintily silked, with diamonds around her fair neck, beautiful in face and form. She came in lightly, but stopped with a little gasp; then she laughed gaily and said:\n“Why, I beg your pardon. Was it not curious? I thought I saw there behind your man”—she hesitated (“but he must be a servant,” she argued)—“the shadow of wide white wings. It was but the light on the drapery. What a turn it gave me—so glad to be here!” And she smiled again. With her came a tall and haughty naval officer. Hearing his lady refer to the servant, he hardly looked at him, but held his gilded cap and cloak carelessly toward him; the stranger took them and placed them carefully on the rack.\nLast came the Rector, a man of forty, and well clothed. He started to pass the stranger, stopped and looked at him inquiringly.\n“I beg your pardon,” he said, “I beg your pardon, I think I have met you?”\nThe stranger made no answer, and the hostess nervously hurried the guests on. But the Rector lingered and looked perplexed.\n“Surely I know you; I have met you somewhere,” he said, putting his hand vaguely to his head. “You—you remember me, do you not?”\nThe stranger quietly swept his cloak aside, and to the hostess’ unspeakable relief moved toward the door.\n“I never knew you,” he said in low tones, as he went.\nThe lady murmured some faint excuse about intruders, but the Rector stood with annoyance written on his face.\n“I beg a thousand pardons,” he said to the hostess absently. “It is a great pleasure to be here—somehow I thought I knew that man. I am sure I knew him, once.”\nThe stranger had passed down the steps, and as he went the nurse-maid, lingering at the top of the staircase, flew down after him, caught his cloak, trembled, hesitated, and then kneeled in the dust. He touched her lightly with his hand and said, “Go, and sin no more.”\nWith a glad cry the maid left the house with its open door and turned north, running, while the stranger turned eastward to the night. As they parted a long low howl rose tremulously and reverberated through the town. The Colonel’s wife within shuddered.\n“The bloodhounds,” she said. The Rector answered carelessly.\n“Another one of those convicts escaped, I suppose; really, they need severer measures.” Then he stopped. He was trying to remember that stranger’s name. The Judge’s wife looked about for the draft and arranged her shawl. The girl glanced at the white drapery in the hall, but the young officer was bending over her, and the fires of life burned in her veins.\nHowl after howl rose in the night, swelled and died away. The stranger strode rapidly along the highway and out into the deep forest. There he paused and stood waiting, tall and still. A mile up the road behind him a man was running, tall and powerful and black, with crime-stained face, with convict’s stripes upon him and shackles on his legs. He ran and jumped in little short steps, and the chains rang. He fell and rose again, while the howl of the hounds rung harder behind him.\nInto the forest he leaped and crept and jumped and ran, streaming with sweat; seeing the tall form rise before him, he stopped suddenly, dropped his hands in sullen impotence and sank panting to the earth. A bloodhound shot into the woods behind him, howled, whined and fawned before the stranger’s’ feet. Hound after hound bayed, leapt and lay there; then silent, one by one, with bowed head, they crept backward toward the town.\nThe stranger made a cup of his hands and gave the man water to drink, bathed his hot head, and gently took the chains and irons from his feet. By and by the convict stood up. Day was dawning above the treetops. He looked into the stranger’s face, and for a moment a gladness swept over the stains of his face.\n“Why, you’se a nigger, too,” he said.\nThen the convict seemed anxious to justify himself.\n“I never had no chance,” he said furtively.\n“Thou §halt not steal,” said the stranger.\nThe man bridled.\n“But how about them? Can they steal? Didn’t they steal a whole year’s work and then, when I stole to keep from starving—-” he glanced at the stranger. “No, I didn’t steal just to keep from starving. I stole to be stealing. I can’t help stealing. Seems like when I sees things I just must—but, yes, I’ll try!” The convict looked down at his striped clothes, but the stranger had taken off his long coat and put it around him, and the stripes disappeared. In the opening morning the black man started toward the low log farmhouse in the distance, and the stranger stood watching him. There was a new glory in the day. The black man’s face cleared up and the farmer was glad to get him.\nAll day he worked as he had never worked before, and the farmer gave him some cold food toward night.\n“You can sleep in the barn,” he said, and turned away.\n“How much do I git a day?” asked the man.\nThe farmer scowled:\n“If you’ll sign a contract for the season,” he said, “I’ll give you ten dollars a month.”\n“I won’t sign no contract to be a slave,” said the man doggedly.\n“Yes, you will,” said the farmer, threateningly, “or I’ll call the convict guard.” And he grinned.\nThe convict shrunk and slouched to the barn. As night fell he looked out and saw the farmer leave the place. Slowly he crept out and sneaked toward the house. He looked into the kitchen door. No one was there, but the supper was spread as if the mistress had laid it and gone out. He ate ravenously. Then he looked into the front room and listened. He could hear low voices on the porch. On the table lay a silver watch. He gazed at it, and in a moment was beside it, with his hand on it. Quickly he slipped out of the house and slouched toward the field. He saw his employer coming along the highway. He fled hack stealthily and around to the front of the house, when suddenly he stopped. He felt the great dark eyes of the stranger and saw the same dark, cloak-like coat, where he was seated on the doorstep talking with the mistress of the house. Slowly, guiltily, he turned back, entered the kitchen and laid the watch where he had found it; and then he rushed wildly with arms outstretched back toward the stranger.\nThe woman had laid supper for her husband, and going down from the house had walked out toward a neighbor’s. She was gone but a little while, and when she came back she started to see a dark figure on the doorsteps under the tall red oak. She thought it was the new Negro hand until he said in a soft voice: “Will you give me bread?”\nReassured at the voice of a white man, she answered quickly in her soft Southern tones:\n“Why, certainly.”\nShe was a little woman. Once she had been handsome, but now her face was drawn with work and care. She was nervous, and was always thinking, wishing, wanting for something. She went in and got him some cornbread and a glass of cool, rich buttermilk, and then came out and sat down beside him. She began, quite unconsciously, to tell him about herself—the things she had done, and had not done, and the things she had wished. She told him of her husband, and this new farm they were trying to buy. She said it was so hard to get niggers to work. She said they ought all to be in the chain gang and made to work. Even then some ran away. Only yesterday one had escaped.\nAt last she gossiped of her neighbors; how good they were and how bad.\n“And do you like them all?” asked the stranger.\nShe hesitated.\n“Most of them,” she said; and then, looking up into his face and putting her hand in his as though he were her father, she said:\n“There are none I hate; no, none at all.”\nHe looked away and said dreamily:\n“You love your neighbor as yourself?”\nShe hesitated—\n“I try——” she began, and then looked the way he was looking; down under the hill, where lay a little, half-ruined cabin.\n“They are niggers,” she said briefly.\nHe looked at her. Suddenly a confusion came over her, and she insisted, she knew not why—\n“But they are niggers.”\nWith a sudden impulse she rose, and hurriedly lighted the lamp that stood just within the door and held it above her head. She saw his dark face and curly hair. She shrieked in angry terror, and rushed down the path; and just as she rushed down, the black convict came running up with hands outstretched. They met in midpath, and before he could stop he had run against her, and she fell heavily to earth and lay white and still. Her husband came rushing up with cry and oath:\n“I knew it,” he said; “it is that runaway nigger.” He held the black man struggling to the earth, and raised his voice to a yell. Down the highway came the convict guard with hound and mob and gun. They poured across the fields. The farmer motioned to them.\n“He—attacked—my wife,” he gasped.\nThe mob snarled and worked silently. Right to the limb of the red oak they hoisted the struggling, writhing black man, while others lifted the dazed woman. Right and left as she tottered to the house she searched for the stranger, with a sick yearning, but the stranger was gone. And she told none of her guest.\n“No—no—I want nothing,” she insisted, until they left her, as they thought, asleep. For a time she lay still listening to the departure of the mob. Then she rose. She shuddered as she heard the creaking of the limb where the body hung. But resolutely she crawled to the window and peered out into the moonlight; she saw the dead man writhe. He stretched his arms out like a cross, looking upward. She gasped and clung to the window sill. Behind the swaying body, and down where the little, half-ruined cabin lay, a single flame flashed up amid the far-off shout and cry of the mob. A fierce joy sobbed up through the terror in her soul and then sank abashed as she watched the flame rise. Suddenly whirling into one great crimson column it shot to the top of the sky and threw great arms athwart the gloom until above the world and behind the roped and swaying form below hung quivering and burning a great crimson cross.\nShe hid her dizzy, aching head in an agony of tears, ana dared not look, for she knew. Her dry lips moved: “Despised and rejected of men.”\nShe knew, and the very horror of it lifted her dull and shrinking eyelids. There, heaven-tall, earth-wide, hung the stranger on the crimson cross, riven and bloodstained with thorn-crowned head and pierced hands. She stretched her arms and shrieked.\nHe did not hear. He did not see. His calm dark eyes all sorrowful were fastened on the writhing, twisting body of the thief, and a voice came out of the winds of the night, saying:\n“This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCourts and Jails (1932)\nAgain, Social Equality (1920)\nFor What (1919)\nThe Old Story (1911)\nA Soldier (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Jesus Christ in Georgia.”\nThe Crisis 3 (2): 70–74. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/02/jesus_christ.html."

Is it because of Turkish misrule? No, Europe has been able to stand that a thousand years. No, but as soon as the revolution and uplift came—as soon as the young Turks and the whole Mohammedan world showed signs of regeneration—then it was that the professed followers of the meek and lowly Jesus became shameless highwaymen. Austria seized one juicy bit; Montenegro put her hand on another, but found it too hot. Whereupon her ruler’s son-in-law, King of Italy, saw a divine mission. He saw a chance to distract Italians from their own parlous condition by a debauch of conquest. The Jingo yelled, the soldier burnished his tinsel, and the Church, which no Italian blandishments of peace had been able to subdue, hastened to put its divine blessing on murder.

We simply pause to acknowledge our indebtedness to Miss Pratt and Miss Ovington and to recommend our readers to know the former’s stories and to commit to memory the last chapter of “Half-a-Man.”\n“Ezekielism” is the assumption that the faults of any particular individual are the innate faults of his group and that any virtues he may possess are peculiar to him and quite exceptional so far as his group are concerned.\n“Racial” faults and “exceptional” virtues are the rock foundation of “Ezekielism.” The person who proposes to “Ezekielize” begins invariably with a phrase. “Now I have no prejudice.” By this phrase ye shall know them—“I have no prejudice—BUT.” That is the main statement and the ending is immaterial. It may be any one of these or a dozen others:\n\nI know a Negro who steals.\nI know a Jew who cheats.\nI know an Italian “black hander.”\nI know a woman who is frivolous.\nI know a white man who led a mob.\n\nAfter that persons afflicted with this form of hysteria proceed to “Ezekielize” and, lo! we learn that:\n\nNegroes steal.\nJews cheat.\nItalians murder.\nIrishmen drink.\nWomen are silly.\nWhite folk lynch.\n\nYou may expostulate: “But I know one Negro——”\n“Exception,” whispers your friend and the “Ezekielism” is complete.\nNow, such travesty on logic cannot be used on all races with impunity, because some races have sense enough to fight back. When a New York chief of police ventured to charge Jews with a large share of the crime of the city he lost his job. When Louisiana took to lynching Italians the United States Government paid a tidy sum; Boston and New York used to find no words too contemptuous for Irishmen, but the Lord or somebody else has touched their hearts recently; and so forth.\nTo-day it is only the Negro who is the unquestionable victim of “Ezekielism.” I approach a school principal with my child, along with a dozen other races. To the Italian, the Jew, the Irishman, the Yankee, he says: “How is Mabel? What of Bridget’s arithmetic? Is Miriam strong? Can Assunta spell?” But, looking my child over, he says, reflectively: “Negroes have never done well in this school.” I do not remind him that the school has had but two solitary little black waifs in twenty years. I do not lose my temper, for victims of “Ezekielism” are not responsible and one must allow for them. So I sigh and remark: “Indeed!”\nOr I present to a philanthropist the case of a decent woman who is refused food at Shanley’s or Childs’ or some other restaurant. He looks at me disapprovingly and says, shaking a fat finger:\n“I’ve been trying to get a cook——”\nThen I know that he has a case of “Ezekielism” and I go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nFor What (1919)\nThe Crisis (1910)\nCurtains of Pain (1917)\nCounsels of Despair (1934)\nBrowsing Reader - The American Race Problem (1927)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “‘Ezekielism’.”\nThe Crisis 3 (1): 25. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/01/ezekielism.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are with great assiduity collecting practical definitions of “social equality.”We say “practical” because the theoretical argument has gone quite insane. Here comes this month, The Missionary Voice, a well-disposed organ of the Southern white Methodists. In reviewing a pamphlet published by Atlanta University the Voice remarks concerning the editor that he is “well known as the leader of those Negroes who desire social equality for their race—a desire which crops out, here and there, through this pamphlet. The fact that no Southern white nor the wisest Southern blacks would sanction this desire for one moment does not lessen the impressiveness of this study of Negro effort to uplift the Negro race.”\nHere we have a faint clue as to what the South means by “social equality” with black folk. The pamphlet in question is entitled “Efforts for Social Betterment Among Negro Americans.” It treats of the charity of church and school, of women’s clubs, homes, orphanages and hospitals, nurseries, settlements, etc. This does not look dangerous. Just where social equality “crops out” here it is hard to say, unless the South means by this phrase every effort of black men to be treated like other men.\nAnd this is what the South does mean. Because it means this it plunges into either contradiction or helplessness when Southern religion strikes the color line. In this same magazine, for instance, there occurs the following passage:\n\nThe Methodist Episcopal Church, South, is doing very little directly for the Southern Negro socially, educationally or religiously. The Board of Education appropriates $14,000 annually to the schools of the colored Methodist Episcopal Church, but the only Southern white Methodists that have any personal relation to any of these schools are three teachers in Paine College. Educationally the Negro needs the personal touch of the Christian white man. If we want to do “social service,” no better place to begin can be found than among the Negroes in our towns and cities.\n\nDoes not the Missionary Voice recognize that there can be no true “social service” or “personal touch” without “social equality?” Was it not the fact that Jesus Christ became the social equal of publicans, sinners and prostitutes that made Him the Great Teacher? How much more is social equality with honest laborers who are striving upward absolutely necessary for those who would really uplift? This is the whole movement of the age, and the South is whirling in a back eddy, damming progress and trying at once to avoid hypocrisy and yet teach the black at arm’s length with a club in one hand and a Bible in the other.\nThis Missionary Voice is the voice of earnest, honest people. They are striving toward the light, but they have not reached it, and they are consequently illogical. The only logical folk in the South to-day are the Vardamans and Tillmans. They hold no illusions and know that you cannot treat a man as a man and as a beast at the same time. Therefore, they argue, treat Negroes as beasts. When will logic come to the better South and enable it to arise and say: “I dare despise nothing human. I am not better than my black neighbor.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSocial Equality (1916)\nSuffrage (1920)\nSocial Equality (1919)\nLight (1912)\n‘Social Equality’ (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “‘Social Equality’.”\nThe Crisis 3 (1): 25. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/03/01/social_equality.html."

    "text": "It is just south of Manassas where Beauregard had his supplies, and east of the first two battlefields, with their ghastly relics and calm and guardian mountains.\nThis third battlefield is dotted with buildings green and red. A little flying engine pants continuously with its water burden, and to and fro pass dark graceful girls and sturdy brown-faced boys. There are green lawns and little trees, and westward in a hidden grotto, a grove green golden, echoing with the voices of new graduates long gone. The dull crimson building in the midst—Howland Hall—stands sturdily with a certain quietude, flinging a long, low wing modestly behind it, where sprites and gnomes and fairies dart in and out and to and fro in busy work.\nSouthward the girls are clustered, northward the boys, and round about are teachers’ families often new founded with new and cunning babies, albeit one and the prettiest had fled, suddenly, and left a sorrow underneath the trees. Teachers there are, varicolored, sunny and sad, but quiet all, busy and happy, eager and glad. With them and not above them is the principal with his boy face and his wife who has wings—wings finely frayed with beating at the bars of life—but wings withal, and in her eyes dreams.\nBut the battle? Ah, yes, the battle, the third and blood-bought battle of this winding brook that whimpers ’twixt the mountains and the sea; the blood of wounded souls lies along the gold green of that campus—the hail of the iron that enters thuds through the thick dark skins. Now and then the bitter stifled wail of the dying breaks the sudden stillness, then the ranks close and the school moves on.\nIt’s costly, this fighting. Costly in blood and men, costly in money, costliest in worry and apprehension. Each year, each month, the Forager goes North:\n“A man to see you, sir.”\n“Who?” snorts Wall Street, wheeling in his chair.\n“Colored man—begging, I think, sir.”\n“Another Nigger school! Give him $5 and send him on.”\nAnd the Forager pockets his shame and moves wearily to the West.\n“Yes? Well, I’m giving so much to colored people already—what is this school?”\n“Manassas Industrial School? Yes. And for colored youth? Yes? I never heard of it. I give to things I hear of—Battle? I thought the war was over; it isn’t. How sad. Good-day.”\nThus in drippings of the rich and pennies of the poor each year $18,000 is raised to dig the trench and fire the fuse and strengthen the soul in this third struggle at Manassas.\nWho is fighting? North and South, black and white, rich and poor? Oh, no—more primal, more stupendous is this struggle of worlds; light and leading and industry against darkness and hate and the Devil-of-things-that-be. And who wins? God wins—or is ever about to win, if only the Forager staggers home with the food to feed the weary watchers in the trenches, the black-sweated fighters in the fields. Pity the Forager, my brothers, and hold up his hands!\nSunset on the battlefield, and the hard breathing of them that rest from their labors; to the West, glory; to the East, the moon; between, shadows of things that were and are to be; around, a rose-grown porch, the patter of little feet, Woman—with—wings, Man—who—is—ever-young, and laughter.\nUp from the earth come voices, heavy with sorrow:\n\nO brother you must bow so low,\n \nO brother you must bow so low,  \nFor long is the way to the ever bright world,  \nLet the Heaven light shine on me!\n\nAnd so on till we sleep; in our ears the soft low panting of the engine catching its breath; in our eyes the everlasting stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAttention (1918)\nTo the Rescue (1916)\nThe South (1917)\nGirls (1921)\nThe Drama Among Black Folk (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “The Third Battle of Bull Run.”\nThe Crisis 4 (3): 132. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/03/third_battle_of_bull_run.html."

If woman suffrage wins in Ohio, it will sweep the Middle West and East in less than a generation. As Negroes have a larger proportion of women than the whites our relative voting importance in the North will be increased.\nMoreover, we need above all classes the women’s influence in politics—the influence of the mother, the wife, the teacher and the washerwoman. In the African fatherland the women stood high in counsel. We need them here again. It would be very bad, indeed, if the colored vote should be adverse to enfranchising women, even though it were not the deciding factor, for the day has gone by forever when colored men could get a respectful hearing for their protest against their own disfranchisement if, when offered the opportunity for voting for enfranchising their mothers, wives and sisters, they should fail to do so. For still another reason it will be unfortunate if the Ohio Negroes vote against votes for women; the vote will be analyzed with keen and eager intelligence, and the results studied for future use. The colored voters will turn many possible friends into critics, to put it mildly, if they inflict upon women that disfranchisement which all thinking people deplore when applied to the Negroes themselves. The general proposition that women ought to have the right to vote surely needs no argument among disfranchised colored folk:\nWomen are workers; workers should vote.\nWomen are taxpayers; taxpayers should vote.\nWomen have brains; voting needs brains.\nWomen organize, direct and largely support the family; families should vote.\nWomen are mothers of men; if men vote, why not women?\nIf politics are too nasty and rough for women voters, is it not time we asked the vote of women to cleanse them?\nIs there a single argument for the right of men to vote, or for the right of black men to vote, that does not apply to the votes for women, and particularly for black women?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVotes for Women (1914)\nVotes for Women (1918)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nVotes for Women (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Ohio.” The Crisis 4 (4):\n181–82. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/04/ohio.html."

    "title": "Two Suffrage Movements",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The woman suffrage movement in England and America really dates from the beginning of the anti-slavery struggle. It was not only contemporaneous with it, but it owes its existence in a large measure to this phase of the struggle for human rights. For it was in the abolitionist ranks that the early suffragists received their training, both as thinkers and propagandists. It was impossible for them to agitate continually for the freedom of the Negro without desiring freedom for themselves, or realizing the parallel between his situation and their own. For if the Negro was a slave the married woman of that day was no less a chattel. She was no longer openly bought and sold,1 but she had no more than he, a separate legal existence. If the Negro slave belonged to his master, she belonged no less, absolutely, to her husband as did her property, her earnings, and even her children. Both were disfranchised. Both were deprived of education and subject to economic disabilities which they shared with no other class. Even the constitutional right of free speech was not extended to woman when it meant public speech, as she found when she wished to join in the protest against slavery; and even among the abolitionists her presence on platforms and committees caused serious dissensions.\nThe most striking instance of this was offered at the World’s Anti-slavery Convention held in London in 1840, when the credentials of the American women delegates were refused for no other reason than that they were women. They were, indeed, allowed to be present, but not to have any part in the proceedings. With this they had to be content, as their fellow delegates apparently were, the only exceptions being William Lloyd Garrison and Nathaniel Rogers, the editor of the Herald of Freedom. Of all the men present these two alone seemed to realize that a principle was at stake, and rather than compromise on a point they felt to be vital they resigned their seats in the convention, remaining merely as spectators in the gallery.\nThis was one of many bitter experiences that taught women the lesson of their own impotence. To many of those rejected delegates, among them Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, it brought an overwhelming realization that they were still something less than human in the minds of most men and a conviction that their first duty was to free themselves from the artificial restraints imposed on them because of their sex; that then and then only they could work with men as equals. In these two women, at least, the action of the convention kindled a profound resolve to work toward this end, resulting in an agitation which culminated in the women’s rights convention of 1848 and its now famous “declaration of rights.” This convention held at Seneca Falls, N. Y., and attended by about 100 men and women, was denounced by the press of that date as “the most unnatural and shocking incident in the history of humanity,” while the declaration excited almost universal derision. This document stated the belief of its framers in the equality of men and women and demanded for women education, the liberty of entering all trades and professions, the right to appear in public, the right to “work with men in any good cause,” reminiscent of the anti-slavery convention, and, finally, the ballot.\nIt is significant that of all the resolutions offered at this convention this one alone was not unanimously adopted. It was finally carried by a small majority, but throughout the discussion only two of those present, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Frederick Douglass, warmly favored it. They alone at this stage seem to have grasped the fact that all rights and privileges go back to this most fundamental right. Throughout the storm of ridicule and abuse which broke out after the convention Douglass maintained his position and brilliantly defended the convention in his paper, The North Star.\nThe early history of the suffrage movement abounds with like incidents showing the help given to the cause by colored people. Perhaps none is more striking than the story of Sojourner Truth at the Akron convention, quoted from the “Reminiscences of Mrs. Frances D. Gage”:\nIf such incidents have been less frequent in recent years it is not because the profound and close connection between the Negro and women movements no longer exists. The parallel between their respective situations is as clear to-day as it was in 1848, but it is too frequently ignored by the reformers on both sides. Both have made some progress toward complete emancipation, the gains of women in the direction of enfranchisement being seemingly the more lasting. Both, however, are still very largely disfranchised, and subject to those peculiar educational, legal and economic discriminations that are the natural results of disfranchisement. And finally, both are being brought with every onward step nearer to the identical temptation—to sacrifice the principle of true democracy to the winning of a single skirmish. So when one sees a national body of suffragists refusing to pass a universal suffrage resolution, one is compelled to wonder at the logic of those who, knowing so well what disfranchisement means, would allow it to be inflicted on others. “Let us not confuse the issue,” these suffragists plead, some in good faith. Yet the confusion, if any, exists only in their minds. Here are not two distinet issues at stake, but merely the vital principle of democracy. Others insist that the granting of the ballot to women must precede all other reforms because “women have waited long enough” and recall the fact that women were forced to stand aside and see Negro men enfranchised at the close of the Civil War. This is undoubtedly true and was quite justly a source of bitter disappointment to the suffrage leaders of that day—a disappointment we should not underestimate—but merely to reverse the principals in an unjust occurrence is not to work justice. It is strange to see so many suffragists who point with pride to the action of Garrison in withdrawing from the antislavery convention, blind to the larger significance of that action. Stranger still to see them following, not Garrison’s lead, but that of the convention in their attitude toward colored people, and forgetting that no cause is great to the exclusion of every other. This Robert Purvis, a noted colored leader, understood, as is shown by his noble reply to the suffragists’ appeal: “I cannot agree that this or any hour is specially the Negro’s. I am an anti-slavery man. With what grace could I ask the women of this country to labor for my enfranchisement and at the same time be unwilling to put forth a hand to remove the tyranny in some respects greater to which they are exposed?” This is what all suffragists must understand, whatever their sex or color—that all the disfranchised of the earth have a common cause."

    "text": "Why should the colored voter be interested in woman’s suffrage? There are three cogent reasons. First, it is a great human question. Nothing human must be foreign, uninteresting or unimportant to colored citizens of the world. Whatever concerns half mankind concerns us. Secondly, any agitation, discussion or reopening of the problem of voting must inevitably be a discussion of the right of black folk to vote in America and Africa. Essentially the arguments for and against are the same in the case of all groups of human beings. The world with its tendencies and temptations to caste must ever be asking itself how far may the governed govern? How far can the responsibility of directing, curbing and encouraging mankind be put upon mankind? When we face this vastest of human problems frankly, most of us, despite ourselves and half unconsciously, find ourselves strangely undemocratic, strangely tempted to exclude from participation in government larger and larger numbers of our neighbors. Only at one point, with disconcerting unanimity, do we pause, and that is with ourselves. That we should vote we cannot for a moment doubt even if we are willing to acknowledge, as most of us are, that we are neither all wise nor infinitely good.\nThis fact should give us pause; if we in our potent weakness and shortcomings see the vast necessity for the ballot not only for our own selfish ends, but for the larger good of all our neighbors, do not our neighbors see the same necessity? And is not the unanswerable cogency of the argument for universal suffrage regardless of race or sex merely a matter of the point of view? Merely a matter of honestly putting yourself in the position of the disfranchised, and seeing the world through their eyes? The same arguments and facts that are slowly but surely opening the ballot box to women in England and America must open it to black men in America and Africa. It only remains for us to help the movement and spread the argument wherever we may. Finally, votes for women mean votes for black women. There are in the United States three and a third million adult women of Negro descent. Except in the rural South, these women have larger economic opportunity than their husbands and brothers and are rapidly becoming better educated. One has only to remember the recent biennial convention of colored women’s clubs with its 400 delegates to realize how the women are moving quietly but forcibly toward the intellectual leadership of the race. The enfranchisement of these women will not be a mere doubling of our vote and voice in the nation; it will tend to stronger and more normal political life, the rapid dethronement of the “heeler” and “grafter” and the making of politics a method of broadest philanthropic race betterment, rather than a disreputable means of private gain. We sincerely trust that the entire Negro vote will be cast for woman suffrage in the coming elections in Ohio, Kansas, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nWoman’s Suffrage (1913)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nThe Risk of Woman Suffrage (1915)\nThe Justice of Woman Suffrage (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Votes for Women.”\nThe Crisis 4 (5): 234. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/05/votes_for_women.html."

    "text": "Consider this argument: Education is the training of men for life. The best training is experience, but if we depended entirely upon this each generation would begin where the last began and _ civilization could not advance.\nWe must then depend largely on oral and written tradition and on such bits of typical experience as we can arrange for the child’s guidance to life.\nMore than that, children must be trained in the technique of earning a living and doing their part of the world’s work.\nBut no training in technique must forget that the object of education is the child and not the things he makes.\nMoreover, a training simply in technique will not do because general intelligence is needed for any trade. and the technique of trades changes.\nIndeed, by the careful training of intelligence and ability, civilization is continually getting rid of the hardest and most exhausting toil, and giving it over to machines, leaving human beings freer for higher pursuits and self-development.\nHence, colored people in educating their children should be careful:\nFirst: To conserve and select ability, giving to their best minds higher college training.\nSecond: They should endeavor to give all their children the largest possible amount of general training and intelligence before teaching them the technique of a particular trade, remembering that the object of all true education is not to make men carpenters, but to make carpenters men.\nIs not this reasoning sound? Could you imagine an educator of any experience who would take material exception to it? Would you call it revolutionary or in the nature of a “personal” attack?\nCertainly not.\nYet this very argument, with illustrations and emphasis delivered to some seven hundred apparently well-pleased folk in Indianapolis, has had the most astounding results. The Indianapolis Star in a leading editorial denounced it as “dangerous!”\nA leading white philanthropist of abolition forbears considered it not only “misleading” and “mischievous” but a covert and damaging personal attack!\nThe supervisor of the colored schools of Indianapolis wrote to express regret that the lecture had seemed to attack his school curriculum and ideals, and the assistant superintendent of schools in the District of Columbia hastens to give advice!\nYet where is the flaw in the argument?\nThere is no flaw, but there are serious flaws in the thinking of some of these critics.\nThe first flaw is the naive assumption that the paraphernalia of a school shows the education it is imparting. If some people see a Greek book and a cap and gown, they conclude that the boy between them is receiving higher education. But is he? That depends. If other people see a hammer, a saw and a cook book, they conclude that the boy who uses them is being trained in intélligence, ability and the earning of a living. But is he? That depends.\nWhen the proud principal of a school shows workshop and kitchen, table and pie, one may be interested, but one is no more convinced than when another shows an array of Greek roots and rounded phrases. One must merely remark: The end of education is neither the table nor the phrase—it is the boy; what kind of boys are you training here? Are they boys quickened in intelligence, with some knowledge of the world they live in? Are they trained in such ways as to discover their true bent and ability, and to be intelligently guided to the choice of a life work? Then your system is right. Otherwise it is wrong, and not all the gingham dresses in Indiana will justify it.\nThe second flaw is the more or less conscious determination of certain folk to use the American public-school system for the production of laborers who will do the work they want done. To them Indianapolis exists for the sake of its factories and not the factories for the sake of Indianapolis. They want dinners, chairs and motor cars, and they want them cheap; therefore use the public schools to train servants, carpenters and mechanics. It does not occur to them to think of workingmen as existing for their own sakes. What with impudent maids, and half-trained workingmen, they are tired of democracy; they.want caste; a place for everybody and everybody in his father’s place with themselves on top, and “Niggers” at the bottom where they belong. To such folk the problem of education is strikingly simple. To teach the masses to work; show them how to do things; increase their output; give them intelligence, of course; but this as a means, not as an end, and be careful of too much of it. Of course, if a meteoric genius bursts his birth’s invidious bar, let him escape, but keep up the bars, and as most men are fools, treat them and train them as such.\nIt was such darkened counsels as these that brought the French Revolution. It is such mad logie as this that is at the bottom of the social unrest to-day.\nThe lecturer came to Indianapolis not to criticise, but to warn—not to attack, but to make straight the way of the Lord. He is no despiser of common humble toil; God forbid! He and his fathers before him have worked with their hands at the lowliest occupations and he honors any honest toilers at any task; but he makes no mistake here. It is the toilers that he honors, not the task —the man and not the Thing. The Thing may or may not be honorable— the man always is.\nYet the despising of men is growing and the caste spirit is rampant in the land; it is laying hold of the public schools and it has the colored public schools by the throat, North, East, South and West. Beware of it, my brothers and dark sisters; educate your children. Give them the broadest and highest education possible; train them to the limit of their ability, if you work your hands to the bone in doing it. See that your child gets, not the highest task, but the task best fitted to his ability, whether it be digging dirt or painting landscapes; remembering that our recognition as common folk by the world depends on the number of men of ability we produce—not great geniuses, but efficient thinkers and doers in all lines. Never forget that if we ever compel the world’s respect, it will be by virtue of our heads and not our heels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCollege Education (1914)\nSchool (1918)\nThe Right to Work (1933)\nEducation (1911)\nEmployment (1932)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “Education.” The Crisis 4\n(2): 74–76. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/02/education.html."

    "text": "It happens that during this month, in the North, West and South, there are meeting the ruling Methodist ecclesiastical bodies representing a membership of 1,175,000 colored Americans. Later, in midsummer, the Baptist conventions, which represent 2,300,000 members, will meet. These three and a half millions of people represent the great middle class of colored Americans. The lowest class of outcasts have never been reached; the highest class of the educated and thoughtful are being gradually lost. The great middle mass remains, and in 35,000 churches holding $57,000,000 worth of property they form a peculiar organized government of men. Under some fifty powerful leaders and thirty thousand salaried local preachers they raise and expend over seven millions of dollars a year.\nBefore such an organization one must bow with respect. It has accomplished much. It has instilled and conserved morals, it has helped family life, it has taught and developed ability and given the colored man his best business training. It has planted in every city and town of the Union, with few exceptions, meeting places for colored folk which vary from shelters to luxurious and beautiful edifices.\nNotwithstanding this, all is not well with the colored church. First, its fifty leaders are in too many cases not the men they should be. This is not peculiar to the Negro church, but it is true to a larger degree than is healthful. We can point to pure-minded, efficient, unselfish prelates like the late Bishop Paine, the present Bishop Lee and J W. White. We have men of scholarship and standing like Bishop J. Albert Johnson, and we have efficient men of affairs like John F. Hurst, M.C.B. Mason and R.H. Boyd.\nThe trouble is, however, this: there are too few such men. The paths and the higher places are choked with pretentious ill-trained men and in far too many cases with men dishonest and otherwise immoral. Such men make the way of upright and businesslike candidates for power extremely difficult. They put an undue premium upon finesse and personal influence.\nHaving thus a partially tainted leadership, small wonder that the $30,000 colored ministers fall as a mass far below expectations. There are among them hustling business men, eloquent talkers, suave companions and hale fellows, but only here and there does one meet men like Henry L. Phillips of Philadelphia—burning spiritual guides of a troubled, panting people, utterly self-forgetful, utterly devoted to a great ideal of righteousness.\nYet this is precisely the type for which the church—the white church as well as the black church—is crying. This is the only type which will bold thoughtful, reasonable men to membership with this organization. To-day the tendencies are not this way. To-day the church is still inveighing against dancing and theatre-going, still blaming educated people for objecting to silly and empty sermons, boasting and noise, still building churches when people need homes and schools, and persisting in crucifying critics rather than realizing the handwriting on the wall.\nLet us trust that these great churches in conference, remembering the leaders of the past and conscious of all that the church has done well, will set their faces to these deeds:\n\nElecting as bishops and leaders only men of honesty, probity and efficiency and rejecting the noisy and unclean leaders of the thoughtless mob.\nWeeding out the ministry so as to increase the clean apostles of service and sacrifice.\nInitiating positive programs of education and social uplift and discouraging extravagant building and mere ostentation.\nBending every effort to make the Negro church a place where colored men and women of education and energy can work for the best things regardless of their belief or disbelief in unimportant dogmas and ancient and outworn creeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCrime (1918)\nThe Church (1916)\nThe Church and the Negro (1913)\nThe Methodist Church, North (1911)\nJesus Christ in Baltimore (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “The Negro Church.”\nThe Crisis 4 (1): 24–25. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/04/01/negro_church.html."

Recently Southern governors have united in protesting that the Negroes of their states are not disfranchised. They can vote, says McRae of Arkansas, “but not many of them do it.” “They disfranchise themselves,” says Parker of Louisiana. “They do not comply” with the election laws’ of the state, says Whitfield of Mississippi. They vote “as often as the whites,” says Peay of Tennessee. Their disfranchisement is “self-imposed,” says Fields of Kentucky. And so the governors of Georgia, Florida, Virginia, the Carolinas and Texas declare that honest to God they have not nullified the 14th and 15th amendments.\nAll this, of course, is silly subterfuge as the following facts will show: Only 12.8 per cent of the voters of Mississippi go to the polls; 19.7 per cent of the voters of Florida; 13.8 per cent in Alabama; 15.5 per cent in Arkansas; 13.2 per cent in Louisiana; and less than 7 per cent in that realm of crime and darkness that belongs to Cole Blease. Moreover, in 11 Southern. states the proportion of voters voting decreased between 1920 and 1924 from 6 per cent in Louisiana to nearly 36 per cent in Florida.\nWhat effect does this disfranchisement have upon the country?\n\nIt disfranchises Southern whites in almost as large proportion as Southern Negroes.\nIt throws the political power into the hands of cheap politicians and scoundrels. Men like Perry Howard are forced on the colored race. Not only are Howard’s actions denounced in Congress as “a disgrace to a decent government,” but he is accused by the papers of his own state of open collusion with white democrats; and he has supported for United States Marshal in the Northern district of Mississippi a politician concerning whom it has been charged in sworn affidavits that this man has helped to burn one Negro and lynch another.\nThere has been no re-districting of the basis of representation in the national House of Representatives for twenty-five years because the Rotten Boroughs of the South fear the necessary investigation.\nIt makes the national “Get-out-the-vote” campaign silly and meaningless.\nIt makes a third party movement impossible of success as long as the Southern white voter has seven times the political power of the Northern voter.\nIt encourages chicanery and mob law. Elizabeth Little, a colored woman, was put in jail in Birmingham, Alabama, last January for trying to register. The voters of the Negro town of Boley, Oklahoma, are fighting in the courts to compel the registrars to admit their names to the lists.\nIt stifles freedom of body and spirit in the South for, as Bertrand Russell says in Harper’s, “There cannot … be any freedom in parts of the world where white men govern colored populations.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Truth (1911)\nThe White Primary (1911)\nDisenfranchisement (1925)\nSouthern Representatives (1920)\nThe Negro Voter (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “Disenfranchisement.”\nThe Crisis 32 (1): 8–9. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/32/01/disenfranchisement.html."

    "text": "The junior organizations of the Ku Klux Klan are receiving thousands of copies of “Educational Studies Number 10” which concerns “the Negro and his relation to America.” This pamphlet is arranged without the slightest regard for Truth. It asserts, for instance: “The Negro is constantly increasing in criminality.” As a matter of fact, between 1910 and 1923 the number of Negroes committed for crime decreased over 26 per cent.\nIt discovers that 70 per cent of Negro criminals are under 30 years of age, but apparently does not know that 80 per cent of the white criminals in New York City are under 22.\nIt repeats the canard that educated Negroes are more criminal than the illiterates, a conclusion contradicted by every known fact and resting simply upon a partial census report in 1910. In this case they asked Negro criminals if they could read and write and naturally most of them said they could.\nWith these falsehoods go the usual half-truths, namely, that the Negro is the most criminal element in our population and that he is more criminal in the North than in the South.\nCrime is social disease; it is a complex result of poverty, ignorance and other sorts of social degradation. As the peculiar victim of these things the Negro in the United States suffers more from arrest and punishment at the hands of police and courts than any other element. This goes without saying.\nThe reason of it is clear. Practically the whole South traffics in Negro crime and makes money out of it. The convict lease system is in full blast in South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and elsewhere. It is called by other names and technically “reformed” from time to time but one has only to read the terrible exposures in the New York World of the money made out of selling criminals in Alabama and Florida to realize what is happening.\nThe natural delinquency arising from his position in the United States is increased by the Negro’s treatment in the courts and in jails. A legislative committee of investigation in South Carolina reported in 1923: “Both the superintendent and directors testify that there are no written or printed rules to govern the conduct of and control over prisoners. The situation might well be summed up as follows: the discipline-of the penitentiary is largely based on the personal likes and dislikes of the captain of the guard.”\nThe United States is deliberately manufacturing Negro crime and has been doing so for 150 years. And despite this, Negro crime has decreased 26 per cent in the last 13 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLogic (1914)\nCrime (1920)\nThe Old Story (1911)\nCourts and Jails (1932)\nHomicides (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “Crime.” The Crisis 32 (1):\n9–10. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/32/01/crime.html."

Twenty-one millions voted in 1922, thirty millions in 1924 and less than twenty-two millions in 1926. The eligible vote in 1926 was sixty-two millions. Only one citizen in three thought voting worth while. Americans think baseball is worth while; they think prize fighting is important; they think divorce trials and crime headlines news; but for fifty years, since the Negro was enfranchised, he and the American world have been taught that voting is a failure and democracy unequal to the task of efficient government. American after American, of wide power and influence, comes home from abroad lauding autocracy; a persistent campaign against state ownership and control of industry has had astonishing success; popular primary elections—once a triumph of democracy—are being laughed and shamed out of court.\nAnd what does all this failure and reaction prove?

    "text": "Each year on the 19th of January there is renewed effort to canonize Robert E. Lee, the great confederate general. His personal comeliness, his aristocratic birth and his military prowess all call for the verdict of greatness and genius. But one thing—one terrible fact—militates against this and that is the inescapable truth that Robert E. Lee led a bloody war to perpetuate human slavery. Copperheads like the New York Times may magisterially declare: “of course, he never fought for slavery.” Well, for what did he fight? State rights? Nonsense. The South cared only for State Rights as a weapon to defend slavery. If nationalism had been a stronger defense of the slave system than particularism, the South would have been as nationalist in 1861 as it had been in 1812.\nNo. People do not go to war for abstract theories of government. They fight for property and privilege and that was what Virginia fought for in the Civil War. And Lee followed Virginia. He followed Virginia not because he particularly loved slavery (although he certainly did not hate it), but because he did not have the moral courage to stand against his family and his clan. Lee hesitated and hung his head in shame because he was asked to lead armies against human progress and Christian decency and did not dare refuse. He surrendered not to Grant, but to Negro Emancipation.\nToday we can best perpetuate his memory and his nobler traits, not by falsifying his moral debacle, but by explaining it to the young white South. What Lee did in 1861, other Lees are doing in 1928. They lack the moral courage to stand up for justice to the Negro because of the overwhelming public opinion of their social environment. Their fathers in the past have condoned lynching and mob violence, just as today they acquiesce in the disfranchisement of educated and worthy black citizens, provide wretchedly inadequate public schools for Negro children and endorse a public treatment of sickness, poverty and crime which disgraces civilization.\nIt is the punishment of the South that its Robert Lees and Jefferson Davises will always be tall, handsome and well-born. That their courage will be physical and not moral. That their leadership will be weak compliance with public opinion and never costly and unswerving revolt for justice and right. It is ridiculous to seek to excuse Robert Lee as the most formidable agency this nation ever raised to make 4 million human beings goods instead of men. Either he knew what slavery meant when he helped maim and murder thousands in its defense, or he did not. If he did not he was a fool. If he did, Robert Lee was a traitor and a rebel—not indeed to his country, but to humanity and humanity’s God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLee (1912)\nEmancipation (1913)\nTillman (1918)\nRemember (1920)\nThe Macon Telegraph (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Robert E.

    "text": "South Bend, Ind.\nDear Sir:\nI am only a high school student in my Sophomore year, and have not the understanding of you college educated men. It seems to me that since The Crisis is the Official Organ of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People which stand for equality for all Americans, why would it designate, and segregate us as “Negroes”, and not as “Americans.”\nThe most piercing thing that hurts me in this February  Crisis, which forced me to write, was the notice that called the natives of Africa, “Negroes,” instead of calling them “Africans,” or “natives.”\nThe word, “Negro,” or “nigger,” is a white man’s word to make us feel inferior. I hope to be a worker for my race, that is why I wrote this letter. I hope that by the time I become a man, that this word, “Negro,” will be abolished.\nRoland A. Barton.\n\nMy Dear Barton:\nDo not at the outset of your career make the all too common error of mistaking names for things. Names are only conventional signs for identifying things. Things are the reality that counts. If a thing is despised, either because of ignorance or because it is despicable, you will not alter matters by changing its name. If men despise Negroes, they will not despise them less if Negroes are called “colored” or “Afro-Americans.”\nMoreover, you cannot change the name of a thing at will. Names are not merely matters of thought and reason; they are growths and habits. As long as the majority of men mean black or brown folk when they say “Negro,” so long will Negro be the name of folks brown and black. And neither anger nor wailing nor tears can or will change the name until the name-habit changes.\nBut why seek to change the name? “Negro” is a fine word. Etymologically and phonetically it is much better and more logical than “African” or “colored” or any of the various hyphenated circumlocutions. Of course, it is not “historically” accurate. No name ever was historically accurate: neither “English,” “French,” “German,” “White,” “Jew,” “Nordic” nor “Anglo-Saxon.” They were all at first nicknames, misnomers, accidents, grown eventually to conventional habits and achieving accuracy because, and simply because, wide and continued usage rendered them accurate. In this sense “Negro” is quite as accurate, quite as old and quite as definite as any name of any great group of people.\nSuppose now we could change the name. Suppose we arose tomorrow morning and lo! instead of being “Negroes,” all the world called us “Cheiropolidi,”—do you really think this would make a vast and momentous difference to you and to me? Would the Negro problem be suddenly and eternally settled? Would you be any less ashamed of being descended from a black man, or would your schoolmates feel any less superior to you? The feeling of inferiority is in you, not in any name. The name merely evokes what is already there. Exorcise the hateful complex and no name can ever make you hang your head.\nOr, on the other hand, suppose that we slip out of the whole thing by calling ourselves “Americans.” But in that case, what word shall we use when we want to talk about those descendants of dark slaves who are largely excluded still from full American citizenship and from complete social privilege with white folk? Here is Something that we want to talk about; that we do talk about; that we Negroes could not live without talking about. In that case, we need a name for it, do we not? In order to talk logically and easily and be understood. If you do not believe in the necessity of such a name, watch the antics of a colored newspaper which has determined in a fit of New Year’s Resolutions not to use the word “Negro!”\nAnd then too, without the word that means Us, where are all those spiritual ideals, those inner bonds, those group ideals and forward strivings of this mighty army of 12 millions? Shall we abolish these with the abolition of a name? Do we want to abolish them? Of course we do not. They are our most precious heritage.\nHistorically, of course, your dislike of the word Negro is easily explained: “Negroes” among your grandfathers meant black folk; “Colored” people were mulattoes. The mulattoes hated and despised the blacks and were insulted if called “Negroes.” But we are not insulted—not you and I. We are quite as proud of our black ancestors as of our white. And perhaps a little prouder. What hurts us is the mere memory that any man of Negro descent was ever so cowardly as to despise any part of his own blood.\nYour real work, my dear young man, does not lie with names. It is not a matter of changing them, losing them, or forgetting them. Names are nothing but little guideposts along the Way. The Way would be there and just as hard and just as long if there were no guideposts,—but not quite as easily followed! Your real work as a Negro lies in two directions: First, to let the world know what there is fine and genuine about the Negro race. And secondly, to see that there is nothing about that race which is worth contempt; your contempt, my contempt; or the contempt of the wide, wide world.\nGet this then, Roland, and get it straight even if it pierces your soul: a Negro by any other name would be just as black and just as white; just as ashamed of himself and just as shamed by others, as today. It is not the name—it’s the Thing that counts. Come on, Kid, let’s go get the Thing!\nW. E. B.

    "text": "While I was in Chicago, a listener at Winnetka threw this question at me, tensely, with evident deep resentment: “What have you to say to the course of Negro politicians who are following Thompson in the municipal campaign?” I answered the question indirectly and unsatisfactorily, because its fuller answer would have called for a lecture in itself. I said merely, “The Negro in Chicago and the Negro in New York has as much right to ally himself to political graft as represented by Tammany and Thompson, as have more respectable people, in allying themselves with Insul and Vare and Frank Smith.”\nThe whole matter, however, calls for deeper explanation and frank heart searching on the part of the American Negro. What happens to us continually is this: If we keep out of politics, we give the whip hand to our enemies. They pass segregation laws; they curtail liberty of the press and of speech; they hinder the right to organize; they discriminate by law, not simply against color, but against ignorance and poverty and the victims of any deep-seated public dislike. We have got to vote or be enslaved.\nWhen we vote, we do not have a chance to vote on the real merits of the questions presented. We cannot consider the tariff, farm relief, war, peace, municipal ownership, superpower, and a dozen other pressing political questions. No, we have got to ask: Does Herbert Hoover believe that Negroes are men or sub-men? What is the attitude of A1 Smith toward the Negro problem? Does Reed of Missouri believe in education for Negroes or is he part of the conspiracy that deprives Lincoln University of decent buildings? Can any man born south of the Mason and Dixon Line be for a moment considered as a man or must he always be put down as a raging beast, in alliance with lynching, disfranchisement, “Jim Crow” cars, and public insult?\nUnder such circumstances, intelligent voting on the part of colored men in the United States becomes a disheartening farce. In Chicago, they can choose between two things: on the one hand, open gambling, bootlegging, prostitution, and Thompson; and on the other hand, segregation, denial of representation, loss of decent jobs and public insult under Deneen or the Democrats. What on earth is an honest black voter to do?\nIn New York, there is the same impossible dilemma. Tammany and a Mayor, who is still unable to explain a certain incident in Italy; on the other silk-stocking snobs, who refuse the Negroes representation and gerrymander them out of the city Hall, the state legislature and the United States Congress.\nIn the same way, the Philadelphia Negro can choose between Vare and bribery, or graft, Pepper, snobbery, and “Jim Crow” schools. Who can blame the American Negro if he votes for the worst, when it is only in this sort of alliance that he can receive the semblance of decent treatment?\nOn the other hand, it is perfectly clear that the Negroes who are supporting graft and political machines in the chief cities of the United States, are thereby incurring the distrust, enmity and active opposition of the intelligent people of the United States; of those very people who with all their vision, never, so far as the Negro is concerned, see beyond their own noses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro in Politics (1929)\nChicago (1927)\nThe Presidential Campaign (1916)\nThe Negro Party (1916)\nFerdinand Q.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many persons are under the impression that the N.A.A.C.P. has been the persistent enemy of Marcus Garvey. This is due to repeated accusations published in the Negro World without the slightest basis of fact. For the sake of the truth, it may be well to recall certain matters of clear record.\nThe Crisis has published five articles on Marcus Garvey. The first two articles, March 1920 and January 1921 ended with this summary:\n\nTo sum up: Garvey is a sincere, hard-working idealist; he is also stubborn, domineering leader of the mass; he has worthy industrial and commercial schemes but he is an inexperienced business man. His dreams of Negro industry, commerce and the ultimate freedom of Africa are feasible; but his methods are bombastic, wasteful, illogical and ineffective and almost illegal. If he learns by experience, attracts strong and capable friends and helpers instead of making needless enemies; if he gives up secrecy and suspicion and substitutes open and frank reports as to his income and expenses, and above all if he is willing to be a co-worker and not a czar, he may yet in time succeed in at least starting some of his schemes toward accomplishment. But unless he does these things and does them quickly he cannot escape failure.\n\nNo more prophetic word was ever written about Marcus Garvey! The third and fourth articles dealt with the Black Star Line and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and were based on published documents with little comment.\nIt was not until September, 1922, that The Crisis had a sharp word of criticism. This was based on Garvey’s threats against his critics, his connection with the Ku Klux Klan and his distribution of pamphlet propaganda against American Negroes. We quoted, among other things, this:\n\nThe white race can best help the Negro by telling him the truth, and not by flattering him into believing that he is as good as any white man.\n\nConcerning this we said:\n\nNot even Tom Dixon or Ben Tillman or the hatefulest enemies of the Negro have ever stooped to a more vicious campaign than Marcus Garvey, sane or insane, is carrying on. He is not attacking white prejudice, he is grovelling before it and applauding it; his only attack is on men of his own race who are striving for freedom; his only contempt is for Negroes; his only threats are for black blood.\n\nOn the other hand Garvey’s attacks on the N.A.A.C.P. have been continuous, preposterous and false. He has claimed:\n\nThat we kept his representative from activity in Paris in 1919.\nThat Moorfield Storey came from Boston to secure his conviction in 1924.\nThat the collapse of the Black Star Line came about “because men were paid to make this trouble by certain organizations calling themselves Negro Advancement Associations. They paid men to dismantle our machinery and otherwise damage it so as to bring about the downfall of the movement.”\nThat the N.A.A C.P. was responsible for his incarceration and deportation.\n\nEvery single statement in these and dozens of similar charges are absolutely false and without any basis of fact whatsoever. As The Crisis said in May, 1924:\n\nNo Negro in America ever had a fairer and more patient trial than Marcus Garvey. He convicted himself by his own admissions, his swaggering monkey-shines in the court room with monocle and long tailed coat and his insults to the judge and prosecuting attorney.\nMarcus Garvey was long refused bail, not because of his color, but because of the repeated threats and cold-blooded assaults charged against his organization. He himself openly threatened to ‘get’ the District Attorney. His followers had repeatedly to be warned from intimidating witnesses and one was sent to jail therefor. One of his former trusted officials after being put out of the Garvey organization brought the long concealed cash account of the organization to this office and we published it. Within two weeks the man was shot in the back in New Orleans and killed.\nEverybody, including the writer, who has dared to make the slightest criticism of Garvey has been intimidated by threats and threatened with libel suits. Over fifty court cases have been brought by Garvey in the last two years.\n\nWe are reminding our readers of all this not to revive forgotten rancor but for the sake of historical accuracy. When Garvey was sent to Atlanta, no word or action of ours accomplished the result. His release and deportation was a matter of law which no deed or wish of ours influenced in the slightest degree. We have today, no enmity against Marcus Garvey. He has a great and worthy dream. We wish him well. He is free; he has a following; he still has a chance to carry on his work in his own home and among his own people and to accomplish some of his ideals. Let him do it. We will be the first to applaud any success that he may have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMarcus Garvey (1921)\nA Lunatic or a Traitor (1924)\nRadicals (1919)\nMarcus Garvey (1920)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Marcus Garvey and the NAACP.”\nThe Crisis 35 (2): 51. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/02/marcus_garvey.html."

    "title": "The Dunbar National Bank",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The establishment of the Dunbar National Bank in New York City, may be simply another bank; but it might prove to be an epoch making event for the darker races of the world. Here is a bank with over a million dollars of capital and surplus, with a colored and white directorate and a colored and white personnel. Even though white business men and capital predominate in numbers and authority, yet the possibilities of such an organization are tremendous.\nIn the present organization of the world in politics and industry the line between capital and labor coincides roughly to the line between the white and darker races. Whatever salvation the darker races seek under present conditions must be attained through their admission to the ranks of capitalists.\nFailing this, they must fight capital and modern industry and their fight must be primarily racial and not based on the intrinsic merits or demerits of capitalistic industry.\nThus two questions face Negroes and Chinese and Indians.\nFirst, is capitalism, as at present organized, the best director of work and income? Second, can the darker peoples secure voice and influence in the governing councils of modern organized capital? These are separate questions, but they tend to be one today, because organized capital today is almost exclusively in white control. The control of capital and credit enables the white people of the world to rule the world for their own benefit and to ignore whenever they so wish, the best interests of the colored peoples.\nThe leaders of colored thought, therefore, are faced by this problem: is the whole capitalistic system wrong or is the color problem merely the problem of securing for the darker people proper representation in the centers of capitalistic control? This question has been variously answered.\nBooker T. Washington in the United States, most of the Negro leaders of West Africa, and some of the leaders of India, have seen salvation in a chance to share the capitalistic control of industry with white Europe and America. Others, including the Editor of The Crisis, believe that industrial reform must be far more radical than this.\nBut no matter what differences of opinion arise on this point, so long as organized capital excludes Negroes and other darker folk from its counsels and official positions, just so long will this people be forced toward radical industrial reform.\nIt is useless to reply that the capitalistic system is always open to individual merit. That is not true so far as white boys are concerned, and it is a fiat lie in the case of black boys. No black boy today, no matter what his education or ability, has any chance of admission and promotion in a white bank, insurance company, corporation or manufacturing concern. And no bank organized by black folk has a ghost of a chance to grow to real power in a financial world dominated by white banks and white captains of industry. Indeed, it has become almost axiomatic in England and America to put no real financial or industrial power in the hands of black folk.\nRepeated attempts have been made to break over this industrial dead line: on the Gold Coast in West Africa in connection with the cocoa trade; in the establishment of some fifty small Negro banks in the United States; in various co-operative movements in Asia and Africa;—none of these movements have had any real and conspicuous success. Each one has found itself eventually in the masterful grasp of the great white capitalistic monopoly.\nIt is not too much to say that the Dunbar National Bank offers the greatest opportunity of modern days for something different. One cannot think that Mr. John Rockefeller, Jr., and his associates have gone into this enterprise merely for profit. They must have a vision. How wide is that vision? It may, of course, be narrow and conventional: the training of colored bank officials, the extension of credit to promising small colored enterprises. This would be of value. Eventually, it would lead to better banking among Negroes and more adventure in business. But ultimately, it would do little more than to emphasize the division among colored people into rich and poor, exploiter and exploited, landlord and tenant, employer and employee.\nBeyond this there should be, and we sincerely trust there is, a wider and broader dream. This dream would be to break up the controlling caste in organized capitalistic industry; to say to the world that the use of capital is one of the greatest of modern inventions and it must no longer be monopolized by white people. We are going to train colored people in its use and proper control, and through these trained men, we are going to see how far it is possible in the United States, in the West Indies, and in Africa, to put colored men in control of capital and credit, and to let them develop it, not simply for the profit of white people, but for the advancement of darker peoples.\nAnd this is no idle dream. A proper use of capital and credit in the cocoa raising regions of the Gold Coast of Africa would do more to emancipate black West Africa and educate and uplift Negroes, than any other single movement. The West Indies, by far the most beautiful part of the new world, are today prostrate and enslaved under the heels of absentee white capitalists and landlords. They could be redeemed if the power of capital and credit was put into the hands of trained colored men who believe or could be led to believe in the possibilities of Negro blood. American imperialism in Haiti and Central America, instead of being carried out by “Nigger”-hating Louisianians, could be put in the hands of black Americans who believe in Haitian freedom and independence.\nThe seemingly insoluble problems of South Africa and of East Africa could be mitigated in the same way. While in the United States the only thing that is going to save organized labor and bring true industrial democracy, is the abolition of the color line in capital and credit.\nWe shall look forward then with interest to the development of this bank. If it adds simply one more bank in Harlem to the banks of New York, we shall be profoundly disappointed, no matter how large its capital and how great its dividends. If it takes a real step toward an industrial democracy which includes the darker races, we shall hail it as one of the great steps of the 20th Century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nInvestments (1921)\nBooming The Crisis (1914)\nY.M.C.A (1914)\nDoes Organization Pay?

    "text": "To the hard worker in a great modern city the problem of the casual visitor is baffling. No one needs visitors more than he: he needs the enlivening and quickening contact with the world outside the office. He needs to keep human and to resist the mechanical trend of his city routine. He needs the knowledge that comes by word of mouth to correct and make real the printed page.\nOn the other hand, if visitors want to greet a man, it is because he has done something—has thought, written, acted, inspired. And if a man is going to do anything today in New York, on Fifth Avenue, in a modern office, he must have periods of quiet, intensive, uninterrupted work.\nHere comes the Visitor. He knows and appreciates what the Worker is doing. He wants to see him, to know him, to tell him. The Worker needs to be told. He works in a strange unmeaning silence. His voice has no echoes. No one seems to listen. No one cares—What’s the use? And then—in bursts the Visitor with outstretched hand and shining eves and joy and laughter in his voice! The world lives and moves again.\nBut—both Visitor and Worker must have some modicum of common sense. The Visitor blows in town on holiday. He sleeps well, eats heartily and at eleven A.M. says gaily: “Now for The Crisis office!” But pause, friend. Why not just go to the ’phone and say: “I’m in town. Want to see you. When are you free?” And the editor responds: “Could you come at 2? Good!” All is well. Both are happy. Both are helped.\nBut if the Editor is not asked and you burst in on his poised pen; if you interrupt a carefully arranged morning or a happy thought surging to be born —if you do this for no other reason but that you are too lazy to arrange a mutually convenient time—well, the Editor may be unhappy. He may think that his convenience has a right to be considered as well as yours.\n\nI was sitting in my office with a helper reading the stone-proof of the magazine: last day, last hour. It must be down at 5 or the schedule of a great printing house with 25 magazines to print would be thrown out of kilter, 800 agents would await a late magazine, and 100,000 readers would yell: “C.P.T..” We were working like hell with an hour to finish an hour and a half’s work.—\n“Miss Blink and Miss Blank of Seattle, to see the Editor.”\nFrankly I am furious. The Misses B. and B. could just as easily have called an hour later or an hour earlier. Three minutes on the telephone could have arranged a delightful visit with two intelligent and educated women whom I needed to see and question and explain. One knew Youth— mysterious, prophetic, eternal Youth. And one knew Art, subtle, intriguing trick of thought—beauty of way and mean. I could learn something of both—but not then and now—for a Ghost with dripping hands hovered above me and I had to finish that proof.\nWell—I did not see them. As a result, I lost two good and helpful friends. In vain did I write next day explanation and apology. They were insulted to the last degree. Selah.\nI am not altogether blameless. I often discount human facts in comparison with divine thoughts. I cannot jump readily from the understanding mind to the glad hand. And yet, frank and sympathetic comprehension of my problem and of the problem of the Visitor might bring mutual understanding.\nThe problem has many attempted solutions: sound proof, inner sanctums which leave the public office frankly empty—“Stepped out”; “in conference”; staring printed signs about not being at home except at such and such hours; secret bells, like Bismark’s to summon oneself to mythical appointments; or alibis like that of a friend of mine. I used to find him easily ensconsed in his office with smiles and open door. The public was cordially welcome, whether on business or without—crank, book agent or prophet, for a few minutes or a few hours.\n“How do you do it?” I gasped, aghast.\n“Just waste the day,” he grinned. “Go home to dinner; take a nap, and work from Midnight to 4A.M.!”\n“H’m!” I remarked. Two years later he had a stroke of paralysis.\nI have a colleague across the way. I have seen him stagger out of his office at noon with death in his eye— Death of a Big Job—murder of a fine idea. Some friend had dropped in “just for a minute” and staid an hour!\nAnd so, let’s get together on this thing. I want to see you, Visitor, I really do. But can’t we compromise on the hour, if not the day? I’ll go half way—honest, I will.\n\nNever mind Me, but respect my Work. My Work is cold, calm, relentless. It will be done now or never. It is merciless. It glares at me cruel- kind, malignant-gracious:\n“Tuesday’s Work undone? Good! Here’s Wednesday’s!”\nI shriek in vain, wring my hands— “But Tuesday?”\nThe Work answers, very softly and smooth:\n“There is no Tuesday. Tuesday is dead. Dead forever and forever. And Monday and last week and year 1927.”\n“But Tuesday’s work is not done,” I wail, and it echoes:\n“It shall never be done. Here is Today and Wednesday and this year. They are yours. Work or die.”\nSometimes I seek to fool my Master, Work. I enter stealthily Wednesday, lugging Tuesday’s undone task beneath my vest. He says no word. His face is grey and grim. I know I can never deceive my Master.\nAnd yet often, when the finished Deed stands sleek before me, clothed like a Book, an Editorial, a Speech, a Letter,—I sigh and say:\n“I have bought you with my Friends—and I have but few left.” Not me, not me, Lord Visitor, craves your thoughtful sympathy and co-operation, but the Master.\nIf we cajole him and seek to do his will, he may nod uneasily and sleep, snore and dream! Ah, when my Work dreams, that is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory of my friends. Then we will smoke and eat and carouse and make love and play. He will awake to find us more than ready and wild with waiting.\nHappy are the workless and the Idle, who can just enjoy and need not think! But I, (woe is me!) I am the grandson of a Seventh Son, born with a Veil. From all Eternity I am sentenced to toil—and to love it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAdvice (1910)\nThe Browsing Reader (1928)\nA Pilgrimage To The Negro Schools (1929)\nLondon (1911)\nTravel (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Visitors.” The Crisis 35\n(7): 239–40. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/07/visitors.html."

They opened their convention with an atrocious lynching. They segregated their black visitors back of a wire cage. They nominated for Vice President (an office which, since the Civil War, has made its incumbent President in four cases) a typical Arkansas bourbon. Even the nomination of Alfred Smith does not relieve the situation. Smith is an excellent administrator and his attitude on liquor is at least honest, while Hoover’s is not; but so far as we can learn Alfred Smith has seldom been aware of the black citizens of the state of New York. He has given 250,000 Negroes of the state only one major appointment and has shown for black people not the slightest personal interest or appreciation. He has consistently vetoed every bill and movement which Negroes advocated.\nThe Catholic church, to which Smith belongs, knows no color line in all the world except in the United States; but here it is “Jim-Crow” from top to bottom in church attendance, in education, in philanthropy, in missionary endeavor.\nFinally, whatever Smith and his entourage might be inclined to do to attract Negro support, they are absolutely estopped from doing by their corrupt bargain with the solid South and their craven fear of the “liberal” South. Black voters of the North who support Smith should first vote for him and then commit suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Election (1928)\nOn the Fence (1928)\nThe Presidential Campaign (1916)\nThe Negro in Politics (1929)\nSmith (1927)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Houston.” The Crisis 35\n(9): 312. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/09/houston.html."

    "text": "According to the Census of 1920, there were in the United States 60,886,520 persons twenty-one years of age and over. Of these 5,522,475, or a little over 9 per cent were Negroes. Of these Negroes, 1,512,987 were illiterate, leaving a possible Negro voting population of sufficient intelligence to read and write of over 4,000,000. Disfranchisement cuts this figure considerably. Neither whites nor Negroes in the District of Columbia vote. In Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, there is a considerable Negro vote cast for presidential candidates, but Negro votes are not effective so far as Congressmen are concerned. In South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, nine-tenths of the Negroes are disfranchised. The possible Negro vote in these states is 2,722,048. This left in 1920, 2,800,427 possible Negro voters in the United States.\nSince that time, the Negro population has increased and the migration from South to North has transferred a considerable number of Negroes from disfranchisement to a territory where they can vote. It will, therefore, be possible for at least 3,000,000 and possibly three and a quarter million of Negroes to vote in the next presidential election.\nThese voters will be distributed roughly as follows:\nIn the New England States, there will be 60,000 colored voters, out of a total vote of 4,500,000. In the Middle Atlantic States, there will be 500,000 colored voters, out of a possible 13,500,000. In the East North Central States, there will be 450,000 colored voters, out of a possible 13,000,000. In the West North Central States, 200,000 colored voters, out of a possible 7,250,000. In the South Atlantic States, the Negro voters will be ineffective except in Delaware, Maryland and West Virginia, where they will cast 250,000 votes, out of a possible 1,750,000. In the Mountain and Pacific States, Negroes will cast perhaps 75,000 votes, out of a possible 5,500,000.\nTo this must be added two considerations: first of all, all persons, twenty-one years of age and over in the United States for various reasons, do not vote. In the Presidential Election of 1920, only 26,674,171 votes were cast, out of the possible 60,886,520. If the Negro voter is alert, he may, therefore, cast even more than one-tenth of the actual vote, despite disfranchisement in the South. Certainly, in many of the states intelligent use of the Negro vote can bring results.\nWe may assume that in 1928, the total vote cast in the following states and the Negro vote will be something as follows:\n\n\n\nPossible Votes, 1928\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\nNegro\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassachusetts\n\n\n1,150,000\n\n\n25,000\n\n\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\n200,000\n\n\n5,000\n\n\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\n400,000\n\n\n12,000\n\n\n\n\nNew York\n\n\n3,300,000\n\n\n150,000\n\n\n\n\nNew Jersey\n\n\n1,100,000\n\n\n75,000\n\n\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\n2,150,000\n\n\n200,000\n\n\n\n\nOhio\n\n\n2,100,000\n\n\n125,000\n\n\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\n1,300,000\n\n\n50,000\n\n\n\n\nIllinois\n\n\n2,500,000\n\n\n125,000\n\n\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\n1,200,000\n\n\n60,000\n\n\n\n\nIowa\n\n\n1,000,000\n\n\n10,000\n\n\n\n\nMissouri\n\n\n1,400,000\n\n\n125,000\n\n\n\n\nNebraska\n\n\n475,000\n\n\n10,000\n\n\n\n\nKansas\n\n\n675,000\n\n\n35,000\n\n\n\n\nDelaware\n\n\n100,000\n\n\n15,000\n\n\n\n\nMaryland\n\n\n375,000\n\n\n140,000\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\n600,000\n\n\n50,000\n\n\n\n\nKentucky\n\n\n850,000\n\n\n125,000\n\n\n\n\nTennessee\n\n\n400,000\n\n\n225,000\n\n\n\n\nColorado\n\n\n350,000\n\n\n10,000\n\n\n\n\nArizona\n\n\n80,000\n\n\n6,000\n\n\n\n\nWashington\n\n\n425,000\n\n\n6,000\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\n1,300,000\n\n\n40,000\n\n\n\n\nThis, of course, will only be true in case the Negro attends to his election duties with unusual assiduity,—that is, votes even more largely than the white. That he ought to do this arises from his peculiar position. In every single one of these states, the Negro vote is important.\nEven in New England, while it forms only two or three per cent of the total vote, nevertheless, it is concentrated in certain strategic centers, like Boston, Providence and New Haven, where it will effect the congressional vote; and with Smith as the Democratic candidate the fight between Protestants and Catholics is going to be so close that the black voters will be needed.\nIn the industrial East, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the Negro can cast 425,000 out of 6,500,000 votes. This is between six and seven per cent, and that is a very important bloc. The fight in the East is a fight between organized wealth and industry, on the one hand, and organized labor and radical reform on the other. The issues will be clouded. Smith is no enemy to organized wealth, and Hoover is no friend of organized labor. It will be hard for these elements in many cases to choose between the two leaders. They will have, however, no such difficulty of choice in voting for congressmen and the issues will often be clear-cut and the Negro vote of large importance.\nIn the Middle West, out of a total of 7,000,000 votes, the Negro should have at least 350,000, or 5 per cent. Wisely used, this means the balance of power, not only in the Presidential Election but in the election of congressmen; because the fight in the Middle West over the issues of liquor, Catholicism, the farmer, labor and industry, is going to be fierce.\nThe farm issue will, of course, be emphasized in Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Kansas. Here again the Negro will have 7 per cent of the vote and he ought to use every ounce of his power to the greatest advantage.\nThe Southern Border States present, of course, the usual anomaly. In Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, out of a vote of about 2,225,000, Negroes should cast 25 per cent. This is enough to control the election; but the Negro vote in these states has for a long time been shamelessly manipulated. There is not only open bribery and economic intimidation, but there is the prevailing problem of what the Negro can cast his vote for if he bolts the Republican Party. He dare not vote for the Democrats when the Democrats act as they have recently in Tennessee and he can hardly with self-respect vote with the Republicans of Kentucky. Certainly in Delaware and Maryland the Negro can afford to vote for the local Democratic Ticket in many cases. The results of doing this in the past have proven its wisdom; but it is worth careful thought and prolonged negotiation.\nAll things considered in the election of 1928, the Negro voter has the greatest chance for intelligent and purposeful independence than has come to him in a generation.\n(In future numbers we shall discuss: the effect of disfranchisement in the South; the presidential candidates; the congressional candidates and the issues at stake in the campaign.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPolitical Straws (1923)\nDisenfranchisement (1925)\nThe Election (1924)\nVotes (1919)\nThe White Primary (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “The Negro Voter.”\nThe Crisis 35 (8): 275–76. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/08/negro_voter.html."

    "text": "There were four refugee camps at Vicksburg: Camp Hayes, Camp Juarez, Camp Louisiana and Camp Fort Hill. The lovely hills of the National Park, where once the Confederate and Union armies were camped, made an ideal location high above the muddy River and the little town of Vicksburg.\nIn Camp Hayes a spreading magnolia tree opened its waxy blossoms over the Red Cross Headquarters tent, on the top of the hill. On either side in regular rows stretched the brown tents sheltering twelve hundred white refugees: one family to a tent; a cot to each member of the family; and as many blankets as necessary. While among them were a few owners and occasional small merchants or mechanics, the majority of these refugees were tenant-farmers or share-croppers on large plantations, in a state of perpetual indebtedness to the planter. Being white they had recourse to law to defend themselves and were accorded a certain consideration and respect. Economically they were little or no better off than the Negroes on the same plantations, which increased their race hatred, as well as their resentment toward the planters. “They treat us like niggers,” they remarked bitterly, indicating the lowest inhumanity. Many of them were sturdy, hard working citizens, struggling to get ahead enough to buy their few acres. Those who were already owners were burdened by heavy mortgages. Among them were some who were known in their local communities as desperadoes, bragging of the number of murders they had committed. “I killed five before breakfast once,” one of these drawled. “Didn’t hurt my appetite none.” Yes, he was acquitted — the jury valued their own lives.\nSide by side with these were the tents of pious members of the Church of Christ, who held religious meetings in a tent on the hill every afternoon and evening for nearly three months. These added much to the enjoyment of these refugees. “I love this place,” one of them said; “it’s just like a camp-meeting.”\nAbout two miles from Camp Hayes on another hill in the same great park, was the colored camp Louisiana, six thousand strong, several families to a tent, cots only for the aged and ill, but as many brown army blankets as needed. Camp Juarez, where four hundred Mexicans found safety, was located at the foot of a hill, just below the National Cemetery, in a convenient rustic pavilion, large enough for the whole camp. Camp Fort Hill numbered at least six thousand colored refugees, and commanded on one side a view of the River, with tree tops rising from it at intervals, on the other the roofs of the town. In this camp eight or nine families to a tent were common and cots were few.\nThe most impressive thing about these camps was the incredible melancholy of the colored refugees. There was no laughter, no music, no Negro light-heartedness. They sat in silent apathy, or talked in low tones. They had come from scenes of horror, many of them, greater than any white refugees knew, as the helplessness of the Negro in Mississippi exceeds anything known to whites. One woman stood all night waist-deep in rising water. A few rods away, but out of sight, her husband screamed for help. He could not be reached. After a while his screams stopped. In the morning there was no sign of him. Two young girls went to the Red Cross tent day after day to ask for news of their brother who had been taken to work on the levee at Greenville. At last the news came: he had been found drowned near the levee. The girls turned without a word and went in silence to their own tent, tears streaming down their faces. There was no sound of mourning, no lamentation in the camp. The calamity of all was too great for that easy expression.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe refugee camps were maintained by the American National Red Cross. That is, the Red Cross furnished the supplies, paid the bills and decided all matters of policy. The Red Cross nurses and doctors held a daily clinic. One or two Red Cross workers stationed in each camp attended to such matters as registering refugees, issuing passes to leave camp, giving out clothing, blankets, etc., and arranging transportation for refugees leaving to return home. The last item was the most difficult, especially in the colored camps. In the white camps transportation on the river boats was issued io individual refugees at their request. All that was necessary was for the refugee to establish the fact that he had a place to live—that his house was out of the water or that friends or relatives on dry land would take him in. Passes were even issued frequently to men with families to go to their homes in order to find out what conditions were and get their places in order before returning to camp and taking their families back with them. Sometimes they found conditions so hopeless that they returned to camp immediately and waited a few weeks then went back on another scouting trip. But whereas the transportation issued to white refugees, whether owners or sharecroppers, was on an individual basis, with the Negroes the situation was quite different. A very large proportion of the colored refugees were from the big cotton plantations of Washington County, one hundred and fifty miles and more from single plantations. In this case the planter sent or brought in a list of the names of “his niggers” and transportation for them was given to him. These Negroes were given no choice in the matter. When the planter came to take them home with them, home they went. The only way to avoid this was by slipping out of camp at night and taking refuge with colored people in Vicksburg. This they frequently did, as is shown by the fact that, after the camps were closed, the files showed over 3,000 Negroes “registered but not in camp.” Probably the number of “runaways” was much larger, as many of those actually in camp were never registered and their escape was relatively easy. By far the majority of the Negroes were share-croppers, held in perpetual peonage by the planter. The system is to advance credit at the plantation store, the amount of indebtedness to be subtracted from the amount due the tenant when the crop is in. The crop is never large enough to cancel the indebtedness which increases year by year. By Mississippi law, however, any disaster such as a flood which destroys the crop automatically cancels the indebtedness of the tenant to the landlord, so that the planter has no legal right to hold the tenant. Probably most of the tenants do not know of this fact. The objection they had to returning to the home plantation was made clear when the Red Cross announced that on a definite date in June the colored camp would be evacuated, all refugees to be returned to the plantations from which they came. That night the colored refugees took to the hills like frightened rabbits, and, in spite of the best efforts of the National Guard, many of them got safely away.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt should be understood that the enforced return of refugees to the planters against the will of the former was not according to the official Red Cross policy and, as has been stated, was not done in the case of white refugees. Official instructions definitely stated that no refugee was to be forced to return to a planter. However, transportation was only furnished to their homes—that is, to the place where they were living at the time of the flood. After the planter had sent for “his people” the refugees were notified and told to be ready to go on a definite date. If they protested they were asked what alternative plan they could suggest. Usually they had none, or a vague plan to go to some relatives. This was allowed only if they could show letters from the relatives stating that they were able to receive and care for them for an indefinite period. Needless to say, very few of them could produce such letters. The refugee was next told that the Red Cross would not furnish maintenance for him after it was possible for him to return home. Neither would he be allowed to leave camp without a definite destination approved by the Red Cross. If he still remained in camp, as he well knew, he would be “in bad” with the Red Cross and subject to special abuse by the National Guard. The result was that he ended by expressing his willingness to go with his planter; or else ran away from camp at night.\nThe Red Cross defense is that they did not create the social conditions in the South and it is not their function to reform them. All they can be expected to do is to relieve temporary suffering due to the disaster and leave the victim in the same position in which he was when the flood came. Anything more than this is not only considered beyond the scope of the organization but is held by most Red Cross workers as definitely bad work, almost amounting to mis-use of funds. Anyone familiar with this work has frequently heard the words, “Why, he is better off than he was before the disaster,” in a tone of horror that indicated more than the words just how reprehensible this was. It does not occur to the average Red Cross worker, apparently, that it is impossible to keep hands off from existing social institutions. They must, whether they wish or not, either strengthen or weaken them. Like many family welfare agencies, their instinctive stand is made with the strong, the powerful, rather than on the side of the weak.\nCooperating with the Red Cross were many agencies, the important one in the camps being the National Guard. Their work was to maintain order and sanitation, to police the camps and supervise the actual labor which, except in Camp Hayes, was done by the refugees. In the white camp the kitchen work and rougher tasks were done by Negroes from Camp Louisiana. They were unpaid with the exception of three men who were given fifty cents a day. The Guardsmen assigned all work to refugees at their own discretion and forced them to do it, by any means they saw fit. They also did sentry duty—no one was allowed to enter or leave camp without a pass. They had, in addition, to load the trucks with conscripted Negro labor which was sent out each morning to local enterprises in need of labor. At first this labor was unpaid but on May tenth an order was issued by General Green requiring all agencies desiring labor details from the refugee camps to submit their request twelve hours before the labor was desired, stating the number of Negroes wanted, the time when they were wanted, the time they would be returned to camp, and the rate of pay. After that date the men were paid from a dollar and a quarter to a dollar and a half a day for a ten hour day. They were rounded up early each morning by the Guardsmen assigned to that task. Only a certificate from the doctor stating that a man was too ill to work excused him. Such a certificate could be obtained by going to the clinic, which was held at ten o’clock each morning, for examination by the physician. By ten o’clock practically all the men in camp had gone to work. Those who were on the night shift were able to attend the clinic by sacrificing their sleep. Only the two colored nurses to whom they went for medicine knew the number of men who went to work each morning with temperatures as high as 104 degrees, or gripped by a malarial chill. At the Refuge Ware House, which employed the largest detail of conscripted labor, they were put at the heaviest Lind of work and were brutally ill-treated. “It ain’t the work,” said one of these refugees, “we’s willing to work. It’s the kickin’ and cursin’ makes it so hard.”\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOne of the hardest tasks of the Guard was that of getting out the labor detail night and morning. In spite of the fact that those who remained in camp were put at work there, cleaning up, putting up or taking down tents, filling in trenches, etc., and that they were paid for outside work, it was increasingly difficult to get the required number. Force had to be resorted to. As the guardsmen were of course armed with guns and pistols which they showed entire willingness to use it should have been comparatively simple, but on numerous occasions Negroes were taken down the hill and beaten into submission before they could be loaded on the truck and sent to their day’s labor. Reports of these beatings were made to General Green by colored citizens in Vicksburg, resulting in the following order to the Captain in charge at Camp Fort Hill:\n\nHeadquarters, Relief Expedition, Mississippi National Guard. \n  Office of the Commanding General, Vicksburg, Miss.\n  May 23rd, 1927.\n  Subject: Whipping of Refugees.\n  To: Captain F. L. Wright, 106th Eng., Camp Fort Hill.\n1. Report reaching these Headquarters by Attorney Ewing (col.) and Dr. Penson (col.), as follows: L. R. Ruben, Camp Fort Hill, whipped last week; Sheffield Collins, reported whipped on the 19th of May; 25 men whipped on May 20th. Witnesses, Wess Edwards, Mary Cortney, Gertis Simpson, Yerger Cortney, James Loston.  Another report, one woman whipped last week, taken to hospital, required seven stitches in her head.\n2. You will make an immediate investigation of the above cases and report in writing to this office the results of your investigation.\n  For the Commanding General:\n  G.B. Egger,  Lieut. Col., 155th Inf., Chief of Staff.\n\nIn compliance with this order Captain Wright “investigated” the matter. His report to the General is as follows:\n\nHeadquarters, Relief Expedition, Mississippi National Guard. \n  Office of the Commanding General, Vicksburg, Miss.\n  May 30, 1927.\n  Subject: Reported Whipping of Refugees in Camp Fort Hill.\n  To : The Commanding General, Vicksburg, Miss.\n1. I have investigated the above matter and find that on Friday morning, May 21st, 1927, it having been previously reported that refugees were leaving camp early in the morning in order to avoid being called on the different details necessary about the camp, the enlisted men in charge of details on this morning sent some men out beyond the guard posts for the purpose of catching any refugees leaving without authority, or a pass. On this particular morning they caught in the neighborhood of 25 negro men slipping out of camp; some of the negroes say that they counted 21 in the bunch. I have interviewed some of these negroes and attach hereto their statements, taken on last Monday. Some of the others I have talked to but at the time they were just leaving on the truck with a detail of laborers and I could not reduce their statements to writing and have them sign them. Each of the negroes, however, made practically the same statement. 2. It would appear from what the negroes say about the matter, that they were slipping out of camp; some admit for the purpose of avoiding the labor details and the work to be done about the camp, and some offering excuses as to why they were leaving through the bushes at 4:30 A. M. It is my opinion, from what the negroes say, that they were caught slipping out of camp, and were taken under the hill and whipped, the men using a strap taken off of one of the rifles. 3. It must be admitted, of course, that such measures should not be used by the soldiers, and it is my opinion that no such thing will ever occur again, and that had the men taken the time to consider, it would not have happened on this occasion, but if one is familiar with conditions, and considers for a moment what an undertaking it is for thirty odd soldiers to handle some five thousand people, then the enormity of the crime must be diminished, for under all conditions some means of discipline must be provided. No guns were drawn or held on the negroes, and no force was used to intimidate them, or force them to submit to the whipping. It was administered simply as a means of breaking up the practice of leaving camp without passes, and without any criminal intent. 4. None of the negroes reported the matter, and each of them state that they desire to prefer no charges, but desire that the matter be dropped.\nStatement of John Butler,\nGreenville, Miss.\nOn last Friday morning about 8 o’clock I was going down the Hill to Quarter Boat to get some clothes. I met some soldiers and they caught us and carried us up there and whipped us with a gun strap. I had been on night duty and was relieved when caught.\nI have not complained to any person about the affair. I did not have a pass to go out of camp and I was not going by the regular road.  \n  The morning after this affair another negro was severely beaten. The refugee was from another camp and protested against being sent to work by officers not in charge of his own camp. The matter being reported an investigation was ordered, which resulted in these statements made by the Captain, the Sergeant who administered the beating and the Negro girl who witnessed the alteration:\nInvestigation reveals that around 5:22 A. M., May 22, 1927, that the men getting out the morning labor detail found the said negro at a refugee negro girl’s tent in area I. The negro was apparently a Ft. Hill refugee attempting to keep from going out to work. He said to Sergeant Hamlin and to negro girl that he wasn’t going out to work, that he didn’t have to work. He was told to get on the truck. He finally gave so much sass and bray talk before the other laborers that he was taken over in the ravine and given a lashing.\nThis information was obtained from the negro girl and from Sergeant Hamlin.\nW. K. McWilliams, Capt., 106th Engrs.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe use of violence on the part of guardsmen toward Negro refugees was thoroughly established in the early days of the disaster. The work on the Vicksburg levee was entirely the enforced labor of Negro refugees, superintended by armed guardsmen. This was done by order of General Green, the labor to be brought from the colored refugee camps. There were many thousands of refugees in the town of Vicksburg who did not go into the camps. The entire colored population of the town lent their homes to the utmost capacity for the use of refugees, so that the tiniest cabin was filled to over-flowing. As long as these people were able to maintain themselves it was difficult to obtain their free labor. However, a way to do so was found.\nA cafeteria was maintained for the purpose of feeding the Negro labor brought from camp. Other refugees were not to be allowed to enter. In practice the soldier in charge allowed the town refugees to enter and be fed, then, as they were about to leave, they were seized and forced to join the labor detail. In at least one instance this practice led to shooting the refugee who objected to being coerced. The official report of this shooting is as follows:\n\nHeadquarters, Relief Expedition, Mississippi National Guard.\n  Vicksburg, Miss.\n  May 3, 1927.\n \nMayor W. J. Hosley, Vicksburg, Miss.\n  Dear Sir: In re: Shooting of Dunbar, a negro flood refugee.\nThis shooting occurred on May 1st, 1927, near A. & V. freight office. Dunbar was shot in the stomach and arm but has good chances for recovery. He was shot by Private Herbert K. Moore, 122nd Motor Transport Corps. Private Moore reported to Police Headquarters and was released on bond. Dunbar was sent to a hospital immediately after being shot.\nPrivate Moore was forced to shoot Dunbar to save his own life. Dunbar attacked him with a tent pin, struck him a severe blow across the face and attempted to take his pistol, threatening to take Private Moore’s life all the time. Private Moore took only such action as was necessary to protect his own life.\nThe facts of this affair have been given to Judge W. W. Ramsey, Police Justice, in detail. As soon as it is determined whether Dunbar will recover private Moore will be arraigned before Judge Ramsey on a proper charge so that there may be a judicial determination of his guilt or innocence. Of course, this can not be done until it is certain that Dunbar will recover or until he dies.\nJudge Ramsey agrees that Private Moore should be allowed to continue at large under bond already given until time for his trial.\nVery respectfully yours,  Captain, J. A. G.\n\nIt will be noticed that the only man interviewed in this “investigation” was Private Moore. At the time this report was made, although the Captain does not state this, it was uncertain that Dunbar would recover. In case he did not this left nothing to contradict the self-defense story; while if he did recover no serious charge would be brought.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt is doubtful whether a self-defense plea would have served in the case of Matilda Heslip, a colored woman at Camp Fort Hill, had she shot the soldier who struck her with a stick the exact size of the one with which Dunbar struck the guardsman. Her offense was the unforgivable one of impudence. It happened that a soldier was leaving on the noon train and he told Matilda Heslip to wash and iron his clothes before he went. She objected that it would be impossible to get the garments dried and ironed in that time. The man ordered her to dry them in the kitchen before the stove. Her attempt to do this led to a row with the kitchen forces. The sergeant was sent for to settle the dispute. The testimony follows:\nOn May 12, about 11 A. M., at Fort Hill, a negro woman named Matilda Heslip was raising a disturbance in the kitchen and the negroes working there could not quiet her. Sergeant McIntyre of “C” 106th Engrs. was sent for by the kitchen force to quiet the fuss. He found upon entering that the woman had washed some clothes and was trying to dry them before the stove. This occurred at the time when it was necessary to have room for the preparation of the noon meal. The woman had been asked to move by the kitchen force but would pay no attention to them. Sergeant McIntyre ordered her to move and she refused. He left to get a cot stick with which to protect himself if it became necessary when the woman ran, leaving the clothes scattered about the kitchen. Sergeant McIntyre ordered her to return and get the clothes. She refused and also advised him that no one could make her do it. Her language was so insulting and impudent that it was necessary to use force in order to preserve discipline among the colored refugees so necessary to a successful handling of these camps. The woman was struck about the arm with a cot stick and she was also hit on the head. It was necessary to take three stitches in her head.\nWitnesses: Sgt. McIntyre, Sgt. White, Pvt. Waxon.\nImpudence is a sin which cannot be forgiven in a Negro. Sheffield Collins, a young colored boy, was so impudent as to refuse to box to amuse the soldiers. He was also accused of stealing the oranges which were sent for free distribution among the refugees. The soldiers, by the way, helped themselves liberally to the oranges which were donated to the refugees, so that if anyone could be said to “steal” it was surely they rather than the refugee. Here is the statement Sheffield Collins is reported to have made:\n\nStatement of Sheffield Collins,\n104 Lake Street, Greenville, Miss.\nI, the undersigned, a refugee from Greenville, Miss., on last Friday morning was told to box another Negro boy by one of the soldiers on duty at Fort Hill. I replied that I did not want to box because my Mother had told me not to. This soldier told me that he was going to make me box because I had stolen some oranges. I had two oranges in my pocket that I had gotten out of the basket where they had been thrown away. One of the soldiers then said, “Go and get a case of oranges and make him eat them all,” but Col. Tom Shaw pulled the gloves off of me and carried me down the hill, took my belt off and whipped me with it.\nI have had the above statement read to me and it is true and correct.\nSheffield Collins.\n\n\nStatement of Tom Shaw, Guardsman,\nCamp Fort Hill,\nMay 14, 1927.\nI put the gloves on him and asked him if he was going to box and he told me “Hell, no,” and he was not going to box anybody. For two or three days he had been refusing to do anything I asked him to do. He was also very impudent about it, so I took him down under the hill and gave him a whipping, not because he would not box but because he was so impudent and had been so for several days. And also because he had been stealing oranges and I took oranges out of his pockets several times. On this occasion he had two in his pocket, and oranges had already been issued to him before this time. His quota for the day was one orange, and he had eaten it. The two he had then was stolen. I hit him about five licks with his belt and he was not in any way injured. It is necessary to use some such means of punishment in order to keep order and discipline in the camp.\nTom Shaw.\n\nIn connection with the oranges contributed for the disaster sufferers is an interesting incident. Captain Moser, then the commanding officer at Camp Louisiana, ordered a truckload of these oranges (which were being distributed free) to be dumped into a ravine and buried. Capt. Moser said they were unfit for consumption. This was denied at the time by a number of enlisted men. Capt. Moser was at the time running the canteen at Camp Louisiana, in the success of which he had a personal interest. He sold oranges in this canteen and the enlisted men gossipped about this coincidence.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUnder an officer of this type it cannot be wondered at that abuses ot all kinds flourished. Drunkenness on duty was common. Bootleg whiskey was easily obtainable by the simple expedient of trading for it quantities of Red Cross supplies from the kitchens. Guardsmen were accused of having insulted and attempted assault upon colored women. Upon “investigation” these accusations were reported as having no foundation in fact. The stories continued to be whispered and detailed accounts given. Protests were made by private citizens who had their facts from the conversation of the guardsmen themselves. Nothing was established and no action was taken.\nOfficers such as Capt. Moser seem to have been the rule. An exception was Lieut. May who was placed in charge at Camp Hayes early in June. The change in camp life after he took charge was so instant and complete that everyone who saw it remarked upon it for weeks afterward. Camp was “cleaned up” in every way. Reasonable rules were enforced. Arbitrary and unnecessary rules were changed or abolished. From a noisy, unsanitary confusion camp Hayes became a clean, quiet and pleasant place. Had such an officer as Lieut. May been in charge of the colored camps it is possible that even there the worst abuses would have been discontinued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nFlood (1927)\nThe Flood, the Red Cross and the National Guard (1928)\nOfficers (1917)\nSoldiers (1920)\nThe Migration (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “The Flood, the Red Cross and the National\nGuard.” The Crisis 35 (1): 5--7, 26, 28. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/01/the_flood_the_red_cross_and_the_national_guard.html."

    "text": "Nothing more unfortunate has happened in the recent history of the Negro race than the attitude of black ministers in Washington toward Clarence Darrow. Here is a man whose voice has been raised for righteousness in the face of flattery, money and fame. He has dared to use his unique genius to defend the rights of poor white labor and disfranchised Negroes. While the Christian Church stands silent, he speaks. When an appeal to the organized religion of the United States brings no audible response, Clarence Darrow goes down into the blood and dust of battle to defend the lost cause.\nIf religion and Christianity mean anything, they mean deeds and not the mere words. And yet, the black ministers of Washington are apparently more interested in the mouthing of creeds and the orthodoxy of men’s beliefs than in the Christianity and unselfishness of their deeds. There is not a Negro church in the United States that ought not to throw wide its doors to Clarence Darrow and beg him to come in. He will criticize those churches, and they ought to be criticized. He says frankly and openly what their own members say, namely: They are spending too much money for church edifices, and not enough for the social uplift which Christianity stands for, if it stands for anything.\nWhenever religion forgets its high calling of inspiring faith in human beings, peace instead of war, unselfishness instead of greed, and deeds instead of words; and turns to heresy hunting, it brings on itself the contempt of mankind. The Negro Church in the past has been sewn with superstition and worldliness, but it has always been able to say in its own defense, We believe in man; and in the lowest of men; We open our doors to the despised and hunted; We extend our charity to all forms and faith.\nIt will be a sad time, and the beginning of its doom when the black church turns from this its highest mission and goes to burning witches.\n\nClarence Darrow does not believe many things that Orthodox Christians believe; but he respects the beliefs of any sincere person and in turn he deserves respect for his own honest opinions. If the Negro race is going to start hunting Heretics, let it pause and remember that William Lloyd Garrison, Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass were nearly as radical religious freethinkers as Clarence Darrow. Nor let them forget that the greatest of religious rebels once said to a bunch of pettifogging defenders of the letter of the law: “Woe unto you scribes and Pharisee, hypocrites, that strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!”\n\nWhat difference does it make whether the whale swallowed Jonah or Jonah swallowed the whale, so long as Justice, Mercy and Peace prevail?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe White Church (1917)\nThe Fruit of the Tree (1913)\nThe Church and the Negro (1913)\nA Statement (1919)\nDodging the Issue (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Darrow.” The Crisis 35 (6):\n203. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/06/darrow.html."

    "text": "Nella Larsen “Quicksand” (Knopf) Claude McKay “Home to Harlem” (Harper and Brothers)\nI have just read the last two novels of Negro America. The one I liked; the other I distinctly did not. I think that Mrs. Imes, writing under the pen name of Nella Larsen, has done a fine, thoughtful and courageous piece of work in her novel. It is, on the whole, the best piece of fiction that Negro America has produced since the heyday of Chesnutt, and stands easily with Jessie Fauset’s “There is Confusion,” in its subtle comprehension of the curious cross currents that swirl about the black American.\nClaude McKay’s “Home to Harlem,” on the other hand, for the most part nauseates me, and after the dirtier parts of its filth I feel distinctly like taking a bath. This does not mean that the book is wholly bad. McKay is too great a poet to make any complete failure in writing. There are bits of “Home to Harlem,” beautiful and fascinating: the continued changes upon the theme of the beauty of colored skins; the portrayal of the fascination of their new yearnings for each other which Negroes are developing. The chief character, Jake, has something appealing, and the glimpses of the Haitian, Ray, have all the materials of a great piece of fiction.\nBut it looks as though, despite this, McKay has set out to cater for that prurient demand on the part of white folk for a portrayal in Negroes of that utter licentiousness which conventional civilization holds white folk back from enjoying—if enjoyment it can be called. That which a certain decadent section of the white American world, centered particularly in New York, longs for with fierce and unrestrained passions, it wants to see written out in black and white, and saddled on black Harlem. This demand, as voiced by a number of New York publishers, McKay has certainly satisfied, and added much for good measure. He has used every art and emphasis to paint drunkenness, fighting, lascivious sexual promiscuity and utter absence of restraint in as bold and as bright colors as he can.\nIf this had been done in the course of a well-conceived plot or with any artistic unity, it might have been understood if not excused. But “Home to Harlem” is padded. Whole chapters here and there are inserted with no connection to the main plot, except that they are on the same dirty subject. As a picture of Harlem life or of Negro life anywhere, it is, of course, nonsense. Untrue, not so much as on account of its facts, but on account of its emphasis and glaring colors. I am sorry that the author of “Harlem Shadows” stooped to this. I sincerely hope that he will some day rise above it and give us in fiction the strong, well-knit as well as beautiful theme, that it seems to me he might do.\nNella Larsen on the other hand has seized an interesting character and fitted her into a close yet delicately woven plot. There is no “happy ending” and yet the theme is not defeatist like the work of Peterkin and Green. Helga Crane sinks at last still master of her whimsical, unsatisfied soul. In the end she will be beaten down even to death but she never will utterly surrender to hypocrisy and convention. Helga is typical of the new, honest, young fighting Negro woman—the one on whom “race” sits negligibly and Life is always first and its wandering path is but darkened, not obliterated by the shadow of the Veil. White folk will not like this book. It is not near nasty enough for New York columnists. It is too sincere for the South and middle West. Therefore, buy it and make Mrs. Imes write many more novels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Younger Literary Movement (1924)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nNegro Writers (1920)\nMencken (1927)\nThe Capital N (1930)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “Two Novels.” The Crisis 35\n(6): 202. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/06/two_novels.html."

    "text": "For the American Negro this has without doubt been the most humiliating presidential campaign through which he has passed. The agreement and accord of the two leading parties in regard to him has at last become perfect and complete.\nTentative gropings toward accord date back to 1876 when under the plea of healing the wounds of Civil War, the Federal Government decided to give up all attempt at supervising national elections. This put the nation in the humiliating position of having almost no control over the voters who elect its officials. From this compromise, we moved forward during a long period when it was the recognized function of the Republican Party to deplore disfranchisement and assert stoutly its intention to defend the rights of American Negroes in all ways. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, took a position which accepted responsibility for Negro disfranchisement and made it the declared enemy of Negro advancement.\nAs time went on, the indignation of Republican platforms cooled to a perfunctory declaration against the most outrageous of abuses, lynching, while the Democratic platform became silent because of the bid of Northern and Border state Democrats for Negro votes. The Republicans, however, proceeded to disfranchise Southern representatives in the party convention, and made repeated effort to transfer the control of the Republican Party in the South entirely to the hands of white men. The Democratic party, in the South by indirect and sometimes by positive action, aided and abetted these so-called Lily-White Republicans and threatened revolt if Northern Democrats treated with Negroes.\nComplete understanding came in the campaign of 1928. So far as possible Hoover overthrew every Negro political leader in the South, and made statements which the South interpreted as A promise to appoint no Negroes to office. The Democrats, on the other hand, even in the North, refrained sedulously from making any bid for the Negro vote.\nThe result of this is that the political strategy which thoughtful Negro voters have been pursuing for sixteen years comes to naught. Their ideal was political independence, which involved breaking away from customary subserviency to the Republicans, and placing their votes at the disposition of either party, which bade fair from its record and its promises to secure them the largest increase of citizenship rights.\nWhen, now, neither party makes any promises whatsoever, or any bid for the Negro vote; when both parties acquiesce in attacks of racial bigotry and assertions which show their utter contempt and indifference to the Negro voter, the Negro is compelled to seek a new political program.\nHe may as well give up immediately any thought of inducing either the Republicans or Democrats to favor any administrative action or legislation which will decrease the exploitation of Negro labor, the disfranchisement of Negro political power, or which will condemn the use of race hatred to influence and sway the ignorant proletariat and the self-satisfied snobs of the nation. With unswerving determination and careful planning, the Negro must prepare to throw his whole political influence with a Third Party.\nThe Negro must ask as the price of his support of such a party: (1) the enforcement of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, (2) Federal supervision of Federal elections, (3) the distribution of political power, based on the number of votes actually cast, and not simply on the population, (4) the socialization of wealth and income, so as to protect the interests of the poor laborer against the political power of the rich investor.\nTwo incidents in this campaign give hope of success for this new political alignment. The first is the number of other groups who find themselves politically homeless: the women, the liberal white South, organized Labor, the Pacifists, and the Farmers are all politically dressed up with nowhere to go. They cannot even get a chance to vote against the thing they fear and hate. The second note of encouragement which comes is the unity of opinion shown by the Appeal to America which was sent out during the campaign. Never before in the history of the United States have American Negro leaders shown so great uniformity on matters fundamental to their civilization and advance. Starting with this and leaving the Valley of Humiliation behind us, let us climb forward to real and definite political power for twelve million Americans of Negro descent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVote (1924)\nThe Election (1914)\nPolitical Straws (1923)\nHow Shall We Vote (1920)\nThe Election (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1928. “The Campaign of 1928.”\nThe Crisis 35 (12): 418. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/35/12/campaign_of_1928.html."

    "text": "From the time I entered High School at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in 1880, I have had the itch to edit something. The first fruition was a school paper, in manuscript, called the “High School Howler,” edited by me and illustrated by Art Benham, who could draw caricatures. It had as I remember but one issue.\nMy next effort was while I was a student at Fisk University and I became, first, exchange editor and then editor of the Fisk Herald, during my junior and senior years, 1887-1888.\nThe next adventure was the monthly called The Moon, which was published by Harry Pace and Edward Simon in Memphis and edited by me in Atlanta in 1906. From 1907 to 1910, I was joint editor of a miniature magazine, published monthly in Washington, D. C. My co-laborers were H. M. Hershaw and F. H. M. Murray.\nIn 1910, I came to New York as Director of Publications and Research in the NAACP. The idea was that I should continue the kind of research into the Negro problem that I had been carrying on in Atlanta and that eventually I should become Secretary of the NAACP. But I did not want to raise money, and there were no funds for research; so that from the first, I urged that we have a monthly organ.\nThis seemed necessary because the chief Negro weekly The New York Age was then owned by friends of Mr. Washington, and the Tuskegee organization had tight hold of most of the rest of the Negro press. The result was that the NAACP got a pretty raw deal from the colored press and none at all from the white papers.\nIn addition to that the Negro press was at the time mainly organs of opinion and not gatherers of news."

    "text": "No Capital\nBut there again the matter of money was difficult. It was hard enough to raise the salaries of our two executive officers, and certainly we had no capital for investment in a periodical. I was persistent and two persons helped me: Mary Maclean, an English woman who was a writer on the New York Times and a loyal and efficient friend; and Robert N. Wood, a printer who was head of the Negro Tammany organization at that time.\nWood knew about printing and I knew nothing. He advised me, helped me to plan the magazine, and took the risk of getting me credit for paper and printing. The Board agreed that it would be responsible for debts up to but not exceeding $50.00 a month. It has always been a matter of pride to me that I never asked for that $50.00.\nFinally after what seemed to me interminable delays on various accounts, the first number of The Crisis appeared in November, 1910. It had sixteen 5x8 pages, with a cover which carried one little woodcut of a Negro child; as one of my critics facetiously said: “It is a shame to take the ten cents which this issue costs.”\nFirst because of the news which it contained, in 4 pages of “Along the Color Line”; then because of some blazing editorials which continually got us into hot water with friends and foes; and because of the pictures of Negroes which we carried in increasing number and often in color, The Crisis succeeded.\nWe condensed more news about Negroes and their problems in a month than most colored papers before this had published in a year. Then we had four pages of editorials, which talked turkey. The articles were at first short and negligible but gradually increased in number, length, and importance; but we were never able to pay contributors. Pictures of colored people were an innovation; and at that time it was the rule of most white papers never to publish a picture of a colored person except as a criminal and the colored papers published mostly pictures of celebrities who sometimes paid for the honor. In general the Negro race was just a little afraid to see itself in plain ink."

    "text": "Circulation Growth\nThe circulation growth of The Crisis was extraordinary, even to us who believed in it. From a monthly net paid circulation of 9,000 copies in 1911, it jumped to 75,000 copies in 1918, and from an income of $6,500 to an income of $57,000. In January 1916, The Crisis became entirely self-supporting, paying all items of its cost including publicity, light, heat, rent, etc., and the salaries of an editor and business manager and nine clerks. It circulated in every state in the union, in all the insular possessions, and in most foreign countries including Africa.\nWe doubled the size of the tiny first issue in December, 1910. We increased the number of pictures, trying two-color jobs on the cover in 1911 and three colors in 1912, 1917-1918. Our special education and children’s numbers began in 1914. From time to time we issued special numbers on localities like Chicago and New Orleans; on “Votes for Women” and the pageant “Star of Ethiopia.”\n\nIndispensable Persons\nDuring this period two persons were indispensable in the conduct of The Crisis: Mary Maclean, editorial assistant, who died in harness and worked without pay; and Augustus Dill, business manager, who organized a model office. In November, 1919, Jessie Fauset became literary editor and gave us inestimable help for seven years. Mattie Allison and Lottie Jarvis as secretaries, and Hazel Branch as head of the clerical staff, helped make an ideal family. Frank Turner was our bookkeeper from 1910 until the NAACP took him over in 1922.\nWe reached a circulation of 100,000 in 1919, following my revelation of the attitude of American army officers toward the Negroes in France. I shall never forget the circumstances of that scoop. I was in the office of Blaise Diagne in the spring of 1919. Diagne was a tall, thin, black Senegalese, French Under-Secretary of State for Colonies, and during the war, French Commissioner in West Africa, out-ranking the Colonial Governor. Diagne saved France by the black shock troops which he brought from Africa and threw against German artillery. They held the Germans until the Allies could get ready for them.\nDiagne was consequently a great man and it was his word which induced Prime Minister Clemenceau to let the First Pan-African Congress meet in Paris against the advice of the Americans. Diagne did not like white Americans.\n“Did you see,” he stormed, “what the American Mission told the French about the way Negroes should be treated?” Then he showed me the official document. I read it and sat very still. Then I said, as carelessly as possible, “Would it be possible to obtain a copy of this?” “Take that,” said Diagne.\nHaving the precious document, the problem was what do with it. I dare not carry it nor trust it to the mails. But a white friend who was sailing home offered to take anything I wished to send. I handed him the document sealed, neglecting to say what dynamite was in it. The Crisis office and NAACP officials read it and dropped it until I returned. I published it in May, 1919. The Post Office promptly held the Crisis up in the mails. But it proved too hot for them; if the Government held it that would be acknowledging its authorship. They let it go. We sold 100,000 copies!\n\n\nHigh-Water Mark\nOur income in 1920, was $77,000. That was our high-water mark. Then began a slump which brought the circulation down to 35,000 copies in 1924 and a cash income of $46,000. The causes of this were clear and strike every modern periodical: the reading public is not used to paying for the cost of the periodicals which they read; often they do not pay even for the cost of the paper used in the edition. Advertisers pay for most of the costs and advertisers buy space in periodicals which circulate widely among well-to-do persons able to buy the wares offered. The Crisis was known to circulate among Negro workers of low income. Moreover, it antagonized many white powerful interests; it had been denounced in Congress and many respectable Negroes were afraid to be seen reading it. Mississippi passed laws against it and some of our agents were driven from home.\nWe got some advertising, especially from Negro businesses; some advertisers we refused because we did not like the wares they offered or suspected fraud. The “Big” advertisers remained aloof; some looked us over, but nearly all fell back on the rule not to patronize “propaganda” periodicals. Beside they did not believe the Negro market worth entering.\nOur only recourse was to raise our price of subscription. In December 1919 we raised our price to a dollar and a half for a year and fifteen cents a copy; also we increased our size to 64 pages and cover. This might have extricated us if the prices of everything else had not gone up, while wages went down. The depression which burst on the nation in 1929, started among Negro workers as early as 1926. It struck the workers of the Negro race long before the country in general dreamed of it. I remember bringing the matter to the attention of the president of the board of directors, but he said “the country is unusually prosperous!” Nevertheless, I retorted, the Negro worker is losing old jobs and not getting new ones.\n\n\nOpinion or Propaganda\nThere was a wider underlying cause: How far was The Crisis an organ of opinion and propaganda; and of whose opinion and just what propaganda? Or how far was it an organ of an association catering to its immediate plans and needs? The two objects and methods were not incompatible with each other in the earlier days of beginnings. Indeed from 1910 to 1925 or later The Crisis was the predominant partner, with income and circulation larger than the income and membership of the NAACP. For just this reason the NAACP became known outside its membership, and with the energetic work of Shillady, Johnson, and White, the membership and income increased and the question of the future relation of The Crisis and the NAACP had to be settled. Their complete separation was proposed; or if the income of The Crisis continued to fall, the subsidy of The Crisis by the NAACP; or further attempt to prolong the present relations and increase The Crisis income and circulation.\nFrom 1925 to 1934, the latter method was tried. Various efforts were made to increase The Crisis circulation, by change of form and content. Considerable success ensued, but the depression which now fell heavier on the nation, convinced me that The Crisis could not be made to pay again for a long period and that meantime the only way to keep it alive was by subsidy from the NAACP. For this reason in 1934, I gave up my position as editor and publisher of The Crisis and went back to teaching and writing at Atlanta University.\nIn the nature of the case, there is a clear distinction between an organ of an organization and a literary magazine. They have different objects and functions. The one is mainly a series of reports and records of organizational technicalities and news notes of methods and routine notices. All large organizations need such a publication. But it is never self-supporting nor widely read. So far as it tries to be literary and artistic, it misses its main function and is too narrow to achieve any other.\n\n\nFree Lance or Nothing\nOn the other hand, a literary and news journal must be free and uncontrolled; in no other way can it be virile, creative, and individual. While it must follow an ideal, and one of which one or more organizations approve, yet its right to deviate in particulars must be granted, else it misses its function of provoking thought, stimulating argument, and attracting readers. For many years the NAACP gave me such freedom and the public repaid them and me by wide support. But when public support lagged and the NAACP must furnish a large part of the supporting funds, it would have called for more faith than any organization was likely to have in one man, to leave me still in untrammeled control. And as for me, I had no interest in a conventional organ; I must be Free Lance or nothing.\nAgainst, therefore, the strong pleas of close friends like Joel Spingarn; and against the openly expressed wish of the whole Board, which did not wholly agree with me, but were willing to yield much to retain me, I resigned. And I resigned completely and not in part. I was not only editor and head of a department which was separate from that of the Executive Secretary, with my own office and staff and separate bank account; I was also one of the incorporators of the NAACP and member of the Board of Directors since its beginning. Its officials from the first had come to consideration and election on my recommendation. I was a member of the Spingarn Medal Committee, and chief speaker at every annual conference. It was fair to say that the policy of the NAACP from 1910 to 1934 was largely of my making.\nI would not have been honest therefore with my successors to have resigned in part and hung on to remnants of my former power. I went out completely. I think some sighed in relief. But many were genuinely sorry. Among the latter was myself. For I was leaving my dream and brainchild; my garden of hope and highway to high emprise. But I was 65; my life work was practically done. I looked forward to a few final years of thought, advice and remembrance, beneath the trees and on the hills beside the graves and with the friends where first my real life-work had begun in 1897.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBooming The Crisis (1914)\nWe Come of Age (1915)\nThe New Crisis (1925)\nNegro Writers (1920)\nThe Colored Magazine in America (1912)"

They lead to the Negro quarter and three Negroes are arrested. Two of them are discharged but the other is held. On March 18 a mob of 2,000 attack the City Hall in order to lynch this black man. The mob damages the City Hall, loots stores and chases Negroes. Twenty or more Negroes arm themselves and gather in a pool room. Two of their leaders, Anderson and Ford, shoot into the mob and check it, although themselves desperately wounded. They are now under arrest and on trial for “inciting to riot.” Finally, the National Guard of the state is called out to guard the frenzied town. Eighteen white persons are arrested for rioting but all are discharged except one.\nMeantime, the colored man arrested is released when the girls declare he was not guilty. Then the city awakes from its orgy. Colored people offer rewards aggregating $423 to find the rapists. Afterward, the white officials offer $2,200 in rewards. Forty-five thousand dollars in damage suits are filed against the city and others are still to come.\nThen the truth begins to leak out. The white people try to hush the matter up but the Negroes petition for a Grand Jury. The Coffeeville Daily Journal acknowledges, May 30, that white men and not Negroes were the bedfellows of the two girls and one white man is today in jail charged with rape while one of the girls is also in jail as accessory.

We Negroes who take our thinking from provincial New York and who in darkest Mississippi and environs are dumb and blind perforce to the great movements of the world are being led to think that the Western demand for the protection and financial relief of farmers is nonsense—the Bloc devil raised against the Great God Party. But wait: remember that the tillers of the soil have always been exploited; always the dumb, driven cattle who filled the fat bellies of the rich merchants, kept the artisans from starvation and starved themselves. Well we the black peasants of sugar, rice, tobacco, corn and cotton know that. Why are we poor? Because the things we raise are filched from us for a song or a kick and sold at prices which enrich everybody but the farmer. When as in Germany and Austria great Agrarian parties have arisen to wresk a part of the loot from Commerce and Industry, it has been the land monopolists and not the ragged peasants who have gained. But because of the land policy of the United States in the West during the 19th Century a New Farmer has arisen: a farmer who owns his one hundred sixty acres, can read and write and think and who knows that in the past every human endeavor has received government aid except farming; toward farming we have the primitive psychology which is determined to exploit to the limit the man who raises food and clothes for the sake of the man who eats and dresses. “No,” says the Western American farmer. “This profit which makes millionaires of manufacturers and bankers is hereafter going to be divided in some part with us who feed and shelter them. Stand by us, Labor, and don’t let them subtract our just share from your all too low wages.”\nThe only rift in the lute is that the Southern Farmer cannot stand shoulder to shoulder with the West, for he is a land monopolist and slave driver whose history makes him the tool of Commerce and Industry.\nBut let the black peasants and laborers lift up their ears to the meaning of the Farm Bloc and the McNary-Haugen Bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWork for Black Folk in 1914 (1914)\nThe Fruit of the Tree (1913)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nEugene Debs (1926)\nOur Class Struggle (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Farmers.” The Crisis 34\n(2): 69. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/34/02/farmers.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The most sinister thing about the Hampton strike, is not the attitude of the authorities of Hampton. It has long been known, and the knowledge discounted among American Negroes, that Hampton trustees and teachers did not all have feelings, opinions or ideals toward American Negroes, which were acceptable to self-respecting black men. There has always been at Hampton a degree of race discrimination and of repression that has been hateful and exasperating. It has long been endured, just as beggars often endure the insult of impudent almsgiving. The time for an end to that endurance is surely at hand, unless we Negroes are willing to bring up our children in the same attitude of subserviency and uncomplaining submission to caste which our fathers inherited from slavery. The Hampton attitude must be distinctly and firmly repudiated.\nBut the most disconcerting thing in the Hampton strike is the way in which graduates and parents repudiated their own children. The best of schools is imperfect. The worse is intolerable. The students present upon the grounds are in the long run the best and only judges of the efficiency of the education offered. They are far better judges than parents or alumni. If mature college students believe that a school is going wrong, what are they going to do but openly protest? In any white northern college that protest would immediately be heeded, even if accompanied by violence, and there would not be any silly insistance upon dumb, unthinking obedience. Students are not sent to school to learn to obey. They are sent there to learn to do, to think, to execute, to be men and women. Self-reliance, self-expression, honesty and decision are to be learned in school if anywhere. We complain bitterly of the lack of these qualities in our young people, but do we encourage their development? At Fisk and at Hampton there were parents and alumni who turned upon their own children like wild beasts, ready to beat them into submission; insisting that even if the school authorities were wrong, it was the business of black boys and girls to submit. At Hampton, the Alumni actually published to the world a statement; declaring, first, that they gave complete approval and consent to what the Hampton authorities had done, including the wholesale suspensions, and then, finally, promising that they would investigate.\nNegro colleges with few exceptions are standing together to punish and penalize for life and exclude from all chances of education the brave, orderly and clear-headed young men and women who led the Hampton strike, just because Hampton tells them to.\nAt this rate, what will the next generation be? What kind of crawling cowards are we seeking to spawn? It is possible, indeed, it is probable, that striking students at Hampton, Fisk, Shaw, Howard and elsewhere, have made their mistakes, but there is absolutely no question or shadow of doubt but that when 400 students, well-trained, orderly, with excellent records, are willing to take their future in their hands and jeopardize their whole lives in an appeal to the world for justice, that something must be absolutely and radically wrong, and the business of parents and Alumni is to investigate before they condemn, to encourage and uphold their protesting children, instead of cowing and disgracing them. It is the Principal and Faculty of Hampton that are really at the bar of Justice and not the students who refused to sing for the entertainment of a white Englishman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHampton (1918)\nRadicals (1919)\nLoyalty (1917)\nLight (1912)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “The Hampton Strike.”\nThe Crisis 34 (10): 347–48. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/34/10/hampton_strike.html."

It is not an attempt to unite existing organizations in an impossible federation for which there is neither demand nor need. It is not an attempt to form a new organization. It is a simple, straight-forward effort to ascertain facts and to take stock.\nThere has been too little of this kind of meeting. We are so anxious to right our wrongs that we usually do not have time to find out just what the wrongs are. We want more work and better wages, but what work are we doing and what wages are we receiving? We want to go into business, but what business are we conducting at present and how successfully? We want to spread banking and insurance, but what is the condition of our banks and insurance societies today? We complain of the lack of religious belief, but what are our churches doing to foster it? We inveigh against disfranchisement, but how far are we really disfranchised? We demand education, but what chances for education have we now? We periodically “die out,” but what is the real condition of our health? We are astonished at Negro crime, but how much Negro crime is there?\nAll these questions, this Conference seeks to answer: first by hearing a documentory report on present conditions, prepared by an expert; and second, by hearing just what organized work is doing to better conditions; and then with these facts, the Conference is debating the question of improving the work of existing organizations; of indicating further work; and pointing out the necessity, if any, of further organization.\nSuch a conference is distinctly worth-while.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Races in Conference (1910)\nDoes Organization Pay?

    "text": "E. B. Reuter’s “The American Race Problem” (Thomas Y. Crowell and Company) 448 pages, is a book designed for schools and colleges and is a characteristic piece of current academic writing. Reuter has read all the chief books on the Negro and a large amount of periodical literature. He knows current prejudices. He has collected in his book the opinions and statements on which most authorities agree; in matters where there is no standard opinion Reuter features his own. The result is that one finds here a good compendium of what other people have said, but no conclusions from Mr. Reuter that are worth repeating. Most of his conclusions are, in accordance with dominating prejudices, correctly pessimistic. “The presence of Negroes perverted the democratic social institutions”; (page 118.) “The race is not at present in need of or in a position to support a greatly increased number of professionals” (page 249.) “The total number of real educated Negroes in the country is not sufficient to make a faculty for one first class college” (page 289.) “The body of artistic accomplishment to date is small and for the most part not of a high order” (page 306.) “The masses of the race are uneducated and the majority grossly ignorant and backward” (page 335.) And finally, “Prejudice is a reality in the racial situation. It is not less real and probably not less permanent than the physical marks of race!” (page 432.)\nAs a partial balance to this sort of talk, Reuter acknowledges that there is no proof of the racial inferiority of the Negro; that there is great cultural diversity among them; that poverty has decreased; that their health has improved and that their sex standards and moral life show “remarkable” advance.\nThe trouble, of course, with a book of this sort is that the writer is not a human being and is not acquainted with human beings. He is studying books and statistics with the usual result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nToward a New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nA Statement (1919)\nVital Statistics (1912)\nRadicals (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Browsing Reader - The American Race\nProblem.” The Crisis 34 (7): 226. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/34/07/browsing_reader.html."

Recently, together with three other professional men, he made a trip to the biennial meeting of a colored fraternity in Detroit. They took the “Red Arrow” all Pullman train out of Washington. As they were talking in the smoking room, a porter came in.\n“A doctor, a doctor,” he cried. “There is a lady dying in my car! Is there a doctor in here?”\nMy friend pointed to Dr. Dumas of Washington, one of his companions. Dr. Dumas is tall and handsome, with a smooth, dark-brown face. He is a skilled physician and surgeon. He rose immediately, got his medicine case and went into the next Pullman. An elderly Southern white woman had eaten too much and had a dangerous attack of acute indigestion. A hypodermic relieved her and Dr. Dumas came back to his companions. The next morning, he sauntered back to the car and found the woman quite recovered. She thanked him; then she reached down in her valise, took out a ten dollar bill. Dr. Dumas bowed courteously.\n“O, no, Madam,” he said. “This is my vacation and yours was an emergency case. I cannot think of taking a fee.”\nThe woman insisted and got quite excited about it. But Dr. Dumas firmly refused and went back to his car. After a while a young white man came in. He said: “I am the son of Senator —, of —. I want to thank you very much for refusing to take that fee. The old woman in there is raising a great deal of excitement and is very angry. Of course you know what the trouble is. She thinks your refusal of a fee makes you assume to be her social equal and she is angry at any such assumption on your part. I am glad you did it. Some of the older generation of us Southerners are just plain fools. We younger people cannot, of course, get rid of all our prejudice, but we are certainly going to get rid of some.” He bowed and went out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSocial Equality (1911)\nPrecept and Practice (1910)\nConsolation (1916)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nA Matter of Manners (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Social Equals.” The Crisis\n34 (9): 312. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/34/09/social_equals.html."

There can be no question of H. L. Mencken’s attitude toward Negroes. It is calmly and judiciously fair. He neither loves nor hates them. He has a predilection for men.\nBut he, like many other Americans, does not understand just where the shoe pinches. When American artists of Negro descent have work worth while he believes that they are not barred by magazines or publishers. Of course not. But the point is that the themes on which Negro writers naturally write best, with deepest knowledge and clearest understanding, are precisely the themes which most editors do not want treated. These are themes which white readers are tired of or do not wish to hear. What is the “freedom” cry to a white American or “discrimination”? He is fed up on this which is the breath of life to black folk. While the feelings of insulted men, their reaction to the color line — well this he will not read about. Consequently the chief reading public in America will not buy precisely the sort of thing that Negroes must write about if they are sincere and honest.\nWhite Americans are willing to read about Negroes, but they prefer to read about Negroes who are fools, clowns, prostitutes, or at any rate, in despair and contemplating suicide. Other sorts of Negroes do not interest them because, as they say, they are “just like white folks.” But their interest in white folks, we notice, continues. This is a real and tremendous handicap. It is analogous to the handicap of all writers on unpopular themes; but it bears hardest on young Negroes because its bar is broader and more inclusive. It puts a premium on one kind of sadistic subject.\nDespite this, Mr. Mencken does not realize all that has been done. If the really first rate books written by Negroes since the Civil War make “a shelf a foot long,” that is a matter of congratulation. Similar notable works by white Americans would be a good deal less than nine feet long. In music, Nathaniel Dett has given the Negro spiritual another form and Harry Burleigh has done more than reproduce it. W. C. Handy is father of the “Blues.” Coleridge-Taylor, if we may be permitted a journey overseas, stands manifestly the great creative artist with his “Bamboula” and “Take Nabandji”; and there is Roland Hayes—is he not an artist? There may, of course, be difference of opinion about Negro poets, but in our opinion Paul Laurence Dunbar, Claude McKay, Countée Cullen and Langston Hughes stand far above “second rate.” We are inclined too to think that Chesnutt’s novels are far above “the level of white hacks.” Jean Toomer’s work will not soon be forgotten and Booker T. Washington’s “Up From Slavery” is no ordinary biography. Jessie Fauset and Eric Walrond deserve notice. Finally, we have H. O. Tanner.\nOn the whole then, despite a stimulating critic’s opinion, we Negroes are quite well satisfied with our Renaissance.

But we would like to point out to those writers who are easily and hastily criticizing this decision and the Firestone concession that a more sympathetic attitude toward Liberia and her problems would better accord with the facts.\nOf the great good will back of Christian missions and the spirit of sacrifice no one doubts. Education and sanitation in Africa and Asia owe a great debt to them. On the other hand they have much evil to answer for: they have helped introduce imperial aggression and harmful trade and they have interfered again and again with blundering ignorance into the delicate internal affairs of nations and peoples they did not understand. When a great rich foreign church establishes in a small poor African land a missionary church and school it can easily come to assume toward the little country an attitude of mastery and dictation which is annoying and dangerous. The American Church in Turkey and the English Church in China are grave political problems in those countries and if Liberia believes that foreign missions are endangering her stability and advance, then instead of swearing at her and calling her names it would be wiser and more Christian to sit in conference with the Liberians and find out how Christianity could help and not hinder that struggling land.\nAgain there is no warrant for the assumption that the new rubber industry in Liberia is bound to spell disaster. Liberia had to have modern industry. Without it the maintenance of her independence in the face of the Modern World was impossible. Her struggle with England, France and Germany was a struggle for adequate capital to support indigenous industries. In that struggle she was cheated of invaluable territory and saddled with unjust debt, but she emerged still independent. Liberia’s financial arrangements with Firestone are as equitable as any country could obtain and far better than anything ever offered Liberia before by any other country. The land is leased and not sold; the power of the government is fully recognized; the necessary loan for harbor facilities and other developments was secured in the open market and not from the Firestone Company; and disputes are to be settled not by the United States but by the League of Nations.\nCertain it is that a great overshadowing corporation like this in a small country is going to wield extraordinary power; as great as that of the railroads and steel and oil interests in the United States. Liberia faces the same difficulty of controlling organized wealth as other modern lands with the disadvantage of being a “colored” country but with the advantage of having two or three million colored voters in the United States who can, if they have sense enough, curb the Firestone power in case it becomes over-aggressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHelping Africa (1924)\nSteal (1920)\nThe Church (1916)\nDarrow (1928)\nFrom a Traveller (1932)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Liberia.” The Crisis 34\n(1): 34. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/34/01/liberia.html."

He sang old eighteenth century songs; he sang Negro melodies; he sang the dream from Manon “as no living singer sings.” Think what it means to every black child in the world to have this black man singing. Let us crowd to hear his every performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPromoting Race Prejudice (1917)\nLight (1912)\nOur Book Shelf (1925)\nNegro Writers (1920)\nThe Newer South (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Hayes.” The Crisis 33 (3):\n129. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/33/03/hayes.html."

First, the system of mandates by which fifteen millions of people occupying an area as large as Europe have been placed under the rule of certain European nations. The Mandates Commission, however, has been repeatedly denied permission to find out at first hand just what the mandatory powers are doing in these territories. This is unfortunate and sometime such power must be granted. Secondly, a new Anti-Slavery treaty has been signed by twenty-three nations. The only suspicious thing about this is that apparently it has been aimed at the household service of Abyssinia instead of considering the shameless exploitation of labor in English, French and Belgian Africa. The third step is that of the International Labor Organization which proposes for the next two or three years to frame with the help of experts an international treaty covering conditions for the future employment of colored laborers. Here again the misfortune is that apparently few representatives of the colored laborers have been called in council while white capital is there in force. Some time the Negro people of the Americas will realize that they ought to have permanent representation at Geneva.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe League of Nations (1919)\nResolutions of the Washington Conference (1917)\nHelping Africa (1924)\nThe Firing Line (1925)\nHayti (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “League of Nations.”\nThe Crisis 33 (3): 130–31. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/33/03/league_of_nations.html."

    "text": "There is no question but that a government can carry on business. Every government does. Whether governmental industry compares in efficiency with private industry depends entirely upon what we call efficiency. And here it is and not elsewhere that the Russian experiment is astonishing and new and of fateful importance to the future civilization. What we call efficiency in America is judged primarily by the resultant profit to the rich and only secondarily by the results to the workers. The face of industrial Europe and America is set toward private wealth; that is, toward the people who have large incomes. We recognize the economic value of small incomes mainly as a means of profit for great incomes. Russia seeks another psychology. Russia is trying to make the workingman the main object of industry. His well-being and his income are deliberately set as the chief ends of organized industry directed by the state.\nOne can stand on the streets of Moscow or Kiev and see clearly that Russia has struck at the citadels of the power that rules modern countries. Not manhood suffrage, woman’s suffrage, state regulation of industry, social reform nor religious and moral teaching in any modern country have shorn organized wealth of its power as the Bolshevik Revolution has done in Russia. Is it possible to conduct a great modern government without the autocratic leadership of the rich? The answer is: this is exactly what Russia is doing today. But can she continue to do this? This is not a question of ethics or economics; it is a question of psychology. Can Russia continue to think of the State in terms of the worker? This can happen only if the Russian people believe and idealize the workingman as the chief citizen. In America we do not. The ideal of every American is the millionaire—or at least the man of “indepentent” income. We regard the laborers as the unfortunate part of the community and even liberal thought is directed toward “emancipating” the workingman by relieving him in part if not entirely of the necessity of work. Russia, on the contrary, is seeking to make a nation believe that work and work that is hard and in some respects disagreeable and work which is to a large extent physical is a necessity of human life at present and likely to be in any conceivable future world; that the people who do this work are the ones who should determine how the national income from their combined efforts should be distributed; in fine, that the Workingman is the State; that he makes civilization possible and should determine what civilization is to be.\nFor this purpose he must be a workingman of skill and intelligence and to this combined end Russian education is being organized. This is what the Russian Dictatorship of the Proletariat means. This dictatorship does not stop there. As the workingman is today neither skilled nor intelligent to any such extent as his responsibilities demand, there is within his ranks the Communist party, directing the proletariat toward their future dictatorship. This is nothing new. In this government “of the people” we have elaborate and many-sided arrangements for ruling the rulers. The test is, are we and Russia really preparing future rulers? In so far as I could see, in shop and school, in the press and on the radio, in books and lectures, in trades unions and National Congresses, Russia is. We are not.\nVisioning now a real Dictatorship of the Proletariat, two questions follow. Is it possible today for a great nation to achieve such a workers’ psychology? And secondly, if it does achieve it what will be its effect upon the world? The achievement of such a psychology depends partly upon Russia and partly upon Western Europe and the United States. In Russia one feels today, even on a casual visit, the beginning of a workingman’s psychology. Workers are the people that fill the streets and live in the best houses, even though these houses are dilapidated; workers crowd (literally crowd) the museums and theaters, hold the high offices, do the public talking, travel in the trains.\nNowhere in modern lands can one see less of the spender and the consumer, the rich owners and buyers of luxuries, the institutions which cater to the idle rich. One sees in Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev neither first-class hotels, nor luxurious restaurants, nor private motor cars, nor silk stockings, nor prostitutes. All these insignia of the great modern city are lacking. On the other hand, the traveler misses the courtesy and savoir faire which one meets in the hotel corridors of London and Paris; one misses the smart shops and well-groomed men and women who are so plentiful in Constantinople and Berlin. Does this mean that Russia has “put over” her new psychology? Not by any means. She is trying and trying hard, but there are plenty of people in Russia who still hate and despise the workingman’s blouses and the peasant’s straw shoes; and plenty of workers who regret the passing of the free-handed Russian nobility; who miss the splendid pageantry of the Czars and who cling doggedly to religious dogma and superstition. There must be in Russia dishonest officials and inefficient statesmen. But here Russia has no monopoly. There are those in Russia and out who say that the present effort cannot succeed for exactly the same reasons that men said the Bourgeoisie could never rule France.\nBut it is the organized capital of America, England, France and Germany which is chiefly instrumental in preventing the realization of the Russian workingman’s psychology. It has used every modern weapon to crush Russia. It sent against Russia every scoundrel who could lead a mob and gave him money, guns and ammunition; and when Russia nearly committed suicide in crushing this civil war, modern industry began the industrial boycott, the refusal of capital and credit which is being carried on today just as far as international jealousy and greed will allow. And can we wonder? If modern capital is owned by the rich and handled for their power and benefit, can the rich be expected to hand it over to their avowed and actual enemies? On the contrary, if modern industry is really for the benefit of the people and if there is an effort to make the people the chief beneficiaries of industry, why is it that this same people is powerless today to help this experiment or at least to give it a clear way? On the other hand, so long as the most powerful nations in the world are determined that Russia must fail, there can be but a minimum of free discussion and democratic difference of opinion in Russia.\nThere is world struggle then in and about Russia; but it is not simply an ethical problem as to whether or not the Russian Revolution was morally right; that is a question which only history will settle. It is not simply the economic question as to whether or not Russia can conduct industry on a national scale. She is doing it today and in so doing she differs only in quantity, not in quality from every other modern country. It is not a question merely of “dictatorship.” We are all subject to this form of government. The real Russian question is: Can you make the worker and not the millionaire the center of modern power and culture? If you can, the Russian Revolution will sweep the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro and Communism (1931)\nTen Years (1927)\nEducation (1911)\nOur Economic Future (1928)\nThe Spread of Socialism (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1927. “Judging Russia.” The Crisis\n33 (4): 189–90. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/33/04/judging_russia.html."

    "text": "It was a brilliant idea when the Walker Manufacturing Company conceived the free trip around the world method of advertising. They have sent now for the third year groups of from four to six popular persons traveling over Europe and Asia and in so doing they have impressed upon certain of our leading citizens the fact that problems of race and color are problems of the world and not simply of the United States.\nIt has been for the purpose of realizing and teaching this fact that I have visited the old world eight times. First, in my young manhood to Germany on a fellowship. Second, to the Paris Exposition at my own expense. Third, to England and Scotland through the gift of an English friend. Fourth, to the Races Congress at the expense of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and John E. Millholland. Fifth and sixth, to the First and Second Pan-African Congresses at the expense of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Seventh, to the Third. Pan-African Congress at the expense of the Circle for Negro War Relief, then a committee of the N.A.C.W.\nMy recent trip I had planned for revisiting Germany and I had hoped to pay for it by certain lectures in Switzerland and Germany and by magazine articles in the United States. Just before I started an American citizen of Russian descent offered to pay the expense if I would go to Russia. I replied:\n\nI am not at all satisfied with the knowledge that I have of the Russian revolution. I should like to learn, if possible, at first hand just what has taken place in Russia and just what the development is at present. I do not know that I could learn anything that would be of advantage to the colored people of the United States, but if there is anything to learn I am eager to learn it. On the other hand, in undertaking this or any other trip I should not want to obligate myself to come to any particular conclusions or to follow any line of action or to see the facts with any other eyes except my own.\n\nMy friend accepted these conditions and I went to Russia.\n THE JOURNEY OF DR. Du Bois TO RUSSIA2. Franfort-on-Main, 3. Berlin, 4. Leningrad, 5. Moscow, 6. Nijni Novgorad, 7. Kiev, 8. Odessa, 9. Constantinople, 10. Skutari, 11. Athens, 12. Naples, 13. Gibraltar.\n\nMy Recent Journey\n\nI went to Antwerp to see Rubens. Then I ascended the Rhine looking at the great vaulted cathedral at Cologne, at the Lorelei, at the Rheinfels, glancing at the old street of the Jews in Frankfort. I went up into the Thuringian forest where I first learned to know the old world and its culture, a quarter century ago. Then I saw Berlin, that giant city which has become since the day I knew it one of the few centers of the world. Taking a little boat at Stettin I sailed three days through the Baltic and the Gulf of Finland until I came to the city that was once St. Petersburg and to the street which was once the Nevski Prospeckt. I saw the dark red mass of the Winter Palace and went out to the gorgeous park that was once the Czar’s village, (Tsarskoe-Selo) and is now called by the Bolsheviks—the Children’s village,—happy word! Staying here but a few days I went on to Moscow where I lived a month. My home was in Revolution Square where I could look upon the walls of the Kremlin. A few steps brought me to Red Square and the Mausoleum of Lenin. I wandered into all the nooks and crannies of the city unattended. Not being an official visitor, I met few officials and did not join the excursions arranged for foreigners.\nBut after all, Moscow is bureaucracy. Real Russia lies outside. I had always wanted to see Nijni Novgorod, far out on the Volga. I wanted to see the Ukraine. Then at Kiev, I started to return through Poland and Berlin, but scanning my geography I figured out a bit of almost impossible romance at no greater cost, and said to myself, “Why not return by the Black Sea and Constantinople and Greece, Naples and Gibralter?” I hesitated. It seemed almost fantastic and yet at last I ventured. I did it.\nBut always the center of all this was Russia, and of Russia I have much to tell in days to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRaces (1911)\nY.M.C.A (1914)\nThe Present (1917)\nWorld War and the Color Line (1914)\nA Winter Pilgrimage (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “Travel.” The Crisis 33 (2):\n63–65. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/33/02/travel.html."

Yonder the sun pours into my window over the domes and eagles and pointed towers of the Kremlin. Here is the old Chinese wall of the inner city; there is the gilded glory of the Cathedral of Christ, the Savior. Thro’ yonder gate on the vast Red Square, Lenin sleeps his last sleep, with long lines of people peering each day into his dead and speaking face. Around me roars a city of two millions—Holy Moscow.\nI have been in Russia something less than two months. I did not see the Russia of war and blood and rapine. I know nothing of political prisoners, secret police and underground propaganda. My knowledge of the Russian language is sketchy and of this vast land, the largest single country on earth, I have traveled over only a small, a very small part.\nBut I have had certain advantages; I have seen something of Russia. I have traveled over two thousand miles and visited four of its largest cities, many of its towns, the Neva, Dneiper, Moscow and Volga of its rivers, and stretches of land and village. I have looked into the faces of its races—Jews, Tartars, Gypsies, Caucasians, Armenians and Chinese. To help my lack of language I have had personal friends, whom I knew before I came to Russia, as interpreters. They were born in Russia and speak English, French and German. This, with my English, German and French, has helped the language difficulty, but did not, of course, solve it.\nI have not done my sight seeing and investigation in gangs and crowds nor according to the program of the official Foreign Bureau; but have in nearly all cases gone alone with one Russian speaking friend. In this way I have seen schools, universities, factories, stores, printing establishments, government offices, palaces, museums, summer colonies of children, libraries, churches, monasteries, boyar houses, theatres, moving-picture houses, day nurseries and co-operatives. I have seen some celebrations—self-governing children in a school house of an evening and 200,000 children and youths marching on Youth Day. I have talked with peasants and laborers, Commissars of the Republic, teachers and children.\nAlone and unaccompanied I have walked the miles of streets in Leningrad, Moskow, Nijni Novgorod and Kiev at morning, noon and night; I have trafficked on the curb and in the stores; I have watched crowds and audiences and groups. I have gathered some documents and figures, plied officials and teachers with questions and sat still and gazed at this Russia, that the spirit of its life and people might enter my veins.\nI stand in astonishment and wonder at the revelation of Russia that has come to me. I may be partially deceived and half-informed.

    "text": "Fifty years ago, on the first day of January, 1863, the American people, by the hand of Abraham Lincoln, took the first formal and legal step to remove the unsightly shackles of slavery from the footstool of American liberty. They did not do this deed deliberately and with lofty purpose, but being forced into a war for the integrity of the Union, they found themselves compelled in self-defense to destroy the power of the South by depriving the South of slave labor and drafting slaves into Northern armies.\nOnce having realized that Liberty and Slavery were incompatible, the nation yielded, for a moment, leadership to its highest ideals: it gave black men not simply physical freedom, but it attempted to give them political freedom and economic freedom and social freedom. It knew then, as it knows now, that no people can be free unless they have the right to vote, the right to land and capital and the right to choose their friends. To call a man free who has not these rights is to mock him and bewilder him and debase him. This the nation knew, and for a time it tried to be true to its nobler self. But social reform costs money and time, and if it seeks to right in one generation three centuries of unspeakable oppression it faces a task of awful proportions. Facing this task and finding it hard, the nation faltered, quibbled and finally is trying an actual volte-face. It has allowed the right to vote to be taken from one and a half out of two million black voters. It has allowed growing land monopoly and a labor legislation that means peonage, child labor and the defilement of women. And above all it has insisted on such barriers to decent human intercourse and understanding between the races that to-day few white men dare call a Negro friend.\nThe result of this silly and suicidal policy has been crime, lynching, mob law, poverty, disease and social unrest. But in spite of this the Negro has refused to believe that the present hesitation and hypocrisy of America is final. Buoyed then by an unfaltering faith, he accumulates property, educates his children, and even enters the world of literature and art. Indeed, so firm has been his faith that large numbers of Negroes have even assented to waive all discussion of their rights, consent to present disfranchisement and do just as far as possible exactly what America wants them to do. But even here let there be no mistake; with Negro agitators and Negro submissionists there is the one goal: eventual full American citizenship with all rights and opportunities of citizens. Remove this hope and you weld ten million men into one unwavering mass who will speak with one voice.\nYet, after fifty years of attempted liberty, the reactionary South and the acquiescent North come forward with this program:\n\nThe absolute disfranchisement of all citizens of Negro descent forever.\nThe curtailment and regulation of property rights by segregation.\nStrictly limited education of Negro children as servants and laborers.\nThe absolute subjection of Negro women by prohibition of legal marriage between races.\nThe eventual driving of the Negro out of the land by disease, starvation of mob violence.\n\nEvery single item in this program has powerful and active support in the halls of legislatures, in the courts of justice, in the editorial rooms of periodicals, and in the councils of Southern secret societies.\nThere are many organizations working against this program, but in most cases the opposition is not vigorous and direct, but apologetic and explanatory, and based on temporary philanthropic relief, rather than eternal justice. We have friends of the Negro who oppose disfranchisement by a program of partial and temporary and indefinite disfranchisement; who tell the Negro to buy property and ignore ghetto legislation; who believe in caste education and hotly accuse others who do not of being ashamed of work; who would preserve one foolish white woman if it costs the degradation of ten innocent colored girls, and who would greet the death of every black man in the world with a sigh of infinite relief.\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People almost alone stands for a frank, open, front, forward attack on the reactionary Southern program. It demands a nation-wide fight for human rights, regardless of race and color; it calls for real democracy, social and economic justice, and a respect for women which is not confined to women of one privileged class.\nIn this fight we want your help? We need it desperately. The nation needs it. How in Heaven’s name shall Liberty and Justice survive in this land if we do not oppose this program of slavery and injustice? Abraham Lincoln began the emancipation of the Negro-American. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People proposes to complete it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLoyalty (1917)\nCivil Rights (1913)\nAn Open Letter (1915)\nBlaine of Maine (1932)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “Emancipation.” The Crisis 5\n(3): 128–29. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/05/03/emancipation.html."

    "text": "A good friend sends us this word: &gt; As an optimist of The Crisis persuasion, I find myself more or less frequently engaged in arguments on the eternal race question. Here is an argument I am often called upon to meet: “Jim Crow” laws make us save money; discrimination makes us appreciate and patronize our own; segregation gives our business men a chance; separate schools give our girls and boys something to work for. Possibly there are many doubtful minds who would be benefited by a word from you on this subject through the columns of The Crisis.\nThere is no doubt that colored people travel less than they otherwise would, on account of ” Jim Crow” cars, and thus have this money to spend otherwise.\nThere is no doubt that thousands of Negro business enterprises have been built up on account of discrimination against colored folks in drug stores, grocery stores, insurance societies and daily papers. In a sense The Crisis is capitalized race prejudice.\nThere is not the slightest doubt but that separate school systems, by giving colored children their own teachers and a sense of racial pride, are enabled to keep more colored children in school and take them through longer courses than outworn handwork or decadent trades mixed systems. The 100,000 Negroes of Baltimore have 600 pupils in the separate high school; New York, with a larger colored population, has less than 200 in its mixed high schools.\nTherefore discrimination is a veiled blessing? It is not, save in a few exceptional cases.\nTake the “Jim Crow” car; is the money saved or merely diverted? Is it diverted to better things than travel or to worse? A s a matter of fact separate cars and parks and public insult have driven Negro amusements indoors, and the result is tuberculosis and pneumonia; they have deprived colored people of the civilization of public contact, and that is an almost irreparable loss.\nTake our business enterprises; they are creditable and promising, but they are compelled to set a lower standard of efficiency than that recognized in the white business world. Our business men must grope in the dark after methods; our buyers do not know how to buy and our clerks do not know how to sell; our banks do not know how to invest, and our insurance societies, with few exceptions, do not know what modern insurance means.\nWe all know this, but whom do we blame? We blame ourselves. We carp and sneer and criticise among ourselves at “colored” enterprises and declare that we can always tell a “colored” store or a “colored” paper by its very appearance. This is not fair. It is cruel and senseless injustice. Negro enterprises conform to a lower standard not because they want to, but because they must. Color prejudice prevents us from training our children and our men to the same standards as those set for the sur­ rounding white world. The colored boy can learn servility, but he is not allowed to learn business methods; colored men learn how to sweep the floor of a bank, but cannot learn the A B C of modern investments; the colored industrial school does not teach modern machine methods, but old and outworn handwork or decadent trades and medieval conditions.\nThe result is that our business men are not the travelers of a broad and beaten path, but wanderers in a wilderness. Considering their opportunity, their fifty banks and tens of thousands of business enterprises and hundreds of thousands of dollars in industrial insurance are little short of marvelous. But to call the cruel discrimination that has misdirected effort, discouraged ability, murdered men and sent women to graves of sorrow—to call this an advantage is to misuse language. The open door of opportunity to colored persons, regard­ less of the accident of color, would have given us to-day $10 of invested capital where we have $1; and ten business men trained to the high and exact standard of modern efficiency where now we have one grim and battered survivor clinging to the ragged edge. Thank God for the dollar and the survivor, but do not thank Him for the discrimination. Thank the devil for that. We black people to­ day are succeeding not because of dis­ crimination, but in spite of it. Without it we would succeed better and faster, and they that deny this are either fools or hypocrites.\nThe same thing is evident in education. Separate school systems give us more pupils but poorer schools. The 200 black high-school pupils in New York have the best high-school equipment in the land—beautiful buildings, costly laboratories, scores of the best teachers, books and materials, everything that money and efficiency can furnish; the Baltimore high school has to struggle in a building about half large enough for its work, with too few teachers and those at low salaries, and with a jealous public that grudges every cent the school has and wants to turn the whole machine into a factory for making servants for smart Baltimore. All honor to their teachers for the splendid work they do in spite of discrimination, but do not credit dis­crimination with the triumph; credit Mason Hawkins.\nTurn to our newspapers. They are a sad lot, we grant you. But whose is the fault? How can they get trained men for their work? How can they get capital for their enterprise? How can they maintain for themselves and their readers a standard even as high as their white contemporaries, not to say higher? Their workers are shut out from the staffs of white magazines and news­ papers; their readers are deprived of the education of social contact and their very writers are, through no fault of their own, illiterate. There lies on our desk this pitiful letter:\n\nDear Editor of The Crisis New York\nIt would confure a great favor upon me if the nessacery arrangment can be secured that i may constribet to your magazine Some of my origanal MS.S. and Poem, as i have joust Begain to Rite Short M.S.S i awaiteing you Reply Your truly.\n\nShall we laugh at this or weep? Who knows what this man might have done or said if the State of Florida had let him learn to read and write? Shall we thank the God of Discrimination for planting literature in such soil or shall we hate it with perfect hatred?\nNo. Race discrimination is evil. It forces those discriminated against to a lower standard and then judges them by a higher. It demands that we do more with less opportunity than others do. It denies to present workers the accumu­lated experience of the past and compels them at fearful cost to make again the mistakes of the past. Out of this cruel grilling may and do come strong char­acters, but out of it also come- the criminal and the stunted, the bitter and the insane. One is just as much the fruit of the tree as the other. If in any place and time race hatred is so un­ reasoning and bitter that separate schools, cars and churches are inevita­ble, we must accept it, make the best of it and turn even its disadvantages to our advantage. But we must never for­ get that none of its possible advantages can offset its miserable evils, or replace the opportunity, the broad education, the free competition and the generous emul­ation of free men in a free world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe “Jim Crow” Argument (1913)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nA Statement (1919)\nJim Crow (1919)\nThe Fruit of the Tree (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “Blessed Discrimination.”\nThe Crisis 5 (4): 184–86. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/05/04/blesseddiscrimination.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "SIR:\nYour inauguration to the Presidency of the United States is to the colored people, to the white South and to the nation a momentous occasion. For the first time since the emancipation of slaves the government of this nation—the Presidency, the Senate, the House of Representatives and, practically, the Supreme Court—passes on the 4th of March into the hands of the party which a half century ago fought desperately to keep black men as real estate in the eyes of the law.\nYour elevation to the chief magistracy of the nation at this time shows not simply a splendid national faith in the perpetuity of free government in this land, but even more, a personal faith in you.\nWe black men by our votes helped to put you in your high position. It is true that in your overwhelming triumph at the polls you might have succeeded without our aid, but the fact remains that our votes helped elect you this time, and that the time may easily come in the near future when without our 500,000 ballots neither you nor your party can control the government.\nTrue as this is, we would not be misunderstood. We do not ask or expect special consideration or treatment in return for our franchises. We did not vote for you and your party because you represented our best judgment. It was not because we loved Democrats more, but Republicans less and Roosevelt least, that led to our action.\nCalmly reviewing our action we are glad of it. It was a step toward political independence, and it was helping to put into power a man who has to-day the power to become the greatest benefactor of his country since Abraham Lincoln.\nWe say this to you, sir, advisedly. We believe that the Negro problem is in many respects the greatest problem facing the nation, and we believe that you have the opportunity of beginning a just and righteous solution of this burning human wrong. This opportunity is yours because, while a Southerner in birth and tradition, you have escaped the provincial training of the South and you have not had burned into your soul desperate hatred and despising of your darker fellow men.\nYou start then where no Northerner could start, and perhaps your only real handicap is peculiar lack of personal acquaintance with individual black men, a lack which is the pitiable cause of much social misery and hurt. A president of Harvard or Columbia would have known a few black men as men. It is sad that this privilege is denied a president of Princeton, sad for him and for his students.\nBut waiving this, you face no insoluble problem. The only time when the Negro problem is insoluble is when men insist on settling it wrong by asking absolutely contradictory things. You cannot make 10,000,000 people at one and the same time servile and dignified, docile and self-reliant, servants and independent leaders, segregated and yet part of the industrial organism, disfranchised and citizens of a democracy, ignorant and intelligent. This is impossible and the impossibility is not factitious; it is in the very nature of things.\nOn the other hand, a determination on the part of intelligent and decent Americans to see that no man is denied a reasonable chance for life, liberty and happiness simply because of the color of his skin is a simple, sane and practical solution of the race problem in this land. The education of colored children, the opening of the gates of industrial opportunity to colored workers, absolute equality of all citizens before the law, the civil rights of all decently behaving citizens in places of public accommodation and entertainment, absolute impartiality in the granting of the right of suffrage—these things are the bedrock of a just solution of the rights of man in the American Republic.\nNor does this solution of color, race and class discrimination abate one jot or tittle the just fight of humanity against crime, ignorance, inefficiency and the right to choose one’s own wife and dinner companions.\nAgainst this plain straight truth the forces of hell in this country are fighting a terrific and momentarily successful battle. You may not realize this, Mr. Wilson. To the quiet walls of Princeton where no Negro student is admitted the noise of the fight and the reek of its blood may have penetrated but vaguely and dimly.\nBut the fight is on, and you, sir, are this month stepping into its arena. Its virulence will doubtless surprise you and it may scare you as it scared one William Howard Taft. But we trust not; we think not.\nFirst you will be urged to surrender your conscience and intelligence in these matters to the keeping of your Southern friends. They “know the Negro,” as they will continually tell you. And this is true. They do know “the Negro,” but the question for you to settle is whether or not the Negro whom they know is the real Negro or the Negro of their vivid imaginations and violent prejudices.\nWhatever Negro it is that your Southern friends know, it is your duty to know the real Negro and know him personally. This will be no easy task. The embattled Bourbons, from the distinguished Blease to the gifted Hoke Smith, will evince grim determination to keep you from contact with any colored person. It will take more than general goodwill on your part to foil the wide conspiracy to make Negroes known to their fellow Americans not as flesh and blood but as beasts of fiction.\nYou must remember that the ability, sincerity and worth of one-tenth of the population of your country will be absolutely veiled from you unless you make effort to lift the veil. When you make that effort, then more trouble will follow. If you tell your Southern friends that you have discovered that the internal revenue of New York is well collected and administered, they are going to regard you in pained surprise. Can a Negro administer! they will exclaim, ignoring the fact that he does.\nBut it is not the offices at your disposal, President Woodrow Wilson, that is the burden of our great cry to you. We want to be treated as men. We want to vote. We want our children educated. We want lynching stopped. We want no longer to be herded as cattle on street cars and railroads. We want the right to earn a living, to own our own property and to spend our income unhindered and unaccused. Your power is limited? We know that, but the power of the American people is unlimited. To-day you embody that power, you typify its ideals. In the name then of that common country for which your fathers and ours have bled and toiled, be not untrue, President Wilson, to the highest ideals of American Democracy.\nRespectfully yours,\n\nThe Crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Election (1912)\nPresidential Candidates (1916)\nThe South in the Saddle (1914)\nEducation (1913)\nThe President (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “An Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson.”\nThe Crisis 5 (5): 236–37. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/05/05/open_letter.html."

    "text": "It is a source of deep gratification to The Crisisthat William H. Taft and Theodore Roosevelt have been defeated in their candidacy for the presidency of this nation. Mr. Taft, refusing to follow the footsteps of the brave Abolitionist, his father, allowed the enemies of the Negro race in the South practically to dictate his policy toward black men. Theodore Roosevelt not only made and gloried in the wretched judicial lynching at Brownsville, but gave Negro disfranchisement its greatest encouragement by disfranchising 1,000,000 colored voters in the councils of his new party of social progress.\nWe are gratified in New York State at the victory of Sulzer over Straus; the former has been a consistent sympathizer with black folk, and the latter, on at least two critical occasions, has failed them.\nWe are gratified that at least 100,000 black votes went to swell the 6,000,000 that called Woodrow Wilson to the presidency. We do not as Negroes conceal or attempt to conceal the risk involved in this action. We have helped call to power not simply a scholar and a gentleman, but with him and in his closest counsels all the Negro-hating, disfranchising and lynching South. With Woodrow Wilson there triumphs, too. Hoke Smith, Cole Blease, Jim Vardanian and Jeff Davis, and other enemies of democracy and decency. We know that such men, being considered in this land the “social equals”of gentlemen and ladies, can come into close and continual contact with the new President, while colored men will meet him with the utmost difficulty.\nWhy then did we vote for Mr. Wilson? Because, first, we faced desperate alternatives, and because, secondly, Mr. Wilson’s personality gives us hope that reactionary Southern sentiment will not control him. How long shall a man submit to insult and injury from alleged friends without protest, even if the protest involves the encouragement of erstwhile enemies? Moreover, can Mr. Wilson be fairly considered an enemy? Deliberately, and over his own signature, he has expressed:\n\nHis “earnest wash to see justice done them [the colored people] in every matter; and not mere grudging justice, but justice executed with liberality and cordial good feeling.”\nTheir right “to be encouraged in every possible and proper way.”\n“I want to assure them that should I become President of the United States they may count upon me for absolute fair dealing, for everything by which I could assist in advancing the interests of their race in the United States.”\n\nIn such a statement from an honorable and sincere man there remains but one source of apprehension: How far are the colored people going to be allowed a chance to convince Mr. Wilson of injustice; how far may they indicate lines of encouragement, and how far will they be permitted to judge and speak as to their own interests?\nIn other words, it is quite possible that Mr. Wilson, surrounded by counselors who hate us, may never realize what we suffer, how we are discouraged, and the hindrances to our advance. It will take, on Mr. Wilson’s part, more than good will—it will demand active determination to know and receive the truth, to get at the sources of Negro public opinion and sympathize with wrongs that only Negroes know, if he fulfils his own promises and the hopes of millions of men.\nAs to whether, beyond Mr. Wilson’s personal efforts, the Democratic party is prepared to become a real party of the people, and advance toward those great ideals of social democracy which every true patriot desires, is a question. Certainly its first step will be to discard the Southern oligarchy and combine the liberal and progressive policies of North and South, white and black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMr. Taft (1911)\nThe Election (1910)\nAn Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson (1913)\nMr. Roosevelt (1912)\nThe Presidential Campaign (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “The Election.” The Crisis 5\n(2): 75--76. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/05/02/the_election.html."

    "text": "The people of America, and especially the people of the Southern States, have felt so keen an appreciation of the qualities of motherhood in the Negro that they have proposed erecting a statue in the National Capital to the black mammy. The black nurse of slavery days may receive the tribute of enduring bronze from the master class.\nBut this appreciation of the black mammy is always of the foster mammy, not of the mother in her home, attending to her own babies. And as the colored mother has retreated to her own home, the master class has cried out against her. “She is thriftless and stupid,” the white mother says, “when she refuses to nurse my baby and stays with her own. She is bringing her daughter up beyond her station when she trains her to be a teacher instead of sending her into my home to act as nursemaid to my little boy and girl. I will never enter her street, heaven forbid. A colored street is taboo, and she no longer deserves my approval when she refuses to leave her home and enter mine.”\nLet us hope that the black mammy, for whom so many sentimental tears have been shed, has disappeared from American life. She existed under a false social system that deprived her of husband and child. Thomas Nelson Page, after—with wet eyelids—recounting the virtues of his mammy, declares petulantly that she did not care for her own children. Doubtless this was true. How could it have been otherwise? But just so far as it was true it was a perversion of motherhood.\nLet the present-day mammies suckle their own children. Let them walk in the sunshine with their own toddling boys and girls and put their own sleepy little brothers and sisters to bed. As their girls grow to womanhood, let them see to it that, if possible, they do not enter domestic service in those homes where they are unprotected, and where their womanhood is not treated with respect. In the midst of immense difficulties, surrounded by caste, and hemmed in by restricted economic opportunity, let the colored mother of to-day build her own statue, and let it be the four walls of her own unsullied home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe True Brownies (1919)\nLight (1912)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nEducation (1911)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “The Black Mother.”\nThe Crisis 5 (2): 78. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/05/02/black_mother.html."

    "text": "It is natural that there should be many misapprehensions concerning the origin of The Crisis as well as its object. Every man with a cause longs to voice his belief. Most men, however, like the editor of this magazine, are held back by a very genuine doubt as to whether the public will recognize any worth in the proposed message. They know—or they think they know—that when the message is voiced, and the world realizes its full import, it will welcome and help actively in its spread.\nThe problem is then how to begin, how first to spread the message. Capital must be had for the launching of such an enterprise, but how may one raise it and whence? It seemed to the editor of The Crisis in earlier years that the benevolent rich might be approached with such a proposition. He forgot that the benevolent are besieged with schemes of all sorts and have little time or ability to judge a matter the justification of which lies in the far future. They are used to helping the thing that has already proven its worth.\nA second method would be to furnish the necessary capital oneself and thus bridge the starving period. Now the capital that an American colored man, working at “colored” wages, can afford to put into a periodical of purpose is small. The Crisis is a small magazine run on extremely economical lines with a small—much too small—working force; but The Crisis costs over $1,000 a month to publish and distribute. Persons proposing to start small magazines should remember this. Yet an earnest agent who is about to buy twenty-five copies a month writes us: “I will handle your magazine if you will promise to enlarge it soon!”\nThe push of the unspoken thought that demands utterance is strong. So, despite cost and trouble, the editor attempted seven years ago a small magazine-like weekly, published at Memphis, Tenn., and called The Moon. The editor gave all his savings, some twelve hundred little dollars, into the hands of an ambitious young printer, turned the whole business responsibility over to him and furnished his services as editor free. The result was a flash of popularity, a year of unsystematic struggle, and then the clear realization that either the editor must give his whole time and help in the business management or give up. Now as the editor was earning his daily bread as well as capital for The Moon by his work as teacher, giving this up seemed impossible and the Moon set.\nImmediately friends came forward and said: “But we must have such a periodical as you sought to give us. Suppose we help you bear the expense?” The result was a miniature magazine called The Horizon, published for nearly three years in Washington, D.C., by men who themselves paid the deficit out of their shallow pockets.\nHere we faced a new problem. Scarcely 500 copies of the magazine were sold monthly, and, as the young manager flatly put it, it seemed as it “the people don’t want it.”\nThe problem was serious. If it was true that 10,000,000 serfs did not want a single untrammeled champion of their larger rights and ambitions, then the problem of those rights and ambitions was even graver than the editor had dreamed. But the editor doubted. Was it proven that the colored folk did not want such a magazine? Had they been given a fair chance to decide?\nWhile these questions were being pondered the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was formed and the editor was asked to become director of publicity and research.\nArticles in this number show how difficult it is to try to get publicity on the Negro problem in the regular periodical press unless the black man is vilified and traduced. The editor therefore said to his board of directors: “If we are to have publicity, it must be through an organ of our own.” The board hesitated. They knew far better than the editor that magazines cost money, and despite legends to the contrary, they had almost no money. Nevertheless, the necessity of some organ was great, and with many misgivings the board authorized an expenditure of $50 a month for a small monthly.\nThe editor will not soon forget that first number of The Crisis. William English Walling suggested the name; Mary Dunlop Maclean saw to the “makeup;” Robert N. Wood took the printing contract. But it was the editor alone, looking out on the forest of roofs of lower Broadway, who asked and asked again the momentous question: “*Dare I order 500 copies — or 1,000?” And when in a fit of wild adventure he ordered 1,000 copies printed he felt like Wellington before Waterloo. Month before last The Crisis in a fit of parsimony ordered but 20,000 copies printed. The result was that orders for over 1,000 copies could not be filled, so that last month we returned to our regular 22,000 edition. When we tell facts like these, people imagine large capital and dividends in connection with our magazine. Not so. Not a cent of capital has been invested in the magazine, except that the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has furnished the services of the editor free of charge. This means that The Crisis is not quite paying expenses, for it could not to-day, with its present income and expense, afford to pay an editor.\nCan, now, a magazine like The Crisis ever become entirely self-supporting? Many of our friends doubt this. They point to the graveyard of ambitious and worthy ventures—the Colored American and the Voice of the Negro to name the latest—and say the American Negro has not yet reached the place where he appreciates a magazine enough to pay for its support. We doubt this assertion. We actually sell each month over 21,500 magazines. We are sure that if we could get The Crisis to persons who want it we could to-day sell 50,000. The problem of distribution is, however, extremely difficult. We cannot use the ordinary channels of distribution, but must have our own agents, and these agents must be largely missionaries in a crusade, because it hardly pays them to give their time to one magazine.\nWhen once The Crisis can reach a circulation of 50,000 its permanence and independence are assured. Until it can there must always be the element of doubt as to whether such a magazine can command the requisite support. We believe it can. The experience of the first two years is more than encouraging. The Crisis has to-day the largest net circulation of any periodical devoted to the Negro race in America. If the growth in the next two years parallels the past, then one at least of our problems will be solved—the problem of publicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWe Come of Age (1915)\nTruth and Beauty (1922)\nJoin or Die (1914)\nPublicity (1922)\nBooming The Crisis (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1912. “The Second Birthday.”\nThe Crisis 5 (1): 27–28. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/05/01/second_birthday.html."

Railroad, on being detained from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m., by reason of a freight wreck, were ushered into the dining car and given supper without one single word of comment or protest from the whites, who were eating at the same time.\n\nThe editor read this and read it yet again. At first he thought it was a banquet given to black men by white; then he thought it charity to the hungry poor; then—then it dawned on his darkened soul: Two decently dressed, educated colored men had been allowed to pay for their unobtrusive meal in a Pullman dining car “WITHOUT ONE SINGLE WORD OF COMMENT OR PROTEST!” No one had cursed them; none had thrown plates at them; they were not lynched! And in humble ecstasy at being treated for once like ordinary human beings they rushed from the car and sent a letter a thousand miles to say to the world: “My God! Look! See!”\nWhat more eloquent comment could be made on the white South? What more stinging indictment could be voiced? What must be the daily and hourly treatment of black men in Paducah, Ky., to bring this burst of applause at the sheerest and most negative decency?\nYet every black man in America has known that same elation—North and South and West. We have all of us felt the sudden relief—the half-mad delight when contrary to fixed expectation we were treated as men and not dogs; and then, in the next breath, we hated ourselves for elation over that which was but due any human being.\nThis is the real tragedy of the Negro in America: the inner degradation, the hurt hound feeling; the sort of upturning of all values which leads some black men to “rejoice” because “only” sixty-four Negroes were lynched in the year of our Lord 1912.\nConceive, O poet, a ghastlier tragedy than such a state of mind!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Matter of Manners (1920)\nPrecept and Practice (1910)\nBurleson (1913)\nPrejudice (1911)\nA Soldier (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “The Hurt Hound.” The Crisis\n5 (6): 290–91. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/05/06/hurt_hound.html."

The favorite device of the devil, ancient and modern, is to force a human being into a more or less artificial class, accuse the class of unnamed and unnamable sin, and then damn any individual in the alleged class, however innocent he may be.\nThis is the medieval tyranny which the South has revived in “Jim Crow” legislation and which Missouri is striving for. The South fulminates against dirt, crime and bad manners and then herds in the “Jim Crow” car the clean and unclean and the innocent and guilty and the decent and indecent. Separation is impossible in a democracy. It means segregation, subordination and tyranny.\nSocial equality? Of course we want social equality.

What, for instance, could be more gratifying than this?\nIt is a reprimand from the Commander-in-Chief of the army, the President himself, to a colonel who failed to advance a man on account of a prejudice against his race:\n\nThe President directs the Secretary of War to inform Col. Garrard that his attitude in this matter is strongly disapproved as contrary to the ideals and principles of this country.   Such procedure indicates not only prejudice that should not be found in an officer of his position and experience, but amounts to a failure to justly and fairly consider the merits and claims of the applicant as shown by his efficient service and excellent standing in the mental examinations.   Col. Garrard has been admonished to avoid a repetition of the action taken in this case.\n\nAnd read this argument against disfranchisement. Does it not deal clearly and comprehensively with the matter? It is the Saturday Evening Post of Philadelphia which speaks:\n\nFor a hundred years they have been demonstrating that they know how to fight; and the last century of history shows that ability to fight, without some political ability, does a people little good. After each victory they remain, as before, subject to whatever mere luck may bring them of good or bad in a ruler. Excluding a people from politics … because they are politically inexperienced, is of a piece with keeping a child out of the water because he doesn’t know how to swim.\n\nHow, then, has our cause gained two great allies? Is the fold larger by two wandering sheep? Not so, reader. Be not too lifted up. President Taft was dealing with the case of a Jewish soldier and the Saturday Evening Post was speaking of Mexico.\nYou see, our Jewish citizens have votes, and as to Mexico, does not charity begin abroad? Good luck to the Jews—they are our best friends, and we rejoice to see them getting out of the Ghetto the Negro is just getting into. Good luck to our Indian brother in Mexico—may he find friends on every side. But it does seem odd that the rules of justice and logic should never apply in the case of the colored man right here in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nPresidential Candidates (1920)\nA Statement (1919)\nThe Present (1917)\nMr. Roosevelt (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Allies.” The Crisis 2 (3):\n112–13. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/02/03/allies.html."

    "text": "There is in the world no city like London. Nor is its distinction merely a matter of size. To be sure, it is a vast aggregation of men—it gives the visitor a curious sense of endlessness by its very disorganization, by the fact that one can find center after center of busy running life stretching away mile after mile and yet all is London. London has no beauty that will compare it to Paris, no blare and flare like New York.\nYet London has an individuality, a tradition and an importance that make it the capital of the world in a sense, true of no other center since the days of imperial Rome. The individuality is peculiar, subtle, striking—yet difficult to express. One sees a busy mart of endless interests, worldwide ramifications, tremendous power. One sees a tradition, a memory clothed in living flesh and word, and a power which makes this city an expression of the empire on which the sun never sets.\nThis empire is a colored empire. Most of its subjects—a vast majority of its subjects—are colored people. And more and more the streets of London are showing this fact. I seldom step into the streets without meeting a half dozen East Indians, a Chinaman, a Japanese or a Malay, and here and there a Negro. There must be thousands of colored people in the city. They do not, of course, color the world so obviously as in an American city, but one senses continually the darker world.\nNo pageant to-day in London is complete without the colored representatives. In the two great coronation processions it was the black and brown and yellow Indian princes in the brilliant magnificence of their silk and jewels who shared the plaudits of the crowds with the king himself, and the black Prince of Abyssinia rode among the royal guests.\nLondon is polite and considerate to her darker brothers. There is color prejudice and aloofness undoubtedly here, but it does not parade its shame like New York or its barbarity like New Orleans. Hotel, theater and restaurant stand not only open, but studiously attentive and polite. The courtesies of the street and the tram-car are thoughtfully passed, and in the highest social life colored men and women at the last days of festivity sat at the tables of the highest in the land.\nYet London is uneasy. London is sensing the strength and determination in the darker world and is wondering what it all portends in the future. The unrest in India and Egypt causes deep and widespread apprehension in all England, and the situation in South Africa is being narrowly watched.\nWhat more fitting center then than London for the coming together of the first world conference of the races and peoples of the world! They are to meet not as master and slave, missionary and heathen, conqueror and conquered—but as men and equals in the center of the world, and the meeting will be watched with intense interest and remembered for many a long day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMy Mission (1919)\nVisitors (1928)\nThe South (1917)\nThe Crisis (1910)\nTravel (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “London.” The Crisis 2 (4):\n159. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/02/04/london.html."

    "text": "If Americans who have long since said the last word con­cerning the races of men and their proper relations will read the papers laid before the First Universal Races Congress, they will realize that America is fifty years behind the scientific world in its racial philosophy.\nBefore the publication of this epoch-making volume, The Crisis would not dare to express the statements which are contained therein. The leading scientists of the world have come forward in this book and laid down in categorical terms a series of proposi­tions which may be summarized as follows:\n\n\nIt is not legitimate to argue from differences in physical characteristics to differences in mental characteristics, (b) The mental characteristics differentiating a particular people or race are not (1) unchangeable, or (2) modifiable only through long ages of environmental pressure; but (3) marked improvements in mass education, in public sentiment, and in environment generally, may, apart from intermarriage—as the history of many a country proves—materially transform mental characteristics in a generation or two.\n\nThe civilization of a people or race at any particular moment of time offers no index to its innate or inherited capacities. In this respect it is of great importance to recognize that in the light of universal history civilizations are meteoric in nature, bursting out of relative obscurity only to plunge back into it.\n\nOne ought to combat the irreconcilable contention prevalent among the various groups of mankind that their customs, their civilization, and their physique are superior to those of other groups, (b) In explanation of existing differences it would be pertinent to refer to the special needs arising from peculiar geographical and economic conditions and to related divergencies in national history; and, in explanation of the attitude of superiority assumed, it should be shown that intimacy leads to a love of our own customs, and unfamiliarity, among precipitate reasoners, to dislike and contempt for others’ customs.\n\n\nDivergencies in economic, hygienic, moral and educational standards are potent causes in keeping peoples apart who commercially or otherwise come in contact with each other, just as they keep classes apart, (b) These differences, like social differences generally, are in substance almost certainly due to passing social conditions, and not to inborn characteristics; and the aim should therefore be, as in social differences generally, to remove these differences rather than to accentuate them by regarding them as fixed.\n\n\nThe deepest cause of misunderstandings between peoples is perhaps the tacit assumption that the present characteristics of a people are the expression of permanent qualities. (b) If this is so, anthropologists, sociologists and scientific thinkers as a class could powerfully assist the movement for a juster appreciation of peoples by persistently pointing out in their lectures and in their works the fundamental fallacy involved in taking a static instead of a dynamic, a momentary instead of a historic, a fixed instead of a comparative, point of view of peoples; (c) and such dynamic teaching could be conveniently introduced into schools, more especially in the geography and history lessons, also into colleges for the training of teachers, diplomats, Colonial administrators, preachers and missionaries.\n\n\nThe belief in racial or national superiority is largely due, as is suggested above, to unenlightened psychological repulsion and underestimation of the dynamic or environmental factors, (b) Since, therefore, there is no fair proof of some races being substantially superior to others in inborn capacity, our moral standard, or the manner of treating others—seeing how under favorable circumstances one people after another rises to fame, and how members of all human groups pass through universities with equal success—should remain the same whatever people we are dealing with.\n\n\nSo far at least as intellectual and moral aptitudes are concerned, we ought to speak of civilizations where we now speak of races, (b) Indeed, even the physical characteristics, excluding the skin color of a people, are to no small extent the direct result of the physical and social environment under which it is living at any moment, and hence these characteristics differ measurably both in the history and in the different social strata of one and the same people; and (c) these physical characteristics are furthermore too indefinite and elusive to serve as a basis for any rigid classification or division of human groups, more especially as there has been much interbreeding among all peoples and because race characteris­tics are even said to distinguish every country and almost every province.\n\n\nThe most fruitful cause of race crossing is ill-will—as illustrated by war, conquest, slavery, exploitation and persecution—for where there exists mutual respect the differences in differing traditions, etc., make it almost an invariable rule that intermarriage is avoided—as is shown by any two nations friendly to each other; (b) but intermarriage, we find—contrary to popular tenets—improves the vitality and capacity of a people, and cannot, therefore, be objectionable in itself, (c) The chief drawback to intermarriage between peoples is the same as the drawback to intermarriage between different social classes—i.e., the different traditions of the partners in marriage, (d) Those who dread intermarriage should, therefore, reflect both that there is no such thing as purity of race, and that the rate of crossing decreases with the increase of interracial and international amity.\n\n\nEach people might study with advantage the customs and civilizations of other races or peoples, including those it thinks the lowest ones, for the definite purpose of improving its own customs and civilization, since the lowliest civilizations even have much to teach, (b) Dignified and unostentatious conduct and deferential respect for the customs of others, provided these are not morally objectionable to an unprejudiced mind, should be recommended to all who come in passing or permanent contact with members of human groups that are unfamiliar to them.\n\n\nThese are a fair summary of the conclusions of writers who are among the best-known names in modern science. In the next number of The Crisis we shall give some of their views at length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nUnity (1924)\nA Statement (1919)\nRace Pride (1920)\nLies Agreed Upon (1916)\nPan-Africa and New Racial Philosophy (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Races.” The Crisis 2 (4):\n157–58. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/02/04/races.html."

    "text": "Let the eagle scream! Again the burden of upholding the best traditions of Anglo-Saxon civilization has fallen on the sturdy shoulders of the American republic. Once more a howling mob of the best citizens in a foremost State of the Union has vindicated the self-evident superiority of the white race. The case was perfectly clear; it was not that murder had been done, for we Americans are not squeamish at mere murder. Off and on we do more of that kind of thing than most folk. Moreover, there was not much of a murder—only the crazed act of a drunken man quite unpremeditated. The point is he was black.\nBlackness must be punished. Blackness is the crime of crimes, as the opera-bouffe senator-elect from Mississippi has amply proven. Why is it a crime? Because it threatens white supremacy. A black might—why, civilization might be black! It is therefore necessary, as every white scoundrel in the nation knows, to let slip no opportunity of punishing this crime of crimes. Of course, if possible, the pretext should be great and overwhelming—some awful stunning crime made even more horrible by reporters’ imaginations. Failing this, mere murder, arson, barn burning or impudence may do; indeed, must do.\nOnce the pretext given, then let loose the majesty of American culture. It must warm the hearts of every true son of the republic to read how the brawn and sinew of Coatesville rallied to the great and glorious deed. It deserves a poem; think of the hoary farmers, toilworn with the light of a holy purpose in their eyes and pitchforks in their hands. “The churches were nearly deserted,” say the papers. Splendid! Was it not fitting that Coatesville religion should lend its deacons and Sunday-school superintendents to the holy crusade? Did they not choose a noble day? Sunday, the festival of the risen Prince of Peace.\nAh, the splendor of that Sunday night dance. The flames beat and curled against the moonlit sky. The church bells chimed. The scorched and crooked thing, self-wounded and chained to his cot, crawled to the edge of the ash with a stifled groan, but the brave and sturdy farmers pricked him back with the bloody pitchforks until the deed was done.\nLet the eagle scream!\nCivilization is again safe.\n“Oh, say, can you see by the dawn’s early light” that soap box of blackened bones and dust, standing in the dew and sunlight on the King’s highway to the City of Brotherly Love, while, as the press reports, “all day long, not only from Coatesville, but from all Chester County, and even from Philadelphia, people walked and drove out to the scene of the burning. Men and women poked the ashes and a shout of glee would signalize the finding of a blackened tooth or mere portions of unrecognizable bones. By noon the black heap had been leveled and only the scorched ground was left to tell what had happened there.”\nSome foolish people talk of punishing the heroic mob, and the Governor of Pennsylvania seems to be real provoked. We hasten to assure our readers that nothing will be done. There may be a few formal arrests, but the men will be promptly released by the mob sitting as jury—perhaps even as judge.\nAmerica knows her true heroes.\nAgain, let the eagle scream!\nBut let every black American gird up his loins. The great day is coming. We have crawled and pleaded for justice and we have been cheerfully spit upon and murdered and burned. We will not endure it forever. If we are to die, in God’s name let us perish like men and not like bales of hay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCrime (1920)\nThe Old Story (1911)\nMurder (1914)\nCourts and Jails (1932)\nLynching (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Triumph.” The Crisis 2 (5):\n195. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/02/05/triumph.html."

    "text": "The greatest event of the twentieth century so far was the First Universal Races Congress. It was more significant than the Russian-Japanese war, the Hague Conference or the rise of Socialism. It was significant not on account of the size of its meetings, well attended as they were; not on account of the weight of its utterances, weighty as they were; not on account of the publicity it received or the influence it spread.\nThe Universal Races Congress was great because it marked the first time in the history of mankind when a world congress dared openly and explicitly to take its stand on the platform of human equality—the essential divinity of man.\nFor the first time in history the representatives of a majority of all the nations of the earth met on a frankly equal footing to discuss their relations to each other, and the ways and means of breaking down the absurd and deadly differences that make men hate and despise each other simply because they do not look and think and act alike.\nOther world congresses there have been, and they have not dared to attack this problem openly and honestly. The Church has repeatedly dodged and temporized with race prejudice. The State has openly used it for conquest, murder and oppression Great reform movements like the Peace and Labor movement have again and again refused to see in race prejudice their greatest obstacle, their subtlest and deadliest enemy.\nHere at last is a full fair frontal attack on the nastiest modern survival of ancient barbarism. It was a great day for humanity. It was a great day even in the light of the expected criticisms that the Congress accomplished nothing. It accomplished wonders. It met successfully in peace and concord and yet with unusual freedom of speech. It secured the co-operation of many of the leading people of the world and induced them to stand openly on its platform not simply of.\n“Peace,” but of “Good Will Toward Men.” Finally it took steps toward the perfection of a world organization for interracial concord, investigation and co-operation.\nEvery word uttered, every step taken by this Congress is in direct opposition to the dominant philosophy of race hatred, suppression and lynching current in the United States. The sooner sane and honest Americans realize that the present policy of America toward the Negro race is directly contrary to Christian, Mohammedan and Buddhist ethics, and is a disintegrating and degrading force which the best thought and conscience of the world condemns, the sooner will such people join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and fight for true liberty and decency.\nCan anyone doubt the ripeness of the time?

    "text": "Two utterances by Mr. Booker T. Washington this week illustrate the reasons why so many thinking men, black and white, are coming to doubt Mr. Washington’s statesmanship. One statement is in the current Outlook and is to the effect that Mr. John E. Milholland and “certain members of my own race in the North have objected because they said I did not paint conditions in the South black enough. … I have never denied that the Negro in the South frequently meets with wrong and injustice, but he does not starve.” And he quotes facts to show that there is actual starvation in London.\nThis argument reduces itself to several propositions:\n\n\nIt is not well to tell the whole story of wrong and injustice in the South, but rather one should emphasize the better aspects.\n\nStarvation is worse than other kinds of wrong and injustice.\n\nBecause there are persons starving in England, neither England not black men in America ought to harp on America’s injustice.\n\nThe last two propositions are matters of opinion and taste; but the first proposition has been the keynote of Mr. Washington’s propaganda for the last fifteen years. It has, however, been ineffective in practice and logically dangerous. It is ineffective in practice because under its aegis—under the silence, the absence of criticism, the kindly sentiments and widespread complacency, we have seen grow up in the South a caste system which threatens the foundations of democracy, and a lawlessness which threatens all government.\nWe have seen wholesale disfranchisement of colored voters, color caste carried to the point of positive cruelty, the rule of the mob and the lynching of 2,000 men without legal trial, growing discrimination in schools, travel, and public conveniences, and an openly declared determination to stop the development of millions of men at the dead line of color.\nTo offset this Mr. Washington has a right to point to increased accumulation of property among Negroes and increased numbers of intelligent and forceful black folk. But what has been the result of this? It has been an intensified prejudice as shown in the new Ghetto laws, the strikes against black workers, spread of civil discrimination, and the crystallization of the disfranchising sentiment. How any intelligent American can calmly and without hysteria or prejudice look on the development of the Negro problem in the United States in the last ten years and say that race and color prejudice has decreased, South or North, or shows reasonable signs of abating in the near future, passes our comprehension. And yet Mr. Washington is reported to have said at the recent Unitarian dinner that “Prejudice still exists, but it is not so bitter as it was,” and that the South is an example of the overcoming of race prejudice.\nWhy now does Mr. Washington persist in making from time to time statements of this kind? It is, we believe, because of a dangerous logical fallacy into which Mr. Washington and his supporters fall. They assume that the truth—the real facts concerning a social situation at any particular time—is of less importance than the people’s feeling concerning those facts. There could be no more dangerous social pragmatism. Its basic assumption is that the facts are in reality known, while its whole action prevents the facts from being known. It is a self-contradictory and deceptive position and it has historically led to social damnation in thousands of awful cases. Even where its complacent ignorance has accidentally evolved into good, the good came not because of it but in spite of it. Just here it is that Mr. Washington utterly fails in his English comparisons: It is not starvation that civilization need fear, if civilization faces the awful fact and calls it starvation, knows its gaunt and threatening shape and says with Lloyd-George, We will stop it if we shake the economic foundations of the empire. But the starvation which the world and Mr. Washington would do well to fear is that which blinds its eyes to stalking misery in the East End and cries, “Lo! the Power of England!” So, too, in the United States: Awful as race prejudice, lawlessness and ignorance are, we can fight them if we frankly face them and dare name them and tell the truth; but if we continually dodge and cloud the issue, and say the half truth because the whole stings and shames; if we do this, we invite catastrophe. Let us then in all charity but unflinching firmness set our faces against all statesmanship that looks in such directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Statement (1919)\nVital Statistics (1912)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nThe Fruit of the Tree (1913)\nTillman (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Starvation and Prejudice.”\nThe Crisis 2 (2): 62–64. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/02/02/starvation_and_prejudice.html."

    "text": "The talented, systematic, hard-headed youth of our nation are put into business. We tell them that the object of business is to make money. Our dull, soft-headed, unsystematic youth we let stray into philanthropy to work for the good of men. Then we wonder at our inability to stop stealing. This is the great American paradox.\nSmall wonder that we see in our world two armies: one large and successful, well dressed and prosperous. They say bluntly: “We are not in business for our health—business pays!” The other army is seedy and diffident and usually apologetic. It says: “There are things that ought to be done, and we are trying to do them—philanthropy begs.” Between the business men, pure and simple, and the professional philanthropists waver the world’s hosts—physicians, lawyers, teachers, and servants, some regarding their work as philanthropy, most of them looking at it as business and testing its success by its pay. Business pays.\nPhilanthropy begs.\nBusiness is reality, philanthropy is dream: business first, philanthropy afterward—is this true? No, it is not. It is the foundation falsehood of our perverted social order.\nIn reality it is business enterprise that continually tends to defeat its own ability to pay and it is philanthropy that works to preserve a social order that will make the larger and broader and better business enterprises pay.\nWhat is meant when we say a business pays? Simply this: that for the service rendered or the thing given, the public will to-day pay a valued equivalent in services or goods. Men do this because of their present wants. Given a people wanting certain things and corresponding business enterprises follow. Will this demand continue? That depends: if the satisfaction of these wants minister to the real health and happiness of the community, the demand will continue and grow; if not, eventually either the business or the nation will die. The fact then that a business pays to-day is no criterion for the future. The liquor traffic pays and so does the publishing of school books; houses of prostitution pay and so do homes for renting purposes: and yet alcoholism and prostitution mean death while education and homes mean life to this land.\nThe amount then that a business pays is no test of its social value. It may pay and yet gradually destroy the larger part of all business enterprise. Here enters philanthropy. Its object is to do for men not what they want done, but that which, for their own health, they ought to want done. Will such service pay? Possibly it will: possibly the people will want the service as soon as they learn of it and lo! “Philanthropy and five per cent.” appears. More often, however, the people do not recognize the value of the new thing—do not want it; will not use baths or have anything to do with coffee rooms. Will they pay, then? If they perform a service necessary to human welfare and if the people are gradually learning what is really for their good, then sometimes such philanthropy pays. If it does not pay then the service offered was really unnecessary or the people to whom it was offered have ceased to advance toward betterment and are in danger of death.\nThe test, then, of business is philanthropy: that is, the question as to how far business enterprise is doing for men the things they ought to have done for them, when we consider not simply their present desires, but their future welfare. Just here it is that past civilizations have failed. Their economic organization catered to fatal wants and persisted in doing so, and refused to let philanthropy guide them. Just so to-day. Whenever a community seats itself helplessly before a dangerous public desire, or an ingrained prejudice, recognizing clearly its evil, but saying, “We must cater to it simply because it exists,” it is final; change is impossible. Beware; the epitaph of that people is being written.\nIt is just as contemptible for a man to go into the grocery business for personal gain as it is for a man to go into the ministry for the sake of the salary.\nThere is not a particle of ethical difference in the two callings. The legitimate object of both men is social service. The service of one is advice, inspiration and personal sympathy; the service of the other is fresh eggs and prompt delivery. Thus “from the blackening of boots to the whitening of souls” there stretches a chain of services to be done for the comfort and salvation of men.\nThose who are doing these things are doing holy work, and the work done, not the pay received, is the test of the working. Pay is simply the indication of present human appreciation of the work, but most of the world’s best work has been, and is being done, unappreciated.\n“Ah, yes,” says the cynic, “but do you expect men will work for the sake of working?” Yes, I do. That’s the reason most men work. Men want work. They love work. Only give them the work they love and they will ask no pay but their own soul’s “Well done!” True it is that it is difficult to assign to each of the world’s workers the work he loves; true it is that much of the world’s drudgery will ever be disagreeable; but pay will never destroy inherent distaste, nor (above the starvation line) will it form a greater incentive than social service, if we were but trained to think so.\nThese things are true, fellow-Americans; therefore, let us, with one accord, attack the bottom lie that supports graft and greed and selfishness and race prejudice: namely, that any decent man has at any time any right to adopt any calling or profession for the sole end of personal gain.\n“Surely,” gasp the thrifty, “the first duty of man is to earn a living!” This means that a man must at least do the world a service such as men, constituted as they are to-day, will requite with the necessities of life. This is true for some men always; perhaps for most men to-day. We pray for some sweet morning when it will be true for all men. But it was not true for Socrates, nor for Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPhilanthropy and Self Help (1918)\nWhite Charity (1922)\nOur Economic Future (1928)\nThe Right to Work (1933)\nOur Class Struggle (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Education.” The Crisis 2\n(2): 64–65. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/02/02/business.html."

    "text": "Few people who argue about the race problem know how that problem changes. Within the last twenty years this change has been so great that many fail to realize it, or if they do realize it more or less vaguely, they are puzzled at its new outcroppings. It seems to them as though this human difficulty was continually developing new and unexpected centers of trouble. As a matter of fact, however, what we have to-day might easily have been foreseen twenty years ago. We are having a change in the problem, but the change is logical and represents a more or less regular development.\nTo illustrate this let us remember what the argument against the Negro was in slavery days. It was said that he was an indolent tropical being who would not work without being driven and that it was utterly impossible that he should become a self-directing worker and work with initiative and a decent standard of life, and that if he were allowed to go free he would become a pauper or criminal, and very soon be extinct. This argument was thoroughly believed in by the mass of the best Southern people, and it undoubtedly did much to hold their hands back from all schemes of emancipation.\nAfter the war the South and its friends hastened to point out that exactly what they foretold was happening. Their accusation against the Negro race was inborn laziness, and most superficial students of the Negro problem have seen what they think is ocular evidence of this laziness; the loafing about depots of Southern railway stations, the unreliability of Negro help, etc. So that from emancipation for a period of perhaps ten or twenty years the argument against the Negro in this country took this form: The Negro is lazy and is relapsing into barbarism, the young folks born during and since slavery are utterly worthless, and the better slaves of the old regime are going to disappear.\nThere was some truth in these assertions, but friends of the black man pointed out that a sudden revolution had taken place in the economic and social relations of these men; that they had been taught laziness both by the tropical climate of their forefathers’ home and by slavery, and that the only real present dangers were the hindrances which race prejudice was putting in their way. Gradually in the last fifteen or twenty years an answer to this argument was evolved. It was frankly admitted that there was prejudice and intense prejudice in social relations, but that this prejudice had absolutely nothing to do with the Negro as a workingman, and that consequently the argument of prejudice was outside of the question; that it was simply a matter of laziness and was to be cured by thrift. The Negro people were told, therefore, to work hard and regularly, and save their money.\nIn this later argument, again, there was a tremendous amount of truth. Certainly the first thing that a freedman must learn is regular habits and labor. He has been taught by slavery that labor is a badge of serfdom. He must teach himself that labor is a necessity of life. Moreover, under the slave regime money was an infrequent commodity which was immediately to be spent; while under the responsibilities of a free labor system it must be accumulated in small lots and very carefully guarded and saved.\nWhile, however, this argument was strong and an argument that ought to have been made, it was not the argument that should have utterly displaced the insistence upon the evil of race prejudice. It was not too much to have asked intelligent people to foresee that race prejudice in the United States was going to hinder Negroes in getting work, and keep down their wages, and make it difficult for them to develop habits of thrift and to save. While on the one hand it was necessary, and imperatively necessary, that work and thrift should be insisted upon so far as Negroes were concerned, just as careful and widespread a campaign should have been carried on to see that the way before the faltering feet of the freedman was clear of hurtful and deadening prejudice. This necessity was not only not attended to but was even forgotten. The public have in later years come to be impatient of and observers to be optimistic and to dwell simply upon the shortcomings of the Negroes.\nWhat has been the result of this policy? In the first place so far as the Negroes are concerned there can be no doubt that their energies have more and more been given to work and thrift, and despite all the testimonies of car-window sociologists there is absolutely undisputed evidence that the Negro has accumulated property. Full statistics unfortunately do not exist to prove this assertion; so far as crime is concerned we can get statistics of Negroes in practically every State, county and city in the United States, but when it comes to property there are only available figures in three States, and only in one State have these figures gone back for a considerable period.\n\n\n\nAssessed Value of Colored Property in Georgia. (From Atlanta Univ. Pub No. 14)\n\n\nThe State of Georgia, beginning with 1874, has kept a careful account of the assessed value of the property owned by its Negro citizens. I have put on a chart the way in which that property has increased. It began at $6,000,000 in 1874, and did not increase for about six years, owing to the reconstruction troubles in this State. Then as gradually law and order were restored the accumulations began to go up, and once started they went very rapidly until they reached the culminating point in 1893. At that time the Negroes of Georgia were paying taxes on $14,000,000 worth of property. Then there came a check. First the panic of 1892, then a series of Jim Crow laws, four-cent cotton, and the epidemic of lynching. The result was that for five years the accumulations decreased or wavered. Then they took a new forward movement with the new century and went up rapidly until to-day the Negroes of Georgia pay taxes on about $30,000,000 worth of property. Moreover, as the assessments of property in Georgia are low, it is probable that this represents between $50,000,000 and $60,000,000 of actual value.\nI have also tried to indicate on the chart the increase per capita of Negro property by a dotted line, and I have put down the Atlanta riot and the campaign for disfranchisement to indicate to you what is very clear in my mind, that this campaign was carried on chiefly because the Negroes were getting on too well.\nOther States have made similar advancement, although there are fewer data. In Virginia, for instance, in 1891 Negroes paid taxes on $12,000,000 worth of property; in 1908 they paid taxes on $25,500,000. In North Carolina in 1900 Negroes paid taxes on nine and a third million dollars’ worth of property; in 1909 they paid taxes on $21,000,000 worth. Taking these three States together and considering simply the years 1900 to 1908 we find that in Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina colored people owned in 1900 $40,000,000 worth of taxable property, and in 1908 it had increased to $74,000,000. or an increase of 87 1/3 per cent.\nNot only this, but the census of 1900 made an attempt to get some figures of the ownership of property by Negroes as a whole. They found that the Negroes, both as owners and tenants, operated 750,000 farms, containing 60,000 square miles, and that the total value of the property thus under Negro control was $500,000,000. with annual products to the amount of $256,000,000. Of these 750,000 farms one-fourth were owned by colored people, and the number of owners increased nearly 60 per cent, between 1890 and 1900, and there is every reason to believe that between 1900 and 1910 the increase has been far more than 60 per cent., and that to-day Negroes own somewhere near one-third of the farms which they operate.\nTaking the 200,000 farms of the Negro owners we find that they, had in 1900 nearly 15,000,000 acres of land, which was worth $180,000,000, and raised $60,000,000 worth of products. All Negro farm property was estimated by the census to be worth about $230,000,000 ten years ago. The American Economic Association took up the subject, and concluded that the total property of the Negro race in 1900 was $300,000,000. If, however, the property has increased in the last ten years throughout the land in the same ratio as in Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, then it would be fair to infer that the property of the Negroes in the United States should be assessed at $600,000,000.\nCompared with the wealth of the United States these figures are small, but considered in the light of the fact that they represent the savings of a race that began practically without capital a generation ago, they are simply astounding. But what I want to point out to-day is that this accumulation has been made in the face of discouragements and violations of property rights such as no other class of Americans ever met. In the first place we must remember that it is the despised second generation since slavery that has made these accumulations and that these people have saved their money in the face of the following impediments:\n\nThe lack of facilities for saving, and deliberate cheating.\nThe hostility of local municipal policy.\nDiscrimination in wages.\nMob violence.\nLegal violence.\n\nI want to take up each one of these in turn.\nFirst, as to the lack of facilities for saving. Few people realize how difficult it is in the South for the poor man to save who wants to. Usually in the country districts there are but two methods open to him: To hoard his money or to hand it over to some white friend. There have been numberless cases where such white friends and patrons have taken care of the money of their Negro clients and acted as bankers, with the result that the colored man has been able to keep his savings secure and to accumulate. However, in an unfortunately large number of other cases the colored man has been cheated. Sometimes the patron has died suddenly and the client has been able to get no accounting from the heirs. This was peculiarly the case in regard to the property which free Negroes and favorite slaves accumulated before the war. In other cases the client has died and his heirs have been deliberately cheated by the natron. This has often been defended: Here is an old and favorite colored man whose property is kept by a white man. So long as he lives the property is safe in the white man’s hands. If he dies the white man decides that the children ought not have the property or do not deserve it, and takes it for his own purposes. In still other cases there is a deliberate attempt to cheat the client by false accounts or other devices. It is of course impossible to present figures to show the extent of this practice, but I have never been in a community in the South where the number of cases of deliberate cheating that could be pointed out was not simply appalling in frequency. I have great hopes in this respect of the Postal Savings Banks if the government will be careful not to put them all in the cities where they are not needed, but in the back country districts of the South.\nSecond, the hostility of municipal policy. Much has been said about the discrimination against Negroes by the State, and that in the South is large, but the real oppression in every-day life comes in the municipalities. The courts, for instance, are undoubtedly prejudiced against black men, but nevertheless it is possible in the higher State courts often to get substantial justice if the man has the money to take the case up. The legislatures are vicious in their attacks on Negro rights, but their doings are open to the public inspection of the whole United States, and must be somewhat curbed by law and public opinion. On the other hand, the action of the petty town, county and city governments is largely unnoticed and is often prejudiced and unfair to a degree almost unbelievable to those who do not know the facts. If, for instance, you go to an ordinary Southern town you are shown the Negro districts; the streets are unpaved; sidewalks are in a dilapidated condition; the drainage is bad; the garbage is not cared for, and the houses are dilapidated. Now. without doubt, part of this condition can be charged to the colored dwellers. but much of it is due to the deliberate refusal of the city to spend any public money on city improvements in the Negro district or to properly police this district. The Negro district is consequently not only without decent accommodations so far as the city is concerned, but it is at the mercy of the vicious, both of its own race and among the white race. There is scarcely a city in the South where the tenderloin district has not been deliberately placed in the Negro quarter and kept there despite the protest of the better class of Negroes. All this hurts Negro property and makes the investment of Negroes in property difficult. Moreover, the same thing that happens so often in the North is accentuated is this case, i.e., the small householder pays a disproportionately large share of the taxes as compared with the large householder or capitalist. The burden of taxation in Southern cities is shifted upon the small Negro property owner to an extent which is astounding. All this discourages accumulation and particularly discourages investment.\nMoreover, the gross and glaring injustice to Negroes in the lower courts makes it difficult and often impossible to defend their property rights. The magistrates and judges are usually elected for short terms, often on an anti-Negro platform, and are bitter and openly unfair.\nThird, wage discrimination. It is the deliberate policy of the South to pay Negroes less wages for the same work than they would pay white people, just as is the case in the North where they pay women less wages for the same work than they pay men. The argument in the South is that the Negro has a lower standard of life, and therefore does not need as much money. The discrimination varies from 25 to 50 per cent. This makes it more difficult for Negroes to save money, because, as a matter of fact, while their standard of living is lower than that of the average white person, it is rapidly rising, and the demand upon their meager income for better housing, better food and better clothing is such that the margin for saving is very small or entirely disappears.\nFourth, mob violence. Of all the hindrances enumerated—lack of facilities for saving, hostility of municipal policy and wage discrimination—none are such detriments to saving in the South as the fear of mob violence. It is hard to realize in a law-abiding community how the fear of physical violence broods in the air in the South. No Negro can feel himself safe from it. He cannot invest in property without taking it into account. In some cases it is impossible to get his property insured for this very reason, and almost always when for any reason there is an outbreak of great violence in the South, it is the Negro property holder who actually pays the bill. The result is that continually men who might otherwise invest in property refrain from doing this, and other colored men who invest do so with the idea of removing to the North just as soon as they get large enough investments. The feeling of insecurity against the jealousy and viciousness of certain Southern elements is daily in their minds. It is this feeling, too, that drives the Negro into the cities; there his property gets greater police protection because it cannot be destroyed without in some degree injuring the property of white owners or injuring the general credit of the community.inally, this kind of mob violence has gone so far that we are seeing attempts to-day to translate it into legal violence. Just as the cheating of the Negro out of his vote was done by extra legal methods at first, and now is done by methods called legal, so the cheating of Negroes out of their property rights is now about to be translated into some semblance of legal form. The whole question of segregation in property is coming up at a later session, and therefore does not fall within the province of this paper; but I wish to point out that segregation is the violating of property rights, and that it is as futile an attempt to solve the Negro problem as any of the previous subterfuges have been.\nIn the time of slavery we had the subterfuge of colonization to tempt the conscientious mind; in the time of reconstruction we had the subterfuge of threatened Negro domination to blind those who ought to have seen; in the days since Reconstruction we have had the subterfuge of industrial inefficiency to make people forget race prejudice. Today the world, north and south, is being asked to believe that the crux of the Negro problem lies in keeping black men from buying property on your street. All through this history of subterfuge and evasion has run the great and dominating fact of a racial prejudice which denies the application of the ethics of Jesus Christ in the relations of men if these men happen to be of a different race. It is the object of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to impress the fact upon the American people that the foundation difficulty of the race problem is this despicable race prejudice, and that unless we attack this central difficulty we never shall settle this problem. Moreover, we insist that this problem must be settled and settled right, because it is but a part of a greater problem which is as wide as the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Statement (1919)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nWork for Black Folk in 1914 (1914)\nToward a New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Violations of Property Rights.”\nThe Crisis 2 (1): 28–22. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/02/01/violations.html."

    "text": "The nemesis of every forward movement in the United States is the Negro question.\nWitness Woman Suffrage, the Liquor Question, Political Reform, the various efforts to revivify the Christian Church, and Socialism. Mrs. Anna Shaw, president of the Woman’s Suffrage Association of America, recently made the extraordinary statement that all Negroes were opposed to woman suffrage. This is, of course, a barefaced falsehood. But assuming that Mrs. Shaw believes it true, what is Mrs. Shaw’s conclusion? The traveler from Altruria might assume that she would say:\n“Therefore let us work to enlighten these colored men and women and show them that disfranchisement, whether by sex or race, is wrong.” Not so does the astute Mrs. Shaw advise. On the contrary, she says: “Do not touch the Negro problem. It will offend the South.” This is the advice that is generally given to an organization which sings in its recently adopted hymn:\n\nWe the People! All the People! How it rings! Justice broad and free, the living heart of things! Sisters working for the light, Brothers striving for the right, We the People! All the People! How it rings!\n\nSuch contradiction hurts the Woman’s Suffrage movement far more than it hurts black folk. The strength of the woman’s movement in England is that it is honest and unselfish, aristocrat and working woman working hand in hand. But in America, despite the brave effort of women like Mrs. Belmont and Mrs. Villard, the war cry is rapidly becoming “Votes for White Women Only.”\nNo wonder Europe sneers at American democracy. Small wonder that we ourselves lose the faith in ourselves which we so sorely need. We would like to believe that a great uplift movement of young people who profess to follow the precepts of Jesus Christ would first of all condemn murder, lynching and lawlessness in this land. As a matter of fact, the recent national meeting of the Christian Endeavorers refused even to consider such a resolution. Yet this was the organization that made the welkin ring last year to prevent the exhibit of a black man’s victory in a prizefight\nConsider again the effort of the South to regulate the sale of liquor. “The Negroes oppose us,” many Southerners complain. This is untrue. A very large proportion of the Negro vote can be counted on to oppose the liquor traffic. But suppose that many or all did oppose certain prohibitory laws, the remedy would be to educate and persuade those voters. But no, the “reformers,” who for eleven months in the year take every opportunity to show their contempt for a black face, suddenly a few weeks before election order the Negro voters to vote for their measures on pain of further disfranchisement. When some Negroes refuse to do this, we are told in triumphant tones that Negroes are not worthy of the ballot!\nOf all recent forward movements the Socialists have rung truest on the race question in their theoretical statements. But here they have usually stopped. “Why do not Negroes join the Socialists?” they ask. They do not ask such silly questions of white folks: They go and see why they do not join. They teach, agitate and proselyte; while among ten million Negro Americans they have scarcely a single worker and are afraid to encourage such workers. All of which goes to show that the Negro problem is the door which bars progress in the United States and which makes us liars and hypocrites. Yet the unloosening of that door is the simplest thing on earth: Treat human beings according to their character and not according to their color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nThe Justice of Woman Suffrage (1912)\nAgility (1915)\nSex Equality (1920)\nSocial Equality (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Forward Backward.”\nThe Crisis 2 (6): 243–44. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/02/06/forwardbackward.html."

The most glaring example of this is, of course, the tariff, but his attitude toward the American Negro is a . fatal second. Not only is Mr. Taft particeps minims with the late Mr. Roosevelt in the crime of Brownsville, but he added to that the Taft Doctrine of recognizing race prejudice, instead of fitness, in Federal appointments. On top of this, and in the face of a record of murder, lynching and burning in this country which has appalled the civilized world and loosened the tongue of many a man long since dumb on the race problem, in spite of this, Mr. Taft has blandly informed a deputation of colored men that any action on his part is quite outside his power, if not his interest.\nFinally, Mr. Taft has several times expressed himself on Negro education. First he was quite enthusiastic for the education of the Negroes’ hands. Then—on the eve of his nomination to the presidency—he discovered at Fisk University a few black brains that deserved cultivation, but sparingly—sparingly. He would not overdo this sort of thing. Lately, on the eve of his campaign of renomination to the presidency, Mr. Taft has again declared that the Negro “ought to come and is coming more and more under the guardianship of the South!” This statement is, to speak mildly, extraordinary; and it will make thinking black men carefully considerate as to whether they are willing to enthrone this policy in the White House for another four years.\nLet us examine the dictum: When a guardian is appointed it is because he has shown in the past some capacity for the position. One would not usually ask a murderer to guard life, nor a slave driver to direct labor, nor a libertine to protect girls. Or if by chance such an one is so appointed, it could only be that despite a forbidding past he had shown unmistakable signs of repentance, and will and ability to do right. We ask now in all charity and calmness: Have the Southern States of this land in the past or in the present exhibited any desire or ability to settle the Negro problem in accordance with reason and justice? The answer lies in nine burning words:\n\nSlavery\nPeonage\nMulattoes\nMurder\nMobs\nLynching\nDisfranchisement\nIlliteracy\nPrejudice\n\nWe submit to any unprejudiced judge that a people that have shown no greater capacity for dealing with a great social problem than these fearful words indicate are not fit to be given sole and exclusive charge of ten million cattle much less ten million human souls.\nAnd we further declare that a man who in the light of the history of this land can stand up and deny to the conscience and ability of the North and West any right to help in the settlement of a problem which belongs to them just as much as it belongs to the South, if not more—we declare that such a man has no business to be President of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Election (1912)\nThe Flag (1911)\nMr. Roosevelt (1912)\nThe President (1915)\nWilliam Monroe Trotter (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Mr. Taft.” The Crisis 2\n(6): 243. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/02/06/taft.html."

    "text": "For a century or more it has been the dream of those who do not believe Negroes are human that their wish should find some scientific basis. For years they depended on the weight of the human brain, trusting that the alleged underweight of less than a thousand Negro brains, measured without reference to age, stature, nutrition or cause of death, would convince the world that black men simply could not be educated. Today scientists acknowledge that there is no warrant for such a conclusion and that in any case the absolute weight of the brain is no criterion of racial ability.\nMeasurements of the bony skeleton followed and great hopes of the scientific demonstration of race inferiority were held for a while. But they had to be surrendered when Zulus and Englishmen were found in the same dolichocephalic class.\nThen came psychology: the children of the public schools were studied and it was discovered that some colored children ranked lower than white children. This gave wide satisfaction even though it was pointed out that the average included most of both races and that considering the educational opportunities and social environment of the races the differences were measurements simply of the ignorance and poverty of the black child’s surroundings.\nToday, however, all is settled. “A workably accurate scientific classification of brain power” has been discovered and by none other than our astute army officers.

Then sudvdenly it doubled in a single decade to 40,339 in 1910 and in the last decade they have been arriving at the rate of over 5,000 a year. At present there are probably more than 100,000 foreign born Negroes in the United States, two-thirds of whom are from the West Indies and adjacent parts of South America.\nThese facts make it increasingly necessary for us to understand this new ally in the fight for black democracy. We are naturally provincial in North America and we easily forget that our 12 million Negroes are but one-half the Negro population of the New World. To our own numbers we must add 6,000,000 in the West Indies, and 9,OOO,OOO in Central and South America.\nMoreover the Negro problem as seen by Negroes in the Islands and the other Americas differs from our problem and differs in such ways as to make misunderstanding very easy. In most of South America the solution of the race problem is found in amalgamation with the whites and where that is going on there is little migration to America. However, in centers like Jamaica, Haiti and Guiana, where there are comparatively few whites, a racial consciousness has been developed which not only does not find amalgamation but does not desire it. In Haiti this feeling made a nation. In Jamaica, Guiana and elsewhere it is today asserting itself in a great surge of activity. Migration to other islands and to North America has been large and the war has fostered widespread discontent.\nEspecially have the islands become disgusted with their old leadership. These leaders were largely mulattoes and it was British policy to induce them by carefully distributed honors and preferment to identify their interests completely with the whites. The visitor to Jamaica sees no color line jn politics or society but he easily fails to note that the great mass of Negro peasantry has no real economic leadership or sympathy but is left to toil at a wretched wage and under disgraceful conditions.\nIt is this mass of peasants, uplifted by war and migration, that is today beginning to assert itself at home and abroad, and their new cry of “Africa for the Africans” strikes with a startling surprise upon America’s darker millions. The movement is as yet inchoate and indefinite, but it is tremendously human, piteously sincere and built in the souls of a hardworking, thrifty, independent people, who while long deprived of higher training have nevertheless very few illiterates or criminals. It is not beyond possibilities that this new Ethiopia of the Isles may yet stretch out hands of helpfulness to the 12 million black men of America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWest Indian Immigration (1924)\nPan-Africa and New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nThe Census (1911)\nDeath Rates (1927)\nBrazil (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “The Rise of the West Indian.”\nThe Crisis 20 (5): 214--215. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/20/05/rise_of_the_west_indian.html."

Four parties ask our votes.\nThe Republican party has for 25 years joined the white South in disfranchising us; it has permitted us to be “Jim-Crowed,” deprived of schools and segregated. It has partially disfranchised us in its party councils and proposes practically to eliminate us as soon as this campaign is over. It has encouraged and recognized the “Lily-White” factions and nearly driven us from public office. In addition to this the Republicans represent reaction and privilege, the abolition of freedom of speech, the punishment of thinkers, the suppression of the labor movement, the encouragement and protection of trusts, and a new protective tariff to tax the poor for the benefit of the rich.\nThe Democratic party stands for exactly the same things as the Republicans. Between their professed and their actual policies there is no difference worth noting. To be sure, the northern wing of the party has tendencies toward some recognition of the laborers’ demands and the needs of a stricken war-cursed world, but this is more than neutralized by the Solid South.\nThe Solid South means lynching, oligarchy, mob-rule, disfranchisement, systematic ignorance and rotten-borough voting. Against this body of death the highest ideals of Woodrow Wilson at his best availed absolutely nothing, and there is not today the shadow of a hope that Governor Cox of Ohio would be able to champion any policy as president that proposes to disturb the rule in the South of the conscienceless exploiter of black and white labor.\nThis is the position of the two chief parties, one of which is bound to win.\nThere are two other parties, the Farmer-Labor and the Socialist. Both these parties speak out bravely in our behalf. Neither of them can win and because of our defenseless position the triumph of one of the greater parties without our aid might be the signal for further aggressions upon our rights as citizens. Our one clear path is this: Whatever vote we cast for president, let our vote for Congressmen be clear and decisive: vote for friends of our race and defeat our enemies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro Party (1916)\nThe Negro in Politics (1929)\nPolitical Straws (1923)\nVotes (1919)\nVote (1924)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “How Shall We Vote.”\nThe Crisis 20 (5): 235--236. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/20/05/how_shall_we_vote.html."

    "text": "On March 25, 1920, the following law was passed by the Mississippi Legislature:\n\nAn act to make it a misdemeanor to print or publish or circulate printed or published appeals or presentations of arguments or suggestions favoring social equality or marriage between the white and Negro races.\nSection I: Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Mississippi that any person publishing or circulating printed, typewritten or written matter urging or presenting for public acceptance or general information, arguments or suggestions in favor of social equality or of intermarriage between whites and Negroes, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of not exceeding five hundred dollars or imprisonment not exceeding six months or both fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court.\nSection II: That this act take effect and be in force from and after its passage.\n\nOne of our agents in Mississippi is the Reverend E.R. Franklin of Jackson. He is, according to one of the best known citizens of the state, “a splendid type of the upstanding conservative young Negro of the South. He has been preaching and teaching school for a number of years, and in every place has been well liked by the white people.”\nOn Sunday, April 18, Mr. Franklin was on a Yazoo and Mississippi Valley train going from Jackson to Tchula, where he was to settle the estate of a deceased sister. He had a few copies of The Crisis with him containing the article by William Pickens on our soldiers in France. He had let one or two passengers have copies. “Soon after he had let these passengers have the copies, the conductor came up and asked to see a copy also, which he handed him.\n\nHe says that he thought no more of it until upon his arrival in Tchula, he was met at the station by a mob who threw guns in his face and began to beat him; that after the mob had beaten him most severely, some having a rope crying “lynch him,” the counsel of one certain man in the crowd to only whip him, but not to kill him, prevailed.\nAnd when this mob got through with him, they ordered him to get on up the railroad track out of town or they would kill him; so he then began in his weakened, dazed condition, as best he could, to get up the road. This was about dusk, and he had not gotten far before he looked around and saw either the same or another mob coming after him. And Tchula being practically in a swamp and about wholly surrounded by high water at that time, he slid from the railroad track down into the swamp and stood in the thickets and in water above his waist, with his overcoat thrown over his head to camouflage himself as nearly as possible as an old tree snag.\nLater, in the thick of darkness, he eased out of the water into the field, and sat there for the remainder of the night with his overcoat still thrown over his head, camouflaged as a stump.\nThe mob came in great numbers and threw flashlights and whooped and howled like demons for quite a while but never detected him. Later a terrible rain storm came up and they had to disperse for the night. He remained in his camouflaged state, under this awful downpour and thunderstorm all night; and at daybreak the next morning, crawled back to the railroad track, and there met a white man whom he told what had happened, and asked this white man to assist him to an officer that he might seek protection.\nThis man took him back to Tchula and there they went to the justice of the peace and told him what had happened. Thereupon, the justice of the peace had an affidavit sworn out against him.\n\nOn the strength of this affidavit and without trial or indictment he was forthwith sentenced to a fine of $400 and five months on the county chain gang.\nHis bail was placed at $1000 and in less than 30 minutes colored friends in Jackson subscribed $2,500.\n\nWe then employed a lawyer here to go to Tchula and tender the bond, whereupon a crowd of three hundred men met the lawyer soon after his arrival in Tchula and threatened to mob him if he dared represent Franklin; and the justice of the peace who declined the bond, (though it had been properly certified to by the sheriff and thereby proven valid as required by the law), told the lawyer that Franklin would be lynched if released and that his only salvation would be to permit him to work out the sentence.\n\nThe N.A.A.C.P. then wired the Governor and received from the acting Lieutenant-Governor, H. H. Casteel, a reply, saying: “The mildness of his sentence was because of his ignorance. If the editors of this sheet would visit Mississippi we would make an example of them that would be a lasting benefit to the colored people of the South and would not soon be forgotten.”\nAnother telegram was despatched and efforts made to get other lawyers. Governor Russell replied saying, April 26: “I am not advised about the facts of the case but I am sure that the people of the state will see that the law is enforced and every right guaranteed under the law to any citizen is respected; however, let me add that I am sure this party got out very light, if I am properly advised, and that the law has been vindicated by the punishment he has received.\n\nLet me also add that I fully indorse the telegram of Acting Governor Casteel, and when this man or any man comes into the state or into any state and advocates social equality and intermarriage of the Negro race with the white race he is doing that which should be condemned by both races alike.\n\nOn April 27 Franklin was released on bond and arrived in Jackson, April 28. He will be tried at Lexington, Miss., at the next term of the circuit court in the fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe White Primary (1911)\nSenators’ Records (1914)\nSouthern Papers (1911)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nThe Next Step (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “Mississippi.” The Crisis 20\n(2): 69–71. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/20/02/mississippi.html."

Are we getting ready for this mighty change? Are we consulting and laying plans? The white South is. There is already some open discussion among newspapers and a feverish discussion in secret societies and behind closed doors after the servants retire. The South proposes to keep colored women from voting in exactly the same way in which it has disfranchised colored men. Can it do it? Are we going to let it do it?\nThe Southerners will be handicapped by the “Grandfather” decision of the Supreme Court, but they will rely upon our apathy and the policy of “Sh! Don’t agitate—we are your friends!” They will marshall every black Judas and traitor to “advise” us to remain slaves.\nGet ready, fellow Negroes, and set your faces like flint. Resolve on two things: (1) to call no man Friend, white or black, who advises you not to exercise the right to vote; (2) if by force and fraud a new disfranchisement is fastened on the South, to publish the facts to the civilized world, to choke the courts with case upon case, to appeal, agitate and protest and to let no threat of poverty, riot or murder turn you from a determination to cast your vote according to law.\nGet ready! Know the law. Obey the law. If the law says that only intelligent women may vote, let the intelligent colored women register and vote. If voting is restricted by property, let those who have property register and vote.

    "text": "We trust the Negro world has watched with intelligent comprehension the extraordinary conjunction of Church and Steel in recent events. When the Interchurch movement came The Crisis was dumb with astonishment. Was it possible that the white followers of Jesus Christ were actually going to forget Infant Damnation and Justification by Faith long enough to work together for education, the abolition of child labor, opposition to race prejudice, co-operation in national missionary effort, social uplift and fair wages? As the survey progressed and the Negro and Africa were included and, too, not in the appendix, it looked as though the Christian Church was about to be reborn.\nOf course, we expected the white southern Baptists to refuse co-operation. They are too much interested in lynching and immersion to heed the call of the black and the poor. But the movement grew and swelled and swept until it struck hard Steel. Until it struck Steal.\nRich holders of steel securities in northern churches were exactly like hirers of black and disfranchised Negro peons in southern churches. “Hands off” is their common cry when you touch “wages and unions” or “the Negro problem”. These two things have “nothing to do with religion”.\nSo when the Interchurch movement investigated the Steel strike, where Negroes, underpaid and disfranchised in the South, were induced to “scab” in Pennsylvania and Ohio and break the ranks of Union labor, and when it was proven that Mr. Gary or somebody lied and lied roundly and extensively — this was too much. The Interchurch movement was suddenly found extravagant. First, the perfect Presbyterians withdrew their spotless skirts and then in a weird procession followed criticism, rumor and withdrawal until at last the white Church shrank in horror from this smoking Hell of Steel. Christianity again was crucified.

He had to pause for the audience guffawed in wild merriment. Why?\nIt was a colored audience. Many of them were black. Some black faces there were as beautiful as the night.\nWhy did they laugh?\nBecause the world had taught them to be ashamed of their color.\nBecause for 500 years men had hated and despised and abused black folk.\nAnd now in strange, inexplicable transposition the rising blacks laugh at themselves in nervous, blatant, furtive merriment.\nThey laugh because they think they are expected to laugh—because all their poor hunted lives they have heard “black” things laughed at.\nOf all the pitiful things of this pitiful race problem, this is the pitifulest. So curious a mental state tends to further subtleties. Colored folk, like all folk, love to see themselves in pictures; but they are afraid to see the types which the white world has caricatured. The whites obviously seldom picture brown and yellow folk, but for five centuries they have exhausted every ingenuity of trick, of ridicule and caricature on black folk: “grinning” Negroes, “happy” Negroes, “gold dust twins,” “Aunt Jemimas,” “solid” headed tacks—everything and anything to make Negroes ridiculous. As a result if The Crisis puts a black face on its cover our 500,000 colored readers do not see the actual picture—they see the caricature that white folks intend when they make a black face. In the last few years a thoughtful, clear eyed artist, Frank Walts, has done a number of striking portraits for The Crisis. Mainly he has treated black faces; and regularly protests have come to us from various colored sources. His lovely portrait of the bright-eyed boy, Harry Elam, done in thoughtful sympathy, was approved by few Negroes. Our photograph of a woman of Santa Lucia, with its strength and humor and fine swing of head, was laughed at by many.\nWhy?\n“O—er—it was not because they were black,” stammer some of my office companions, “but they are too black. No people were ever so——”\nNonsense! Do white people complain because their pictures are too white? They ought to, but they do not. Neither do we complain if we are photographed a shade “light”.\nNo. It is not that we are ashamed of our color and blood. We are instinctively and almost unconsciously ashamed of the caricatures done of our darker shades. Black is caricature in our half conscious thought and we shun in print and paint that which we love in life. How good a dark face looks to us in a strange white city! How the black soldiers, despite their white French sweethearts, yearned for their far-off “brown-skins”. A mighty and swelling human consciousness is leading us joyously to embrace the darker world, but we remain afraid of black pictures because they are the cruel reminders of the crimes of Sunday “comics” and “Nigger” minstrels.\nOff with these thought-chains and inchoate soul-shrinkings, and let us train ourselves to see beauty in black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPrecept and Practice (1910)\nThe True Brownies (1919)\nThe Colored Audience (1916)\nPan-Africa and New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nTriumph (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “In Black.” The Crisis 20\n(6): 263–66. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/20/06/in_black.html."

Ever the weary worldlings seek some easier, quicker way—the Way of Wealth, of Privilege, of Chance, of Power; but in the end all that they get—Food, Raiment, Palace and Pleasure—is the result of Toil, but not always of their own toil. The great cry of world Justice today is that the fruit of toil go to the Laborer who produces it. In this labor of Production we recognize effort of all sorts—lifting, digging, carrying, measuring, thinking, foreseeing; but we are refusing to recognize Chance, Birth or Monopoly as just grounds for compelling men to serve men.\nIn this fight for Justice to Labor the Negro looms large. In Africa and the South Seas, in all the Americas and dimly in Asia he is a mighty worker and potentially, perhaps, the mightiest. But of all laborers cheated of their just wage from the world’s dawn to today, he is the poorest and bloodiest.\nIn the United States he has taken his fastest forward step, rising from owned slave to tied serf, from servant to day laborer, from scab to half-recognized union man in less than a century. Armies, mobs, lynchers, laws and customs have opposed him, yet he lurches forward. His very so called indolence is his dimly-conceived independence; his singing soul is his far-flaming ideal; and nothing but organized and persistent murder and violence can prevent him from becoming in time the most efficient laboring force in the modern world.\nMeantime, in the world round him, the battle of Industrial Democracy is being fought and the white laborers who are fighting it are not sure whether they want their black fellow laborer as ally or slave. If they could make him a slave, they probably would; but since he can underbid their wage, they slowly and reluctantly invite him into the union. But can they bring themselves inside the Union to regard him as a man—a fellow-voter, a brother?\nNo—not yet. And there lies the most stupendous labor problem of the twentieth century—transcending the problem of Labor and Capital, of Democracy, of the Equality of Women—for it is the problem of the Equality of Humanity in the world as against white domination of black and brown and yellow serfs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro and Labor (1922)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nEugene Debs (1926)\nThe Drive (1922)\nThe Migration (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “Labor Omnia Vincit.”\nThe Crisis 18 (5): 231–32. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/05/labor_omnia_vincit.html."

We know our problem and tend to radical thought in its solution, but do we strive to know the problems of other forward forging groups whose difficulties are inevitably intertwined with ours?\nHere, for instance, is the question of the ownership of public utilities—the railroads, the telegraph and telephone and the street cars—utilities used largely, if not primarily, by the working class, and businesses which have yielded immense fortunes to private owners in the past.\nWhat do we think of these questions—are we studying them? Are we intelligent on the facts? Do we know that the United States is almost the only civilized country that does not own its railroads and wires, and that the municipal ownership of street transportation is widespread?\nOr take the battle of North Dakota under the Non-Partisan League; are we swallowing easily the gossip of a prejudiced press,or do we realize that these western farmers are resolutely grappling with the mightiest problem of present-day life—how to prevent the necessities of the poor from being simply the opportunity of predatory wealth to amass dangerous fortunes? North Dakota is putting her government into the business of banking and publishing, running grain elevators and stockyards, packing-houses and flour mills and overseeing mines. Will she fail? Perhaps, but her efforts are worth watching, and failure never yet proved wrong right.\nBeyond these questions lie the Suffering Groups—Ireland, India, Russia.\nFrom long tradition—since the draft riots of the Civil War—Negroes have had no sympathy with the Irish. But they must not rest in this unreason. Let every colored man read this month a history of Ireland. If he does not rise from it bitter with English cruelty and hypocrisy, he is callous indeed.\nThe cry of oppressed India sounds right in our own land in the persistent attempts of England to secure the transportation of Hindus accused of the treason of trying to make their country free.\nAnd, finally, the one new Idea of the World War—the idea which may well stand in future years as the one thing that made the slaughter worth while—is an Idea which we are like to fail to know because it is today hidden under the maledictions hurled at Bolshevism.\nIt is not the murder, the anarchy, the hate, which for years under Czar and Revolution have drenched this weary land, but it is the vision of great dreamers that only those who work shall vote and rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLa Follette (1924)\nViolations of Property Rights (1911)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nThe Railroads (1918)\nEast St. Louis (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “Forward.” The Crisis 18\n(5): 234–35. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/05/forward.html."

    "text": "I reached Washington early in the evening of July 22. As the train neared the capital I could feel the tenseness of the situation grow. It showed itself in the air of the passengers as they read the newspapers, with their glaring headlines telling of the awful night before and intimating that the worst was yet to come. As I passed through the cars on my way to the diner and back, men and women glanced up at me with what seemed to be a look with a glance which of mild surprise; seemed to say, “This man must indeed have very important business in Washington.”\nThe porters and waiters plainly showed the strain under which they were doing their work—the strain of suppressed excitement with, perhaps, an added sense of dread of going into something, they knew not what. They moved about quietly, in fact, grimly and entirely without their customary good humor and gaiety. One of the porters who knew who I was questioned the wisdom of my going through with the trip. I may have felt that his question was not absolutely without reason, but I did not admit it. When I left the car he said to me, “Take good care of yourself.” I assured him that I would spare no effort to do so.\nI had made many trips to Washington—some as a mere visitor, some as a member of the Government’s Foreign Service, some for the purpose of placing for the National Association matters affecting the race before men high in authority and position; and so I had experienced varied emotions on making the trip to the Nation’s Capital, but none like the emotions experienced on this trip. I knew it to be true, but it was almost an impossibility for me to realize as a truth that men and women of my race were being mobbed, chased, dragged from street cars, beaten and killed within the shadow of the dome of the Capitol, at the very front door of the White House. It was almost an impossibility for me to realize that, perhaps, my own life would not be safe on the public streets.\nWhen we reached the Northwest Section of the city, I found the whole atmosphere entirely different. I had expected to find the colored people excited and, perhaps, panicky; I found them calm and determined, unterrified and unafraid. Although on the night before shots had blazed all through the night at the corners of Seventh and T Streets and Fourteenth and U, I could detect no signs of nervousness on the part of the colored people living in the section. They had reached the determination that they would defend and protect themselves and their homes at the cost of their lives, if necessary, and that determination rendered them calm.\nStill, under the outward calm, there was a tautness that could be sensed. Wild rumors had been circulating all day foreboding terrible things; and these things, whatever they might be, the colored people had made up their minds to meet. But as darkness came on, the rain began to fall, and later it fell in torrents; so it may be that the rain had something to do with the things that did not happen.\nThat evening I met with a half-dozen of the influential colored men of the city. We talked over what had happened and discussed the steps already taken by the authorities and by the colored citizens and such steps as we thought it well to take on the following day.\nThe next morning Mr. Seligmann and I had a conference with Major Pullman, Chief of Police, regarding the protection of colored citizens. At this interview Mr. Seligmann secured for the information of the National Office and for purposes of publicity data regarding all the alleged cases of attacks on women which had been put forward as the cause of the riots. Our conference with Major Pullman lasted an hour; he expressed a desire to have us talk with Commissioner Brownlow and made an appointment with him for us at two o’clock in the afternoon. Before we left Major Pullman’s office a committee consisting of Dr. A. M. Curtis, young Dr. Curtis and Mr. Emmett J. Scott, accompanied by Captain Doyle of the 8th Police Precinct, came to ask that the Police Department swear in a number of colored men as Special Officers to aid in preserving law and order. Mr. Seligmann and I remained and gave our support to the committee. However, it was plain that Major Pullman was not favorable to the plan. He suggested that the committee take the matter up with his superior, Commissioner Brownlow. Mr. Seligmann and I then informed the committee of our appointment with the Commissioner at two o’clock, and invited them to go.\nIn the afternoon we had a long conference with Commissioner Brownlow. The whole situation was gone over, and the plan of commissioning colored men as Special Officers was brought up. The Commissioner was stronger in his opposition than the Chief of Police.\nIn the evening I attended a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Washington Branch to learn what the branch had done and was doing, and to offer such suggestions as I might. I found that the branch had been active as far back as July 9, when it sent a strong letter to all four of the Washington daily papers, calling their attention to the fact that they were sowing the seeds of a race riot by their inflammatory headlines and sensational news articles. After the outbreak of the riots a committee had been appointed which went before Commissioners Brownlow and Gardner and before Major Pullman to urge that effective action be taken to prevent assaults upon defenseless colored people who were the victims of the attacks. Members of the Legal Committee had spent considerable time in court in connection with the trials of the men who had been arrested for carrying weapons for their protection. A committee was set at work obtaining affidavits from victims of the riot who had been wounded or injured. And at this meeting the Legal Committee was authorized to interview all colored persons charged with rioting and offer them legal assistance.\nOn the following morning I went to the Capitol and talked at length with three influential Senators. I went over the whole situation, not only local, but national, with these Senators, and did my best to show them what I considered to be the principal causes of the trouble. I also spoke to each one of them regarding a Congressional investigation of the whole question of mob violence. I was able to secure from one of these Senators, who has been in Congress for twenty-five years and is a member with experience and prestige, and who is also a strong advocate of justice for the Negro, the promise that he would father a resolution calling for such an investigation and a printed report on the same.\nIn the afternoon I went to the office of the Washington Post and talked with the city editor. It was the Post which on Monday morning had published the “Mobilization for Tonight” call to the idle service men in Washington to meet near the Knights of Columbus hut on Pennsylvania Avenue, and organize a “clean up.” When I handed the city editor my card, he appeared glad to see me. He seemed to be under the impression that I had come down from New York for the express purpose of telling the colored people in Washington to be “good.” He called a reporter and asked me to tell him what the Association was doing and proposed to do in the matter.\nI lost no time in telling him that the organization which I represented stood for law and order; that all the fights it had made in behalf of the colored people had been made through and under the law; but that my reason for calling on him was not to discuss that phase of the situation. I then proceeded to tell him frankly and directly how responsible were the Washington Post and the other Washington dailies for what had taken place.\nI talked with him for, perhaps, half an hour. During the whole time he stood as one struck dumb; at least, he answered not a word. I realized that the man was scared through and through. He asked me before I left if I thought the riots were over. I told him I thought they were, unless the whites again took the aggressive. I was surprised to see the next morning that the Post published some of the things I had said.\nThe next day, accompanied by Mr. R. C. Bruce, I made similar visits to the offices of the Washington Times and the Washington Star. In the afternoon I talked again with one of my Senators. At night I left for New York.\nI returned disquieted, but not depressed over the Washington riot; it might have been worse. It might have been a riot in which the Negroes, unprotected by the law, would not have had the spirit to protect themselves.\nThe Negros saved themselves and saved Washington by their determination not to run, but to fight—fight in defense of their lives and their homes. If the white mob had gone on unchecked—and it was only the determined effort of black men that checked it—Washington would have been another and worse East St. Louis.\nAs regrettable as are the Washington and the Chicago riots, I feel that they mark the turning point in the psychology of the whole nation regarding the Negro problem. James Weldon Johnson.\nMajor J. E. SPINGARN reached Chicago, on his way to the West, July 30 and for twenty-four hours did active work for the Association. At his suggestion a committee called on Governor Lowden, on July 30, and among other matters discussed the appointment of a commission of five or eight to study race troubles and to formulate a definite program on race relations for the state,\nOn July 30 Mr. John R. Shillady, Secretary, and Mr. Herbert J. Seligmann, Director of Publicity, reached Chicago and at once plunged into work relating to the riots. A great amount of publicity in the daily press under the Association’s name is due to Mr. Seligmann’s tireless work. Mr. Shillady sends the following notes:\n\nThere was formed upon my initiative a Joint Emergency Committee to deal with the situation as regards the needs of the colored community, in so far as all elements will work through this committee. This committee is a committee of an executive character, on matters of policy and action, but leaving constituent organizations free to do such part of the work as they may be willing and able to do. The committee consists of one each from the Cook County Bar Association (colored lawyers’ organization), the Urban League, the Y. M. C. A., the N.A.A.C.P. and Ministers-Social Workers Citizens Conference, the last a group which has been meeting daily at Olivet Baptist Church, 31st and South Park Avenue. Further, each representative member is to have an alternative, so that some one will always be available to meet as often as is required.\n\nThe lawyers furnish free one of their number to be at each police station and court every morning, to take charge of the legal defense of any colored person needing such service. Headquarters have been arranged for at Olivet Baptist Church, where two lawyers, at least one stenographer, and necessary investigators, paid and volunteer, will be stationed to receive relatives and friends of men in jail and under arrest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTulsa Riots (1921)\nPersecution (1920)\nA Matter of Manners (1920)\nPreparedness (1915)\nThe Gall of Bitterness (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJames Weldon, Johnson. 1919. “The Riots: An N.A.A.C.P.\nInvestigation.” The Crisis 18 (5): 241–44. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/05/riots.html."

This war has disillusioned millions of fighting white men—disillusioned them with its frank truth of dirt, disease, cold, wet and discomfort; murder, maiming and hatred. But the disillusion of Negro American troops was more than this, or rather it was this and more—the flat, frank realization that however high the ideals of America or however noble her tasks, her great duty as conceived by an astonishing number of able men, brave and good, as well as of other sorts of men, is to hate “niggers.”\nNot that this double disillusion has for a moment made black men doubt the wisdom of their wholehearted help of the Allies. Given the chance again, they would again do their duty—for have they not seen and known France? But these young men see today with opened eyes and strained faces the true and hateful visage of the Negro problem in America.\nLt. Bakane Diop, a Chief of the Senegalese and Chevalier of the Legion of Honor\nWhen the German host—grey, grim, irresistible, poured through Belgium, out of Africa France called her sons; they came; 280,000 black Senegalese, first and last—volunteers, not drafted; they hurled the Boches back across the Ourcq and the Marne on a ghastly bridge of their own dead. It was The Crisis—four long, bitter years the war wore on; but Germany was beaten at the first battle of the Marne, and by Negroes. Beside the Belgians, too, stood, first and last, 30,000 black Congolese, not to mention the 20,000 black English West Indians who fought in the East and the thousands of black troops who conquered German Africa."

    "section": "Stevedores",
    "text": "Stevedores\nBut the story of stories is that of the American Negro. Here was a man who bravely let his head go where his heart at first could not follow, who for the first time as a nation within a nation did his bitter duty because it was his duty, knowing what might be expected, but scarcely foreseeing the whole truth.\nWe gained the right to fight for civilization at the cost of being “Jim-Crowed” and insulted; we were segregated in the draft; we were segregated in the first officers’ training camp; and we were allowed to volunteer only as servants in the Navy and as common laborers in the Army, outside of the four regular Negro regiments. The Army wanted stevedores, road builders, wood choppers, railroad hands, etc., and American Negroes were among the first to volunteer. Of the 200,000 Negroes in the American Expeditionary Force, approximately 150,000 were stevedores and laborers, doing the hardest work under, in some cases, the most trying conditions faced by any soldiers during the war. And it is the verdict of men who know that the most efficient and remarkable service has been rendered by these men. Patient, loyal, intelligent, not grouchy, knowing all that they were up against among their countrymen as well as the enemy, these American black men won the war as perhaps no other set of S.O.S. men of any other race or army won it.\nWhere were these men stationed? At some English ports; at many of the interior depots and bases; at the various France and in places where automobiles, airplanes, cars and locomotives were got ready for use; in the forests, on the mountains and in the valleys, cutting wood; building roads from ports of entry right up to the view and touch of Germans in the front-lines; burying the dead; salvaging at great risk to their own lives millions of shells and other dangerous war material, actually piling up and detonating the most deadly devices in order that French battlefields might be safe to those who walk the ways of peace.\nWho commanded these thousands of black men assembled from all parts of the United States and representing in culture all the way from absolute illiterates from under-taught Southern States to well-educated men from northern universities and colleges and even from many northern universities and colleges? By a queer twist of American reasoning on the Negro it is assumed that he is best known and best “handled” by white people from the South, who more than any other white people refuse and condemn that sort of association that would most surely acquaint the white man with the very best that is in the Negro. Therefore, when officers were to be chosen for the Negro S.O.S. men, it seems that there was a preference expressed or felt for southern white officers. Some of these were fine men, but the majority were “nigger” drivers of the most offensive type.\nThe big, outstanding fact about the command of these colored soldiers is that southern men of a narrow, harsh type dictated the policy and method and so forced it that it became unpopular for officers to be generous to these men. When it is considered that these soldiers were abjectly under such men, with no practical opportunity for redress, it is easy to imagine the extremes to which harsh treatment could be carried. So thoroughly understood was it that the Negro had to be “properly handled and kept in his place,” even in France, large use was made even of the white non-commissioned officer so that many companies and units of Negro soldiers had no higher Negro command than corporal. This harsh method showed itself in long hours, excessive tasks, little opportunity for leaves and recreation, holding of black soldiers to barracks when in the same community white soldiers had the privilege of the town, severe punishments for slight offenses, abusive language and sometimes corporal punishment. To such extremes of “handling niggers” was this carried that Negro Y.M.C.A. secretaries were refused some units on the ground, frankly stated by officers, that it would be better to have white secretaries, and in many places separate “Y” huts were demanded for white and colored soldiers so that there would be no association or fraternizing between the races.\nWorked often like slaves, twelve and fourteen hours a day, these men were well-fed, poorly clad, indifferently housed, often beaten, always “Jim-Crowed” and insulted, and yet they saw the vision—they saw a nation which splendid people threatened and torn by a ruthless enemy; they saw a democracy of splendid could not understand color prejudice. They received a thousand little kindnesses and half-known words of sympathy from the puzzled French, and French law and custom stepped in repeatedly to protect them, so that their only regret was the average white American. But they worked—how they worked! Everybody joins to testify to this: the white slave-drivers, the army officers, the French, the visitors—all say that the American Negro was the best laborer in France, of all the world’s peoples gathered there; and if American food and materials saved France in the end from utter exhaustion, it was the Negro stevedore who made that aid effective."

    "section": "The 805th",
    "text": "The 805th\nTo illustrate the kind of work which the stevedore and pioneer regiments did, we cite the history of one of the pioneer Negro regiments: Under the act of May 18, 1917, the President ordered the formation of eight colored infantry regiments. Two of these, the 805th and 806th, were organized at Camp Funston. The 805th became a Pioneer regiment and when it left camp had 3,526 men and 99 officers. It included 25 regulars from the 25th Infantry of the Regular Army, 38 mechanics from Prairie View, 20 horse-shoers from Tuskegee and 8 carpenters from Howard. The regiment was drilled and had target practice. The regiment proceeded to Camp Upton late in August, 1918, and sailed, a part from Montreal and a part from Quebec, Canada, early in September. Early in October the whole regiment arrived in the southern end of the Argonne forest. The men began their work of repairing roads as follows:\n\n\nFirst 2,000 meters of Clermont-Neuilly road from Clermont road past Apremont;\n\n\nSecond 2,000 meters of Clermont-Neuilly road, Charpentry cut-off road;\n\n\nLechères crossroad on Clermont-Neuilly road, north 2,000 meters, roads at Véry;\n\n\nClermont-Neuilly road from point 1,000 south of Neuilly, bridge to Neuilly, ammunition detour road at Neuilly, Charpentry roads;\n\n\nAuzéville railhead, Varennes railhead; railhead work at St. Juvin and Briequenay;\n\n\nAuzéville railhead, Varennes railhead, roads at Montblainville, roads at Landres-et St. George;\n\n\nRoads at Avocourt, roads at Sommarenec;\n\n\nRoads at Avocourt, roads at Fleville;\n\n\nConstruction of ammunition dump, Neuilly, and railhead construction between Neuilly and Varennes and Aprémont, railroad repair work March and St. Juvin, construction of Verdun-Etain railroad from November 11;\n\n\nRailhead details and road work Aubreville, road work Varennes and Charpentry;\n\n\nRoad and railhead work Aubreville, road work Varennes.\n\n\nThe outlying companies were continually in immediate sight of the sausage balloons and witnessed many an air battle. Raids were frequent.\nA concentration had been ordered at Varennes, November 18, and several companies had taken up their abode there or at Camp Mahaut, but to carry out the salvage program, a re-distribution over the Argonne-Meuse area had to be affected immediately.\nThe area assigned the 805th Pioneer Infantry extended from Boult-aux-Bois, almost due south to a point one kilometer west of Les Islettes; thence to Aubreville and Avocourt and Esnes; thence to Montfaucon via Bethincourt and Cuisy; thence north through Nantillois and Cunel to Bantheville; thence southwest through Romagne, Gesnes and Exermont to the main road just south of Fleville; and then north to Boult-aux-Bois through Fleville, St. Juvin, Grand Pré and Briquenay.\nThe area comprised all of the Argonne forest, from Clermont north and the Varennes-Malancourt-Montfaucon-Romagne sections. More than five hundred square miles of battlefield was included.\nA list of the articles to be salvaged would require a page. Chiefly they were Allied and enemy weapons and cannon, web and leather equipment, clothing and blankets, rolling stock, aviation electrical and engineer equipment. It was a gigantic task and did not near completion until the first week in March when more than 3,000 French carloads had been shipped.\nFor some weeks truck transportation was scarce and work was slow and consisted largely in getting material to roadsides.\nAs companies of the 805th neared the completion of their areas they were put to work at the railheads where they helped load the salvage they had gathered and that which many other organizations of the area had brought, and sent it on its way to designated depots.\nWith the slackening of the salvage work, the regiment found a few days when it was possible to devote time to drilling, athletics and study. School and agricultural books were obtained in large numbers and each company organized classes which, though not compulsory, were eagerly attended by the men.\nCurtailment of this work was necessitated by instructions from Advance Section Headquarters to assist in every way possible the restoration of French farmlands to a point where they could be cultivated.\nThis meant principally the filling of trenches across fields and upon this work the regiment entered March 15 with all its strength, except what was required for the functioning of the railheads not yet closed.\nThere was up to this time no regimental band.\nAt Camp Funston instruments had been requisitioned, but had not arrived before the regiment left. Efforts were made to enlist a colored band at Kansas City whose members wished to enter the Army as a band and be assigned to the 805th Pioneer Infantry. General Wood approved and took the matter up with the War Department. Qualified assent was obtained, but subsequent rulings prevented taking advantage of it, in view of the early date anticipated for an overseas move.\nThe rush of events when the regiment reached Europe precluded immediate attention being given the matter and, meanwhile, general orders had been issued against equipping bands not in the Regular Army.\nLeft to itself, without divisional connections, the regiment had to rely upon its own resources for diversion. The men needed music after the hard work they were doing and Colonel Humphrey sent his Adjutant to Paris to present the matter to the Y.M.C.A., Knights of Columbus and Red Cross.\nThe Red Cross was able to respond immediately and Captain Bliss returned January 1, 1919, with seven cornets, six clarinets, five saxophones, four slide trombones, four alto horns, two bass tubas, two baritones and a piccolo and, also, some “jazz band effects.”\nThe band was organized on the spot and as more instruments and music were obtained, eventually reached almost its tabular strength while it reached proficiency almost over night.\nThe following commendation of the work of the regiment was received:\n\nThe Chief Engineer desires to express his highest appreciation to you and to your regiment for the services rendered to the 1st Army in the offensive between the Meuse and the Argonne, starting September 26, and the continuation of that offensive on November 1 and concluding with the Armistice of November 11.\n \nThe success of the operations of the Army Engineer Troops toward constructing and maintaining supply lines, both roads and railway, of the Army was in no small measure made possible by the excellent work performed by your troops.\n \nIt is desired that the terms of this letter be published to all the officers and enlisted men of your command at the earliest opportunity.\n\nA soldier writes us: &gt; Our regiment is composed of colored and white officers. You will find a number of complimentary things on the regiment’s record in the Argonne in the history. We were, as you know, the fighting reserves of the Army and that we were right on this front from September to November 11. We kept the lines of communication going and, of course, we were raided and shelled by German long-range guns and subject to gas raids, too.\n&gt;  \n&gt; We are now located in the Ardennes, between the Argonne and the Meuse. This is a wild and wooly forest, I assure you. We are hoping to reach our homes in May. We have spent over seven months in this section of the battle-front and we are hoping to get started home in a few weeks after you get this letter, at least. Our regiment is the best advertised regiment in the A. E. F. and its members are from all over the United States practically.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A month or so ago we had a pay-day here and twenty thousand dollars was collected the first day and sent to relatives and banks in the United States. Every day our mail sergeant sends from one hundred to one thousand dollars per day to the United States for the men in our regiment,—savings of the small salary they receive as soldiers. As a whole they are and have learned many things by having had this great war experience."

    "text": "Negro Officers\nAll this was expected. America knows the value of Negro labor. Negroes knew that in this war as in every other war they would have the drudgery and the dirt, but with set teeth they determined that this should not be the end and limit of their service. They did not make the mistake of seeking to escape labor, for they knew that modern war is mostly ordinary toil; they even took without protest the lion’s share of the common labor, but they insisted from the first that black men must serve as soldiers and officers.\nThe white Negro-hating oligarchy was willing to have some Negro soldiers—the privilege of being shot in real war being one which they were easily persuaded to share—provided these black men did not get too much notoriety out of it. But against Negro officers they set their faces like flint.\nThe dogged insistence of the Negroes, backed eventually by the unexpected decision of Secretary Baker, encompassed the first defeat of this oligarchy and nearly one thousand colored officers were commissioned.\nImmediately a persistent campaign began:\nFirst, was the effort to get rid of Negro officers; second, the effort to discredit Negro soldiers; third, the effort to spread race prejudice in France; and fourth, the effort to keep Negroes out of the Regular Army.\nCompany 22, Sixth Battalion, 163rd Depot Brigade, Camp Dodge, Iowa. The Only Unit in the Depot Brigades Entirely Officered by Negroes. Captain C. C. Cooper, and Lieutenants T. M. Gregory, E. S. Horne, J. E. Oliver, W. B. Hall and W. C. Dickerson.\nFirst and foremost, war is war and military organization is, and must be, tyranny. This is, perhaps, the greatest and most barbarous cost of war and the most pressing reason for its abolition from civilization. As war means tyranny, the company officer is largely at the mercy of his superior officers.\nThe company officers of the colored troops were mainly colored. The field officers were with very few exceptions white. The fate of the colored officers, therefore, depended almost absolutely on those placed in higher command. Moreover, American military trials and legal procedures are antiquated and may be grossly unfair. They give the accused little chance if the accuser is determined and influential.\nThe success, then, of the Negro troops depended first of all on their field officers; given strong, devoted men of knowledge and training there was no doubt of their being able to weed out and train company officers and organize the best body of fighters on the western front. This was precisely what the Negro-haters feared. Above all, they feared Charles Young."

    "text": "Charles Young\nThere was one man in the United States Army who by every consideration of justice, efficiency and long, faithful service should have been given the command of a division of colored troops. Colonel Charles Young is a graduate of West Point and by universal admission is one of the best officers in the Army. He has served in Cuba, Haiti, the Philippines, Mexico, Africa and the West with distinction. Under him the Negro division would have been the most efficient in the Army. This rightful place was denied him. For a technical physical reason (“high blood pressure”) he was quickly retired from the Regular Army. He was not allowed a minor command or even a chance to act as instructor during the war.\nOn the contrary, the 92nd and 93rd Divisions of Negro troops were given commanding officers who with a half-dozen exceptions either distrusted Negroes or actively and persistently opposed colored officers under any circumstances. The 92nd Division particularly was made a dumping ground for poor and inexperienced field officers seeking promotion. A considerable number of these white officers from the first spent more time and ingenuity in making the lot of the Negro officer hard and the chance of the Negro soldier limited than in preparing to whip the Germans."

    "section": "Prejudice",
    "text": "Prejudice\nThese efforts fell under various heads: giving the colored officers no instruction in certain lines and then claiming that none were fitted for the work, as in artillery and engineering; persistently picking the poorest Negro candidates instead of the best for examinations and tests so as to make any failure conspicuous; using court martials and efficiency boards for trivial offenses and wholesale removals of the Negroes; subjecting Negro officers and men to persistent insult and discrimination by refusing salutes, “Jim-Crowing” places of accommodation and amusement, refusing leaves, etc.; by failing to supply the colored troops with proper equipment and decent clothing; and finally by a systematic attempt to poison the minds of the French against the Negroes and compel them to follow the dictates of American prejudice.\nThese are serious charges. The full proof of them cannot be attempted here, but a few examples will serve to indicate the nature of the proof.\nAt the colored Officers’ Training Camp no instruction was given in artillery and a dead-line was established by which no one was commissioned higher than Captain, despite several recommendations. Certain Captains’ positions, like those of the Headquarters Companies, were reserved for whites, and former non-commissioned officers were given preference with the hope that they would be more tractable than college-bred men—a hope that usually proved delusive.\nThe colored divisions were never assembled as units this side of the water. General Ballou, a timid, changeable white man, was put in command of the 92nd Division and he antagonized it from the beginning.\nGeneral Ballou’s attitude toward the men of his command, as expressed in his famous, or rather infamous, Bulletin 35, which was issued during the period of training in the United States, was manifested throughout the division during the entire time that he was in command in France. Whenever any occasion arose where trouble had occurred between white and colored soldiers, the burden of proof always rested on the colored man. All discrimination was passed unnoticed and nothing was done to protect the men who were under his command. Previous to General Bullard’s suggestion that some order be issued encouraging the troops for the good work that they had done on the Vosges and Marbache fronts, there had been nothing done to encourage the men and officers, and it seemed that instead of trying to increase the morale of the division, it was General Ballou’s intention to discourage the men as much as possible. His action in censuring officers in the presence of enlisted men was an act that tended toward breaking down the confidence that the men had in their officers, and he pursued this method on innumerable occasions. On one occasion he referred to his division, in talking to another officer, as the “rapist division”; he constantly cast aspersion on the work of the colored officer and permitted other officers to do the same in his presence, as is evidenced by the following incident which took place in the office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3, at Bourbon-les-Bains:\n\nThe staff had just been organized and several General Headquarters officers were at Headquarters advising relative to the organization of the different offices. These officers were in conversation with General Ballou, Colonel Greer, the Chief of Staff, Major Hickox, and Brigadier-General Hay. In the course of the conversation Brigadier-General Hay made the remark that “In my opinion there is no better soldier than the Negro, but God damn a ‘nigger’ officer!” This remark was made in the presence of General Ballou and was the occasion for much laughter.\n\nAfter the 92d Division moved from the Argonne forest to the Marbache Sector the 368th Infantry was held in reserve at Pompey. It was at this place that General Ballou ordered all of the enlisted men and officers of this unit to congregate and receive an address to be delivered to them by him. No one had any idea as to the nature of this address; but on the afternoon designated, the men and officers assembled on the ground, which was used as a drill-ground, and the officers were severely censured relative to the operation that had taken place in the Argonne forest. The General advised the officers, in the presence of the enlisted men, that in his opinion they were cowards; that they had failed; and that “they did not have the guts” that made brave men. This speech was made to the officers in the presence of all of the enlisted men of the 368th Infantry and was an act contrary to all traditions of the Army.\nWhen Mr. Ralph Tyler, the accredited correspondent of the War Department, reached the Headquarters of the 92d Division and was presented to General Ballou, he was received with the utmost indifference and nothing was done to enable him to reach the units at the front in order to gain the information which he desired. After Mr. Tyler was presented to General Ballou, the General walked out of the office of the Chief of Staff with Mr. Tyler, came into the office of the Adjutant, where all of the enlisted men worked, and stood directly in front of the desk of the colored officer, who was seated in the office of the Adjutant, and in a loud voice said to Mr. Tyler: “I regard the colored officer as a distinct failure. He is cowardly and has none of the traits which go to make a successful officer.” This expression was made in the presence of all of the enlisted personnel and in a tone of voice loud enough for all of them to hear.\nGeneral Ballou’s Chief of Staff was a white Georgian and from first to last his malign influence was felt and he openly sought political influence to antagonize his own troops.\nGeneral —— Commanding Officer of the —— (92d Division), said to Major Patterson, (color), Division Judge-Advocate, that there was a concerted action on the part of the white officers throughout France to discredit the work of the colored troops in France and that everything was being done to advertise those things that would reflect discredit upon the men and officers and to withhold anything that would bring to these men praise or commendation.\nOn the afternoon of November 8, the Distinguished Service Cross was awarded to Lieutenant Campbell and Private Bernard Lewis, 368th Infantry, the presentation of which was made with the prescribed ceremonies, taking place on a large field just outside of Villers-en-Haye and making a very impressive sight. The following morning a private from the 804th Pioneer Infantry was executed at Belleville, for rape. The official photographer attached to the 92d Division arose at 5 A.M. on the morning of the execution, which took place at 6 A.M., and made a moving-picture film of the hanging of this private. Although the presentation of the Distinguished Service Crosses occurred at 3 P. M. on the previous day, the official photographer did not see fit to make a picture of this and when asked if he had made a picture of the presentation, he replied that he had forgotten about it.\nThe campaign against Negro officers began in the cantonments. At Camp Dix every effort was made to keep competent colored artillery officers from being trained. Most of the Colonels began a campaign for wholesale removals of Negro officers from the moment of embarkation.\nAt first an attempt was made to have General Headquarters in France assent to the blanket proposition that white and Negro officers would not get on in the same organization; this was unsuccessful and was followed by the charge that Negroes were incompetent as officers. This charge was made wholesale and before the colored officers had had a chance to prove themselves, “Efficiency Boards” immediately began wholesale removals and as such boards could act on the mere opinion of field officers the colored company officers began to be removed wholesale and to be replaced by whites.\nThe court martials of Negro officers were often outrageous in their contradiction of common sense and military law. The experience of one Captain will illustrate. He was a college man, with militia training, who secured a captaincy at Des Moines—a very difficult accomplishment—and was from the first regarded as an efficient officer by his fellows; when he reached Europe, however, the Major of his battalion was from Georgia, and this Captain was too independent to suit him. The Major suddenly ordered the Captain under close arrest and after long delay preferred twenty-three charges against him. These he afterward reduced to seven, continuing meantime to heap restrictions and insults on the accused, but untried, officer. Instead of breaking arrest or resenting his treatment the Captain kept cool, hired a good colored lawyer in his division and put up so strong a fight that the court martial acquitted him and restored him to his command, and sent the Major to the stevedores.\nNot every officer was able to preserve his calm and poise.\nOne colored officer turned and cursed his unfair superiors and the court martial, and revealed an astonishing story of the way in which he had been hounded.\nA Lieutenant of a Machine Gun Battalion was employed at Intelligence and Personnel work. He was dismissed and reinstated three times because the white officers who succeeded him could not do the work. Finally he was under arrest for one and one-half months and was dismissed from service, but General Headquarters investigated the case and restored him to his rank.\nMost of the Negro officers had no chance to fight. Some were naturally incompetent and deserved demotion or removal, but these men were not objects of attack as often as the more competent and independent men.\nHere, however, as so often afterward, the French stepped in, quite unconsciously, and upset careful plans. While the American officers were convinced of the Negro officers’ incompetency and were besieging General Headquarters to remove them en masse, the French instructors at the Gondrecourt Training School, where Captains and selected Lieutenants were sent for training, reported that the Negroes were among the best Americans sent there.\nMoreover, the 93d Division, which had never been assembled or even completed as a unit and stood unrecognized and unattached, was suddenly called in the desperate French need, to be brigaded with French soldiers. The Americans were thoroughly scared. Negroes and Negro officers were about to be introduced to French democracy without the watchful eye of American color hatred to guard them. Something must be done.\nAs the Negro troops began moving toward the Vosges sector of the battlefield, August 6, 1918, active anti-Negro propaganda became evident. From the General Headquarters of the American Army at Chaumont the French Military Mission suddenly sent out, not simply to the French Army, but to all the Prefects and Sous-Prefects of France (corresponding to our governors and mayors), a data setting forth at length the American attitude toward Negroes; warning against social recognition; stating that Negroes were prone to deeds of violence and were threatening America with degeneration, etc. The white troops backed this propaganda by warnings and tales wherever they preceded the blacks.\nThis misguided effort was lost on the French. In some cases peasants and villagers were scared at the approach of Negro troops, but this was but temporary and the colored troops everywhere they went soon became easily the best liked of all foreign soldiers. They were received in the best homes, and where they could speak French or their hosts understood English, there poured forth their story of injustice and wrong into deeply sympathetic ears. The impudent swagger of many white troops, with their openly expressed contempt for “Frogs” and their evident failure to understand the first principles of democracy in the most democratic of lands, finished the work thus begun.\nNo sounding words of President Wilson can offset in the minds of thousands of Frenchmen the impression of disloyalty and coarseness which the attempt to force color prejudice made on a people who just owed their salvation to black West Africa!\nLittle was published or openly said, but when the circular on American Negro prejudice was brought to the attention of the French ministry, it was quietly collected and burned. And in a thousand delicate ways the French expressed their silent disapprobation. For instance, in a provincial town a colored officer entered a full dining-room; the smiling landlady hastened to seat him (how natural!) at a table with white American officers, who immediately began to show their displeasure. A French officer at a neighboring table with French officers quietly glanced at the astonished landlady. Not a word was said, no one in the dining-room took any apparent notice, but the black officer was soon seated with the courteous Frenchmen.\nOn the Negroes this double experience of deliberate and devilish persecution from their own countrymen, coupled with a taste of real democracy and world-old culture, was revolutionizing. They began to hate prejudice and discrimination as they had never hated it before. They began to realize its eternal meaning and complications. Far from filling them with a desire to escape from their race and country, they were filled with a bitter, dogged determination never to give up the fight for Negro equality in America. If American color prejudice counted on this war experience to break the spirit of the young Negro, it counted without its host. A new, radical Negro spirit has been born in France, which leaves us older radicals far behind. Thousands of young black men have offered their lives for the Lilies of France and they return ready to offer them again for the Sun-flowers of Afro-America."

It consisted of Negro National Guard troops almost exclusively offered by Negroes—the 8th Illinois, the 15th New York, and units from the District of Columbia, Maryland, Ohio, Tennessee and Massachusetts. The division was thus incomplete and never really functioned as a division. For a time it was hoped that Colonel Young might be given his chance here, but nothing came of this. Early in April when the need of the French for re-enforcements was sorest, these black troops were hurriedly transported to France and were soon brigaded with the French armies."

    "text": "The 369th\nThis regiment was originally authorized by Governor Sulzer, but its formation was long prevented. Finally it was organized with but one Negro officer. Eventually the regiment sailed with colored and white officers, landing in France, January 1, 1918, and went into the second battle of the Marne in July, east of Verdun, near Ville-sur-Turbe. It was thus the first American Negro unit in battle and one of the first American units. Colored officers took part in this battle and some were cited for bravery. Nevertheless the white Colonel, Hayward, after the battle secured the transfer of every single colored officer, except the bandmaster and chaplain.\nThe regiment was in a state of irritation many times, but it was restrained by the influence of the non-commissioned officers—very strong in this case because the regiment was all from New York and mainly from Harlem—and especially because being brigaded with the French they were from the first treated on such terms of equality and brotherhood that they were eager to fight. There were charges that Colonel Hayward and his white officers needlessly sacrificed the lives of these men. This, of course, is hard to prove; but certainly the casualties in this regiment were heavy and in the great attack in the Champagne, in September and October, two hundred were killed and eight hundred were wounded and gassed. The regiment went into battle with the French on the left and the Moroccans on the right and got into its own barrage by advancing faster than the other units. It was in line seven and one-half days, when three to four days is usually the limit.\nSergeant E. W.

    "text": "The 371st and 372nd\nThe 371st Regiment was drafted from South Carolina and had southern white officers from the first, many of whom were arrogant and overbearing. The regiment mobilized at Camp Jackson, October 5-17, and embarked for France, April 9, from Newport News, Va. It was trained at Rembercourt-aux-Ports (Meuse) and left for the region near Bar-le-Duc, June 5. The troops arrived in the Argonne June 22. They were brigaded with the 157th French Division, 13th Army Corps, and remained in the battle-line, front and reserve, until the Armistice was signed.\nThere are few data at present available for the history of this regiment because there were no colored officers to preserve it. It is rumored, however, that after the first battle the number of casualties among the meanest of their officers led to some mutual understandings. The regiment received a number of citations for bravery.\nAs this regiment was brigaded usually with the 372nd, a part of its history follows:\nThe official records show that the 372nd Infantry was organized at Camp Stuart, January 1, 1918, Colonel Glendie B. Young, Infantry, U.S.N.G., commanding, and included the following National Guard units: First Separate Battalion, District of Columbia, Infantry; Ninth Battalion of Ohio, Infantry; Company L, Sixth Massachusetts, Infantry; and one company each from Maryland, Tennessee and Connecticut. To these were added later 250 men from Camp Custer; excepting the Staff, Machine Gun, Headquarters and Supply Companies, the regiment was officered by colored men.\nThe regiment was brigaded with the 371st into the 186th Infantry Brigade, a unit of the Provisional 93rd Division. It was understood that the 93rd Division, which was to be composed of all Negro troops, would be fully organized in France; but when the 372nd arrived at St. Nazaire, April 14, 1918, the organization was placed under command of the French. Four weeks later the brigade was dissolved and the 93rd Division ceased to be mentioned. Its four regiments were all subject to orders of the French G.Q., General Petain, commanding.\nThe regiment spent five weeks in training and re-organization at Conde-en-Barrois (Meuse), as a unit of the 13th French Army Corps. The men were trained in French methods by French officers and non-commissioned officers with French ordnance equipment. They developed so rapidly that a French Major exclaimed enthusiastically on the street: “These men are intelligent and alert. Their regiment will have a glorious career.” Thus, from the beginning the worth of our troops was recognized by a veteran of the French Army.\nTo complete its training under actual war conditions, the regiment was sent to a “quiet sector”—sub-sector, Argonne West, on June 8, where it spent twenty days learning the organization of defensive positions and how to hold these positions under shell fire from the enemy. During this time it was a part of the 63rd French Division and during the last ten days it was a part of the 35th French Division. On July 2, the 372nd Infantry became permanently identified with the 157th French Division, commanded by General Goybet. The division consisted of two colored American regiments and one French regiment of infantry. The artillery units, engineers, sanitary train, etc., were all French. On his first inspection tour, at Vanquois, General Goybet asked one of our men if he thought the Germans could pass if they started over. The little brown private replied: “Not if the boches can’t do a good job in killing all of us.” That pleased the new General very much and clinched his confidence in the black troops.\nOn July 13 the regiment retired to a reserve position near the village of Locheres (Meuse), for temporary rest and to help sustain the coming blow. The next day Colonel Young was relieved of command by Colonel Herschel Tupes, a regular army officer. In the afternoon the regiment was assembled and prepared for action, but it later was found that it would not be needed. The attack of the Germans was launched near Rheims on the night of July 14 and the next evening the world read of the decisive defeat of the Germans by General Gourand’s army.\nThe following Sunday found the regiment billeted in the town of Sivry-la-Perche, not very far from Verdun. After a band concert in the afternoon Colonel Tupes introduced himself to his command. In the course of his remarks, he said that he had always commanded regulars, but he had little doubt that the 372nd Infantry could become as good as any regiment in France.\nOn July 26 the regiment occupied sub-sector 304. The occupation of this sub-sector was marked by hard work and discontentment. The whole position had to be re-organized, and in doing this the men maintained their previous reputation for good work. The total stay in the sector was seven weeks. The regiment took part in two raids and several individuals distinguished themselves: one man received a Croix de Guerre because he held his trench mortar between his legs to continue firing when the base had been damaged by a shell; another carried a wounded French comrade from “No Man’s Land” under heavy fire, and was also decorated. Several days after a raid, the Germans were retaliating by shelling the demolished village of Montzeville, situated in the valley below the Post-of-Command and occupied by some of the reserves; Private Rufus Pinckney rushed through the heavy fire and rescued a wounded French soldier.\nOn another occasion, Private Kenneth Lewis of the Medical Detachment, later killed at his post, displayed such fine qualities of coolness and disdain for danger by sticking to duty until the end that two post-mortem decorations: the Croix de Guerre with Palm and Medaille Militaire were awarded. The latter is a very distinguished recognition in the French Army.\nSo well had the regiment worked in the Argonne that it was sent to relieve the 123rd French Infantry Regiment in the sub-sector Vanquois, on July 28. An attack by the Germans in the valley of the Aire, of which Vanquois was a key, was expected at any moment. New defenses were to be constructed and old ones strengthened. The men applied themselves with a courageous devotion, night and day, totheir tasks and after two weeks of watchful working under fire, Vanquois became a formidable defensive system.\nBesides the gallantry of Private Pinckney, Montzeville must be remembered in connection with the removal of colored officers from the regiment. It was there that a board of officers (all white) requested by Colonel Young and appointed by Colonel Tupes, sat on the cases of twenty-one colored officers charged with inefficiency. Only one out of that number was acquitted: he was later killed in action. The charges of inefficiency were based on physical disability, insufficient training, unsuitability. The other colored officers who had been removed were either transferred to other units or sent to re-classification depots.\nThe Colonel told the Commanding General through an interpreter: “The colored officers in this regiment know as much about their duties as a child.” The General was surprised and whispered to another French officer that the Colonel himself was not so brilliant and that he believed it was prejudice that caused the Colonel to make such a change. A few moments after, the Colonel told the General that he had requested that no more colored officers be sent to the regiment. In reply to this the General explained how unwise it was because, the colored officers had been trained along with their men at a great expenditure of time and money by the American and French governments; and, also, he doubted if well-qualified white officers could be spared him from other American units. The General insisted that the time was at hand for the great autumn drive and that it would be a hindrance because he feared the men would not be pleased with the change. The Colonel heeded not his General and forwarded two requests for an anti-colored-officer regiment. He went so far as to tell the Lieutenant-Colonel that he believed the regiment should have white men for non-commissioned officers. Of course, the men would not have stood for this at any price. The Colonel often would tell the Adjutant to never trust a “damned black clerk” and that he considered “one white man worth a million Negroes.”\nAbout September 8 the regiment was relieved by the 129th United States Infantry and was sent to the rear for a period of rest. Twenty-four hours after arrival in the rest area, orders were received to proceed farther. The nightly marches began. The regiment marched from place to place in the Aube, the Marne and the Haute Marne until it went into the great Champagne battle on September 27.\nFor nine days it helped push the Hun toward the Belgian frontier. Those days were hard, but these men did their duty and came out with glory. Fortunately, all the colored officers had not left the regiment and it was they and the brave sergeants who led the men to victory and fame. The new white officers had just arrived, some of them the night before the regiment went into battle, several of whom had never been under fire in any capacity, having just come out of the training school at Langres. Nevertheless, the regiment was cited by the French and the regimental colors were decorated by Vice-Admiral Moreau at Brest, January 24, 1919.\nAfter the relief on the battlefield, the regiment reached Somme Bionne (Marne) October 8. Congratulations came in from everywhere except American Headquarters. After a brief rest of three days the regiment was sent to a quiet sector in the Vosges, on the frontier of Alsace. The Colonel finally disposed of the remaining colored officers, except the two dentists and the two chaplains. All the officers were instructed to carry their arms at all times and virtually to shoot any soldier on the least provocation.\nAs a consequence, a corporal of Company L was shot and killed by First Lieutenant James B. Coggins, from North Carolina, for a reason that no one has ever been able to explain. The signing of the Armistice and the cessation of hostilities, perhaps, prevented a general, armed opposition to a system of prejudice encouraged by the Commanding Officer of the Regiment.\nDespite the prejudice of officers toward the men, the regiment marched from Ban-de-Laveline to Granges of Vologne, a distance of forty-five kilometers, in one day and maintained such remarkable discipline that the officers themselves were compelled to accord them praise.\nWhile stationed at Granges, individuals in the regiment were decorated on December 17 for various deeds of gallantry in the Champagne battle. General Goybet presented four military medals and seventy-two Croix de Guerre to enlisted men. Colonel Tupes presented four Distinguished Service Crosses to enlisted men. At the time, the regiment had just been returned to the American command, the following order was read:\n\n157th Division\nHqrs. December 15th, 1918.\nStaff.\n \nGeneral Order No. 246.\n \nOn the date of the 12th of December, 1918, the 371st and the 372nd R.I., U.S. have been returned to the disposal of the American Command. It is not without profound emotion that I come in the name of the 157th (French) Division and in my personal name, to say good-bye to our valiant comrades of combat. For seven months we have lived as brothers of arms, sharing the same works, the same hardships, the same dangers; side by side we have taken part in the great battle of the Champagne, that a wonderful victory has ended.\n \nThe 157th (French) Division will never forget the wonderful impetus irresistible, the rush heroic of the colored American regiments on the “Observatories Crest” and in the Plain of Menthois. The most formidable defense, the nests of machine guns, the best organized positions, the artillery barrages most crushing, could not stop them. These best regiments have gone through all with disdaining of death and thanks to their courage devotedness, the “Red Hand” Division has during nine hard days of battle been ahead in the victorious advance of the Fourth (French) Army.\n \nOfficers and non-commissioned officers and privates of the 371st and 372nd Regiments Infantry, U.S., I respectfully salute your glorious dead and I bow down before your standards, which by the side of the 333rd R.I., led us to victory.\n \nDear Friends from America, when you have crossed back over the ocean, don’t forget the “Red Hand” Division. Our fraternity of arms has been soaked in the blood of the brave. Those bonds will be indistructible.\n \nKeep a faithful remembrance to your General, so proud to have commanded you, and remember that his thankful affection is gained to you forever.\n \n(Signed) General Goybet, Commanding the 157th. (French) Division, Infantry.\n\nColonel Tupes, in addressing the regiment, congratulated them on the achievements and expressed his satisfaction with their conduct. He asked the men to take a just pride in their accomplishments and their spirit of loyalty.\nCan this be surpassed for eccentricity?\nThe seven weeks at Granges were pleasant and profitable socially. Lectures were given to the men by French officers, outdoor recreation was provided and the civilian population opened their hearts and their homes to the Negro heroes. Like previous attempts, the efforts of the white officers to prevent the mingling of Negroes with the French girls of the village were futile. Every man was taken on his merits. The mayor of Granges gave the regiment an enthusiastic farewell.\nOn January 1, 1919, the regiment entrained for Le Mans (Sarthe). After completing with the red-tape preparatory to embarkation and the delousing process it went to Brest, arriving there January 13, 1919."

    "text": "The 370th\nUp to this point the anti-Negro propaganda is clear and fairly consistent and unopposed. General Headquarters had not only witnessed instructions in Negro prejudice to the French, but had, also, consented to wholesale removals of officers among the engineers and infantry, on the main ground of color. Even the French, in at least one case, had been persuaded that Negro officers were the cause of certain inefficiencies in Negro units.\nUndoubtedly the cruel losses of the 369th Regiment were due in part to the assumption of the French at first that the American Negroes were like the Senegalese; these half-civilized troops could not in time given them be trained in modern machine warfare, and they were rushed at the enemy almost with naked hands. The resulting slaughter was horrible. Our troops tell of great black fields of stark and crimson dead after some of these superhuman onrushes.\nIt was this kind of fighting that the French expected of the black Americans at first and some white American officers did not greatly care so long as white men got the glory. The French easily misunderstood the situation at first and assumed that the Negro officers were to blame, especially as this was continually suggested to them by the Americans.\nIt was another story, however, when the 370th Regiment came. This was the famous 8th Illinois, and it had a full quota of Negro officers, from Colonel down. It had seen service on the Mexican Border; it went to Houston, Tex., after the Thirteen had died for Freedom; and it was treated with wholesome respect. It was sent to Newport News, Va., for embarkation; one Colonel Denison refused to embark his troops and marched them back to camp because he learned they were to be “Jim-Crowed” on the way over.\nThe Colonel and Officers of the 370th U. S. I. with Captain Boutte and Dr. Du Bois in camp at Le Mans, France.\nThe regiment arrived at Brest, April 22, and was assigned to the 72nd French Division, remaining near Belfort until June 17. Then it went with the 34th French Division into the front-line, at St. Mihiel, for a month and later with the 36th French Division into the Argonne, where they fought. They were given a short period of rest and then they went into the front-line, at Soissons, with the 59th French Division. In September and October they were fighting again.\nOn September 15, in the Vauxaillon area, they captured Mt. Des singes and the adjacent woods after severe fighting. They held a sector alone afterward on the Canal L’Oise et Aisne and when attacked, repulsed the Germans and moved forward, gaining the praise of the French General. On October 24, the regiment went into the front-line again, near Grand Lup, and performed excellent service; the Armistice found part of the regiment across the Belgian frontier.\nThe general conduct of the regiment was excellent. No case of rape was reported and only one murder. The regiment received sixteen Distinguished Service Crosses and seventy-five Croix de Guerre, beside company citations.\nWhen at first the regiment did not adopt the tactics of “shock” troops, the white Americans again took their cue and inspired a speech from the French General, which the colored men could not understand. It was not long, however, before the French General publicly apologized for his first and hasty criticism and afterward he repeatedly commended both officers and men for their bravery, intelligence and daring. This regiment received more citations than any other American regiment for bravery on the field of battle. There was, of course, the fly in the ointment—the effort to substitute white officers was strong and continuous, notwithstanding the fact that many of the black officers of this regiment were among the most efficient in the American Army.\nGeneral Headquarters by this time had begun to change its attitude and curb the Bourbons. It announced that it was not the policy of the American Army to make wholesale removals simply on account of color and it allowed the citations for bravery of Negro troops to be approved.\nNevertheless, the pressure continued. First the colored Colonel, the ranking Negro officer in France, was sent home. The reason for this is not clear. At any rate Colonel Dennison was replaced by a white Colonel, who afterward accepted a Croix de Guerre for an exploit which the Negro officers to a man declare was actually performed by a Negro officer while he was sitting snugly in his tent. The men of the regiment openly jeered him, crying out: “Blue Eyes ain’t our Colonel; Duncan’s our Colonel!” referring to the colored Lieutenant-Colonel. But the white Colonel was diplomatic; he let the colored officers run the regiment, posed as the “Moses” of the colored race (to the open amusement of the Negroes) and quietly tried to induct white officers. “I cannot understand why they sent this white Lieutenant,” he said plaintively to a colored officer. The officer at that moment had in his pocket a copy of the Colonel’s telegram asking General Headquarters for white officers. But the Armistice came before the Colonel succeeded in getting but two white officers,—his brother as Major (without a battalion) and one Lieutenant.\nThe organization that ranked all America in distinction remained, therefore, a Negro organization, for the white Colonel was only “commanding” and Dennison was still titular head."

    "text": "The 92nd Division\nSo much for the 93rd Division. Its troops fought magnificently in the Champagne, the Argonne and elsewhere and were given unstinted praise by the French and even commendation by the Americans. They fought well, too, despite the color of their officers—371st Regiment under white, the 369th and 372nd Regiments under white and colored, and the 370th Regiment under colored were equally brave, except that the 370th Regiment made the most conspicuous record.\nOne might conclude under ordinary circumstances that it was a matter of efficiency in officers and not of race, but, unfortunately, the efficient colored officer had almost no chance even to try except in the 370th Regiment and in the Champagne battle with the 372nd Regiment. With a fair chance there is no doubt that he could have led every one of these regiments just as well as the white officers. It must, too, be remembered that all the non-commissioned officers in all these regiments were Negroes.\nThe storm center of the Negro troops was the 92nd Division. The brigading of the 93rd Division with the French made wholesale attack and depreciation difficult, since it was continually annulled by the generous appreciation of the French. The 92nd Division, however, was planned as a complete Negro division, manned by Negro company officers. Everything depended, then, on the General and field officers as to how fair this experiment should be.\nFrom the very first there was open and covert opposition and trouble. Instead of putting Colonel Young at the head, the white General Ballou, was chosen and surrounded by southern white officers who despised “nigger” officers.\nGeneral Ballou himself was well-meaning, but weak, vacillating, without great ability and afraid of southern criticism. He was morbidly impressed by the horror of this “experiment” and proceeded from the first to kill the morale of his troops by orders and speeches. He sought to make his Negro officers feel personal responsibility for the Houston outbreak; he tried to accuse them indirectly of German propaganda; he virtually ordered them to submit to certain personal humiliations and discriminations without protest. Thus, before the 92nd Division was fully formed, General Ballou had spread hatred and distrust among his officers and men. “That old Ballou stuff!” became a by-word in the division for anti-Negro propaganda. Ballou was finally dismissed from his command for “tactical inefficiency.”\nThe main difficulty, however, lay in a curious misapprehension in white men of the meaning and method of race contact in America. They sought desperately to reproduce in the Negro division and in France the racial restrictions of America, on the theory that any new freedom would “spoil” the blacks. But they did not understand the fact that men of the types who became Negro officers protect themselves from continuous insult and discrimination by making and moving in a world of their own; they associate socially where they are more than welcome; they live for the most part beside neighbors who like them; they attend schools where they are not insulted; and they work where their work is appreciated. Of course, every once in a while they have to unite to resent encroachments upon their world—new discriminations in law and custom; but this is occasional and not continuous.\nThe world which General Ballou and his field officers tried to re-create for Negro officers was a world of continuous daily insult and discrimination to an extent that none had ever experienced, and they did this in a country where the discrimination was artificial and entirely unnecessary, arousing the liveliest astonishment and mystification.\nFor instance, when the Headquarters Company of the 92nd Division sailed for Brest, elaborate quarters in the best hotel were reserved for white officers, and unfinished barracks, without beds and in the cold and mud, were assigned Negro officers. The colored officers went to their quarters and then returned to the city. They found that the white Americans, unable to make themselves understood in French, had not been given their reservation, but had gone to another and poorer hotel. The black officers immediately explained and took the fine reservations.\nAs no Negroes had been trained in artillery, it was claimed immediately that none were competent. Nevertheless, some were finally found to qualify. Then it was claimed that technically trained privates were impossible to find. There were plenty to be had if they could be gathered from the various camps. Permission to do this was long refused, but after endless other delays and troubles, the Field Artillery finally came into being with a few colored officers. Before the artillery was ready, the division mobilized at Camp Upton, between May 28 and June 4, and was embarked by the tenth of June for France.\nThe entire 92nd Division arrived at Brest by June 20. A week later the whole division went to Bourbonne-les-Bains, where it stayed in training until August 6. Here a determined effort at wholesale replacement of the colored officers took place Fifty white Lieutenants were sent to the camp to replace Negro officers. “Efficiency” boards began to weed out colored men.\nWithout doubt there was among colored as among white American officers much inefficiency, due to lack of adaptability, training and the hurry of preparation. But in the case of the Negro officers repeatedly the race question came to the fore and permission was asked to remove them because they were colored, while the inefficiency charge was a wholesale one against their “race and nature.”\nGeneral Headquarters by this time, however, had settled down to a policy of requiring individual, rather than wholesale, accusation, and while this made a difference, yet in the army no officer can hold his position long if his superiors for any reason wish to get rid of him. While, then, many of the waiting white Lieutenants went away, the colored officers began to be systematically reduced in number.\nOn August 6 the division entered the front-line trenches in the Vosges sector and stayed here until September 20. It was a quiet sector, with only an occasional German raid to repel. About September 20, the division began to move to the Argonne, where the great American drive to cut off the Germans was to take place. The colored troops were not to enter the front-lines, as General Pershing himself afterward said, as they were entirely unequipped for front-line service. Nevertheless, the 368th Regiment, which arrived in the Argonne September 24, was suddenly sent into battle on the front-line on the morning of September 26. As this is a typical instance of the difficulties of Negro officers and troops, it deserves recital in detail.\nIt is the story of the failure of white field officers to do their duty and the partially successful and long-continued effort of company officers and men to do their duty despite this. That there was inexperience and incompetency among the colored officers is probable, but it was not confined to them; in their case the greater responsibility lay elsewhere, for it was the plain duty of the field officers: First, to see that their men were equipped for battle; second, to have the plans clearly explained, at least, step by step, to the company officers; third, to maintain liaison between battalions and between the regiment and the French and other American units.\nHere follows the story as it was told to me point by point by those who were actually on the spot. They were earnest, able men, mostly Lieutenants and Captains, and one could not doubt, there in the dim, smoke-filled tents about Le Mans, their absolute conscientiousness and frankness."

    "text": "The 368th\nThe 368th Regiment went into the Argonne September 24 and was put into the drive on the morning of September 26. Its duty was “combat liaison,” with the French 37th Division and the 77th (white) Division of Americans. The regiment as a whole was not equipped for battle in the front-line. It had no artillery support until the sixth day of the battle; it had no grenades, no trench fires, trombones, or signal flares, no airplane panels for signaling and no shears for German wire. The wire-cutting shears given them were absolutely useless with the heavy German barbed wire and they were able to borrow only sixteen large shears, which had to serve the whole attacking battalion.1 Finally, they had no maps and were at no time given definite objectives.\nThe Second Battalion of the 368th Regiment entered battle on the morning of September 26, with Major Elser in command; all the company officers were colored; Company F went “over the top” at 5:30 A.M.; Company H, with which the Major was, went “over” at 12:30 noon; advancing four kilometers further, the battalion met the enemy’s fire; the Machine Gun Company silenced the fire; Major Elser, who had halted in the woods to collect souvenirs from dead German bodies, immediately with drew part of the battalion to the rear in single file about dark without notifying the rest of the battalion. Captain Dabney and Lieutenant Powell of the Machine Gun Company led the rest of the men out in order about 10:00 P.M. When the broadside opened on September 26, Major Elser stood wringing his hands and crying: “What shall I do! What shall I do!” At night he deplored the occurrence, said it was all his fault, and the next morning Major Elser commended the Machine Gun Company for extricating the deserted part of the battalion. Moving forward again at 11 A. M., two companies went “over the top” at 4 P.M. without liaison. With the rest of the battalion again, these companies went forward one and one-half kilometers. Major Elser stayed back with the Post-of-Command. Enemy fire and darkness again stopped the advancing companies and Captain Jones fell back 500 metres and sent a message about 6 A.M. on the morning of September 28 to the Major asking for re-enforcements. Captain Jones stayed under snipers’ fire until about 3 P.M. and when no answer to his request came from the Major, he went “over the top” again and retraced the same 500 metres. Heavy machine gun and rifle fire again greeted him. He took refuge in nearby trenches, but his men began to drift away in confusion. All this time the Major was in the rear. On September 28, however, Major Elser was relieved of the command of the battalion and entered the hospital for “psycho-neurosis,” or “shell-shock,”—a phrase which often covers a multitude of sins. Later he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and transferred to a Labor Battalion.\nMeantime, on September 27, at 4:30 P.M., the Third Battalion of the 368th Infantry moved forward. It was commanded by Major B.F. Norris, a white New York lawyer, a graduate of Plattsburg, and until this battle a Headquarters Captain with no experience on the line. Three companies of the battalion advanced two and one-half kilometers and about 6:30 P.M. were fired on by enemy machine guns. The Major, who was in support with one company and a platoon of machine guns, ordered the machine guns to trenches seventy-five yards in the rear. The Major’s orders were confusing and the company as well as the platoon retreated to the trenches, leaving the firing-line unsupported. Subjected to heavy artillery, grenade, machine gun and rifle fire during the whole night of September 27 and being without artillery support or grenades, the firing line broke and the men took refuge in the trench with the Major, where all spent a terrible night under rain and bombardment. Next morning, September 28, at 7:30 A.M., the firing-line was restored and an advance ordered. The men led by their colored officers responded. They swept forward two and one-half kilometers and advanced beyond both French and Americans on the left and right. Their field officers failed to keep liaison with the French and American white units and even lost track of their own Second Battalion, which was dribbling away in one of the front trenches. The advancing firing-line of the Third Battalion met a withering fire of trench mortars, seventy-sevens, machine guns, etc. It still had no artillery support and being too far in advance received the German fire front, flank and rear and this they endured five hours. The line broke at 12:30 and the men retreated to the support trench, where the Major was. He reprimanded the colored officers severely. They reported the intense artillery fire and their lack of equipment, their ignorance of objectives and their lack of maps for which they had asked. They were ordered to re-form and take up positions, which they did. Many contradictory orders passed to the Company Commanders during the day: to advance, to halt, to hold, to withdraw, to leave woods as quickly as possible. Finally, at 6:30 P.M., they were definitely ordered to advance. They advanced three kilometres and met exactly the same conditions as before,—heavy artillery fire on all sides. The Company Commanders were unable to hold all their men and the Colonel ordered the Major to withdraw his battalion from the line. Utter confusion resulted,—there were many casualties and many were gassed. Major Norris withdrew, leaving a platoon under Lieutenant Dent on the line ignorant of the command to withdraw. They escaped finally unaided during the night.\nThe Chief of Staff said in his letter to Senator McKellar: “One of our majors commanding a battalion said: ‘The men are rank cowards, there is no other words for it.’”\nA colored officer writes:\n\nI was the only colored person present when this was uttered: It was on the 27th of last September in the second line trenches of Vienne Le Chateau in our attack in the Argonne and was uttered by Major B. F. Norris, commanding the 3rd Battalion. Major Norris, himself, was probably the biggest coward because he left his Battalion out in the front lines and came back to the Colonel’s dugout a nervous wreck. I was there in a bunk alongside of the wall and this major came and laid down beside me and he moaned and groaned so terribly all night that I couldn’t hardly close my eyes—he jumped and twisted worse than anything I have ever seen in my life. He was a rank coward himself and left his unit on some trifling pretext and remained back all night.\n\nFrom September 26-29 the First Battalion of the 368th Infantry, under Major J. N. Merrill, was in the front-line French trenches. On the night of September 28 it prepared to advance, but after being kept standing under shell-fire for two hours it was ordered back to the trenches. A patrol was sent out to locate the Third Battalion, but being refused maps by the Colonel it was a long time on the quest and before it returned the First Battalion was ordered to advance, on the morning of September 29. By 1:00 P. M. they had advanced one mile when they were halted to find Major Merrill. Finally Major Merrill was located after two hours’ search. A French Lieutenant guided them to positions in an old German trench. The Major ordered them forward 600 yards to other deserted German trenches. Terrific shell- fire met them here, and there were many casualties. They stayed in the trench during the night of September 29 and at noon on September 30 were ordered to advance. They advanced three kilometres through the woods, through shell and machine gun fire and artillery barrage. They dug in and stayed all night under fire. On October 1 the French Artillery came up and put over a barrage. Unfortunately, it fell short and the battalion was caught between the German and French barrages and compelled hastily to withdraw.\nThe regiment was soon after relieved by a French unit and taken by train to the Marbache sector. Major Elser, of the Second Battalion, made no charges against his colored officers and verbally assumed responsibility for the failure of his battalion. There was a time strong talk of a court martial for him. Major Merrill made no charges; but Major Norris on account of the two breaks in the line of the Third Battalion on September 28 ordered five of his colored line officers court-martialed for cowardice and abandonment of positions— a Captain, two First Lieutenants, and a Second Lieutenant were accused. Only one case,—that of the Second Lieutenant, had been decided at this writing. He was found guilty by the court-martial, but on review of his case by General Headquarters he was acquitted and restored to his command.\nColonel Greer in the letter to Senator McKellar on December 6, writes as follows:\n\nFrom there we went to the Argonne and in the offensive starting there on September 26, had one regiment in the line, attached to the 38th French Corps. They failed there in all their missions, laid down and sneaked to the rear, until they were withdrawn.\n\nThis is what Colonel Durand, the French General who was in command in this action, said in a French General Order: “L’Honneur de la prise de Binarville doit revenir au 368th R.I.U.S.”\nAnd this is what Colonel Greer himself issued in General Order No. 38, Headquarters 92nd Division, the same day he wrote his infamous letter to this senator:\n\nThe Division Commander desires to commend in order the meritorious conduct of Private Charles E. Boykin, Company C, 926th Field Signal Battalion. On the afternoon of September 26, 1918, while the 368th Infantry was in action in the Argonne forest the Regimental Commander moved forward to establish a P.C. and came upon a number of Germans who fled to the woods which were FOUND TO BE ALIVE WITH MACHINE GUNS. The Commanding Officer ordered the woods searched to the top of the hill, the officer in charge of the scouting (2nd Lieutenant C. W. Carpenter) called for volunteers and Private Boykin, a telephone linesman, offered his services and set out with the rest of the detail. While trying to flank an enemy machine gun another opened fire killing him instantly.\n\nThis effort of the 368th Regiment was seized upon by Army gossip and widely heralded as a “failure” of Negro troops, and particularly of Negro officers. Yet the same sort of troops and many Negro officers in the Champagne and afterward in the Argonne under French leadership covered themselves with glory. The real failure in the initial Argonne drive was in American field strategy which was totally unequal to German methods and had to learn by bitter experience. It is worse than unfair to write off the first experience to the discredit of Negro troops and company officers who did all that was humanly possible under the circumstances."

    "text": "Other Units\nThe 365th, 366th and 367th Regiments did not enter the battle-line at all in the Argonne. The whole division after the withdrawal of the 368th Regiment was, beginning with September 29, transferred to the Metz sector, preparatory to the great drive on that fortress which was begun, rather needlessly, as the civilian would judge, on the day before the signing of the Armistice, November 10.\nAccording to plan, the 56th white American Division was on the left, the 92nd Division was in the center and the French Army was on the right. The 367th Regiment led the advance and forged ahead of the flanking units, the entire First Battalion being awarded the Croix de Guerre;—but this time wise field direction held them back, and for the first time they were supported by their own Negro Field Artillery. Beside the four Infantry Regiments the 92nd Division had the usual other units.\nThe 325th Field Signal Battalion, attached to Division Headquarters, was composed of four companies organized at Camp Sherman. It had then colored and twenty white officers. It was in France at Bourbonne-les-Bains and then went to the Vosges, where it was split into detachments and attached to regiments under the Chief Signal Officer. While at school at Gondrecourt, July 13–August 18, it made one of the best records of any unit. Many of its men were cited for bravery.\nThe 167th Field Artillery Brigade consisted of two regiments of Light Artillery (755) trained at Camp Dix (the 349th and 350th) and one regiment of Heavy Artillery (the 351st) trained at Camp Meade, which used 155 howitzers. They experienced extraordinary difficulties in training. There can be no doubt but that deliberate effort was made to send up for examination in artillery not the best, but the poorest equipped candidates. Difficulty was encountered in getting colored men with the requisite technical training transferred to the artillery service. If the Commanding Officer in this case had been as prejudiced as in the case of the engineer and other units, there would have been no Negro Artillery. But Colonel Moore, although a Southerner, insisted on being fair to his men. The brigade landed in Brest June 26 and was trained at Montmorillon (Vienne). They were favorites in the town and were received into the social life on terms of perfect equality. There were five colored company officers and eight medical officers. The officers were sent to school at La Courtine and the Colonel in charge of this French school said that the work of the colored artillery brigade was better at the end of two weeks than that of any other American unit that had attended the school. The brigade went into battle in the Metz drive and did its work without a hitch, despite the fact that it had no transport facilities for their guns and had to handle them largely by hand.\nThe 317th Ammunition Train, which was attached to Division Headquarters, but was under the artillery in battle, was organized at Camp Funston in December, and had 1,333 officers and men, divided into two battalions, one motor and one horse, with seven companies. There were thirty-three colored and three white officers. The battalion landed in France June 27 and went to Montmorillon, and to the Artillery Training School at La Courtine, with the 167th Field Artillery. It arrived at Marbach October 18 and took part in the Metz drive. It had charge, also, of the Corps Ammunition dumps. During the drive all the officers were colored and Major Dean was in command. General Sherbourne, one of the few Commanding Officers fair to Negro troops, warmly commended the work of the artillery. No general court martial took place in the organization from the beginning and no efficiency boards sat. This was one of the very few units in which Negroes were promoted; four being made Captains, three First Lieutenants, eleven Second Lieutenants, and one a Major.\nNear the close of the war thirty-five Lieutenants commissioned at Camp Taylor arrived in France and were sent to school near Nantes. They were subjected to many indignities by the American officers and were compelled to enter the class-room after the whites; they were refused leaves to town; reprimanded for conversing with the women of the city, who were anxious to be kind and sympathetic to the obviously oppressed strangers. Notwithstanding all this the men made good records and joined their command after the Armistice.\nThe 317th Engineers were assembled at Camp Sherman in December with 1,350 officers and men. There were two battalions and all the officers were colored, except four field officers. The Commanding Officers, however, were from the first determined to get rid of the Negroes. On May 10 the colored Captains were relieved, and sent to the 365th and 366th Regiments. The regiment came to France in June and was trained near Bourbonne-les Bains until July 20. On July 22 all the remaining colored officers, except two Lieutenants, the chaplain and the medical officers, were relieved at the repeated requests of Colonel Brown, of Georgia, and others. The regiment went to the Vosges in August, and then to the Argonne, doing excellent technical work in building and construction. All but one company were attached to the Fourth French Army Corps until December 22; only Company E remained with the 92nd Division.\nThe 366th Field Hospital was a colored unit with only two or three whites. It handled 10,000 cases before and during the Metz drive, four weeks, and was rated best in the American Expeditionary Force. Lieutenant Wright, the colored physician in charge, was promoted to a Captaincy.\nThe final engagement immediately preceding the signing of the Armistice was fought in the Marbache sector, south of Metz, and was the most important event in which all the units of the 92nd Division actively participated. The division entered this sector October 7 and established headquarters in the village of Marbache, October 10, 1918. The several regiments were stationed in the front lines of the Division sector, with supporting units and reserves in the rear. Almost immediately upon entering this sector active operations were begun; patrols and reconnoitering parties were sent out from our lines; raiding parties were active and both sides found it necessary to be constantly on the alert. As the time for the advance of the whole Second Army grew nearer heavy shelling became more frequent, patrolling more active and raiding parties bolder. It was necessary to obtain all possible information regarding the enemy’s movements and intentions before the advance began. There were many thrilling experiences in this sector during the four weeks preceding the final struggle.\nOn the tenth day of November came the order announcing the great drive and outlining the position of the 92nd Division in the line.\nAt 7 A.M. on the eleventh, the artillery broke loose with a terrific bombardment; this preparation lasted for a period of 42 minutes and was delivered upon the village of Bois Frehaut and the neighboring woods through which the infantry was to pass in its advance. In the meantime, the boys in the several companies composing the first assault line sprang from their trenches and with grim determination pushed themselves into “No Man’s Land” and into the woods in the direction of the great German fortification, the city of Metz. The first objective of the 365th Infantry was Bois Frehaut (woods) three miles in depth and two miles in width. Barbed wire entanglements were everywhere and German machine guns were sputtering and large cannon were sending forth their messengers of death in all directions. The 365th Machine Gun Company, the 37-M M Platoon and our artillery and infantrymen repulsed this murderous attack and after two hours of desperate fighting Bois Frehaut was taken by the 365th and held by the Second Battalion of that organization until the bugle sounded the call to cease firing at 11 o’clock on the following morning.\nThe attack was led by Company H under the command of Captain William W. Green with a detachment of Company A commanded by Lieutenant Gus Mathew—Chicago with Company G and two other units in support. In fighting through the dense woods, made more difficult by large volumes of smoke from bursting shells, the attacking line in Company H became thinned and before many of the men arrived after the Company merged from the woods a flanking movement was attempted by the German machine gunners, but the timely arrival of Company G under the command of Lieutenant Walter Lyons saved Company H from this added danger. During this attack the Machine Gun Company of the 365th was active in covering the advancing infantry and kept the enemy on the run, thus making it impossible for them to deliver an effective fire against the men in the assault wave. The second assault wave was under the command of Captain Walter R. Sanders who was, also, second in command of the Second Battalion of the 365th Infantry. The second wave, under heavy shell fire and gas bombs from the artillery, moved up to occupy the position first held by the Second Battalion. While making this advance Lieutenant Walter Lowe, commanding Company A, was gassed, but he remained with his company, directing its movements until a short time before the order came to cease firing on the morning of the eleventh.\nWhile the 365th Infantry was fighting like real heroes the units in the other battalions were doing exactly the same thing. The first objective reached by the 366th was Bois-de-boitotte. The units in the first assault wave moved over the top at exactly seven o’clock on the morning of November 10. The artillery laid down a barrage for the advancing troops and protected their advance as far as possible, but the terrific bombardment with gas, shrapnel and machine gun fire from the German trenches made progress difficult as well as extremely dangerous. The troops, accustomed as they were by this time to bursting shells and gas bombs, ignored all personal danger and fought their way to their first objective with but few casualties. The fighting was furious during the early part of the day, but the organization was able to capture and hold much ground, varying from three to five kilometers in depth.\nThe 367th Infantry occupied a position on the west side of the Moselle River. Two companies of the Second Battalion were in the first assault wave with others in support and reserve. The fighting units reached and held their objective and although the fighting was brisk the 367th did not lose a single man. With the darkness came a cessation of intensive action, the troops were reorganized and plans formulated for a renewal of the attack early the next morning.\nIn this general engagement the 92nd Division occupied a position a little southeast of the strong fortifications of Metz. The 165th French Division was on our right and the Seventh American Division was on our left and we kept in touch with both these divisions during the night and prepared for what subsequently proved to be the final struggle of the great world war the following morning.\nAt dawn the air was cool and damp; it was slightly cloudy, with a little fog in the atmosphere, just enough to give it a dull-gray color and to prevent the soldiers from seeing more than a few hundred yards in the direction of the enemy.\nThe keen whistling noises made by the shells from our supporting artillery as they passed over our heads on their missions of death told us that the hour was 4:30 A.M., for at that time the 351st Field Artillery Regiment began its advance upon Bois La Cote and Champeny. This fire was kept up continuously until 10:45. The 350th Field Artillery Regiment, also, renewed its attack upon the woods in the neighborhood of Bois Frehaut, but ceased firing at 10 o’clock A. M., forty-five minutes earlier than the 351st. At five o’clock the First Battalion of the 350th Field Artillery laid a rolling barrage across and just north of Bouxières-sur-Froidmont in support of the advancing infantry. Many of the same units that engaged the enemy the day before were again struggling for additional gains in the direction of Metz. Several fresh companies were brought up from the support to join those who had so gallantly repulsed the enemy on Saturday and together made a supreme effort to deliver a blow that would silence the German guns and put the Huns to flight in disorder. The only thing that saved the Kaiser’s army in this sector from a crushing defeat was the order to cease firing at 11 o’clock.\nAt one time during the morning engagement the 56th Infantry (white) of the 7th Division, while advancing, ran into a strong barbed wire entanglement that had not been destroyed by artillery. Further advance was impossible and to retire under heavy fire from the German’s big guns and merciless machine gun fire meant annihilation. Major Charles L. Appleton of the 367th Infantry, seeing the desperate situation into which the 56th Infantry had worked itself, maneuvered several platoons to a position where they could hit the Germans from the flank and cover the retirement of the 56th. This timely act on the part of Major Appleton probably saved the 56th from complete destruction.\nWhen the bugle sounded the call to cease firing, Company H of the 365th Infantry held 800 yards of the battle-front, five kilometers of which was taken from the Germans under the heavy guns of Metz, and held against odds five to one under intense shell and machine gun fire.\nMrs. Helen Curtis and Her Soldiers, at Chambery, France"

    "text": "Other Agencies\nSo much for the 92d Division. It never had a fighting chance until the last day of the war. It was a centre of intrigue from the beginning and its weak and vacillating General spent most of his time placating the Negro haters on his staff and among his field officers, who wished nothing so much as the failure of the division as a fighting unit. How different a story if Charles Young had been let to lead his own! Of the assisting agencies the only one that paid any attention to Negro troops was the Young Men’s Christian Association. The few who came to Red Cross hospitals were, with a few exceptions, not only “Jim-Crowed” but officers were put in wards with their men. The white Young Men’s Christian Association secretaries usually refused to serve Negroes in any way. Very few colored secretaries were sent and an attempt was made at first to get rid of the best of these, on the ground that their beliefs on the manhood rights and human equality of Negroes were “seditious.” Matters were greatly improved when a colored man was placed in general charge of the colored work. He was never, however, furnished enough men and only three women for his vast field until after the Armistice.\nOn one subject the white Commanding Officers of all colored units showed more solicitude than on the organization and fighting efficiency of the troops,—that was the relations of the colored officers and men with the women of France. They began by officially stigmatizing the Negroes as rapists; they solemnly warned the troops in speeches and general orders not even to speak to women on the street; ordered the white military police to spy on the blacks and arrest them if they found them talking with French women. The white troops, taking their cue from all this senseless pother, spread tales and rumors among the peasants and villagers and sought to chastise Negroes and offending women. One officer, a high-minded gentleman, graduate and Phi Beta Kappa man of a leading American institution, was court-martialed for keeping company with a perfectly respectable girl of a family of standing in one of the towns where Negroes were quartered and while General Headquarters did not uphold the court-martial, it took occasion severely to reprimand the officer and remove him to a Labor Battalion.\nThe result of all this a-do was simply unnecessary bitterness among Negroes and mystification among the French. The Negroes resented being publicly stigmatized by their own countrymen as unfit for association with decent people, but the French men and women much preferred the courtesy and bonhomie of the Negroes to the impudence and swagger of many of the whites. In practically every French town where the Negro troops stayed they left close and sympathetic friends among men, women and children.\nWhile the 92nd Division was in France there were fourteen trials for attacks on women, six of which were acquitted; of the other eight, three men were convicted of simple assault, leaving five possible cases of grave crime against women; of these, three cases are still undecided at this writing, one has been acquitted by the court, but the verdict has not been reviewed, and ONE man has been found guilty and hanged. It is only fair to add that this man belonged to a Labor Battalion and was sent to the division simply for trial. No other American division in France has a better record in this respect."

There is much in the tale that is missing and some mistakes, to be corrected by fuller information and reference to documents. But the main outlines are clear.\nA nation with a great disease set out to rescue civilization; it took the disease with it in virulent form and that disease of race-hatred and prejudice hampered its actions and discredited its finest professions.\nNo adequate excuse for America’s actions can be offered: Grant that many of the dismissed and transferred colored officers were incompetent, there is no possible excuse for the persistent and studied harrowing of admittedly competent men, to which every black officer testifies with a bitterness unexampled in Negro American history; there was no excuse for the persistent refusal to promote Negroes, despite their records testified to even by the French; there was no excuse for systematically refusing Negro officers and soldiers a chance to see something of greater and more beautiful France by curtailing their leaves and quartering them in the back districts.\nOn the other hand, there is not a black soldier but who is glad he went,—glad to fight for France, the only real white Democracy; glad to have a new, clear vision of the real, inner spirit of American prejudice. The day of camouflage is past.\nThis history will be enlarged and expanded, embellished with maps and pictures and with the aid of an editorial board, consisting of the leading Negro American scholars and the most distinguished of the black soldiers who fought in France, will be issued by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and The Crisis, in three volumes, in honor of the first great struggle of the modern Negro race for liberty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Black Man in the Revolution of 1914-1918 (1919)\nPromoting Race Prejudice (1917)\nMy Mission (1919)\nReturning Soldiers (1919)\nPresidential Candidates (1920)"

The enemy searched along the trails with their artillery during our withdrawal, but none of the shells fell near us; it was pitch dark by this time and we had just reached the German’s first trench. There was much confusion owing to the mass of wire we had to contend with in the dark before the companies reached the French trenches.” Company C spent the entire day of the twenty-sixth working its way through the wire entanglements. Great difficulty was experienced in this work because of the lack of wirecutters.”— Reports of Major M. A. Elser.↩︎"

    "text": "I went to Paris because today the destinies of mankind center there. Make no mistake as to this, my readers. Podunk may easily persuade itself that only Podunk matters and that nothing is going on in New York. The South Sea Islander may live ignorant and careless of London. Some Americans may think that Europe does not count, and a few Negroes may argue vociferously that the Negro problem is a domestic matter, to be settled in Richmond and New Orleans.\nBut all these careless thinkers are wrong. The destinies of mankind for a hundred years to come are being settled today in a small room of the Hotel Crillon by four unobtrusive gentlemen who glance out speculatively now and then to Cleopatra’s Needle on the Place de la Concorde.\nYou need not believe this if you do not want to. They do not care what you believe. They have the POWER. They are settling the world’s problems and you can believe what you choose as long as they control the ARMIES and NAVIES, the world supply of CAPITAL and the PRESS.\nOther folks of the world who think, believe and act;—THIRTY-TWO NATIONS, PEOPLES and RACES, have permanent headquarters in Paris. Not simply England, Italy and the Great Powers are there, but all the little nations; not simply little nations, but little groups who want to be nations, like the Letts and Finns, the Armenians and Jugo-Slavs, Irish and Ukrainians. Not only groups, but races have come—Jews, Indians, Arabs and All-Asia. Great churches, like the Greek Orthodox and the Roman Catholic, are watching on the ground. Great organizations, like the American Peace Society, the League to Enforce Peace, the American Federation of Labor, the Woman’s Suffrage Association and a hundred others are represented in Paris today.\nIn fine, not a single great, serious movement or idea in Government, Politics, Philanthropy or Industry in the civilized world has omitted to send and keep in Paris its Eyes and Ears and Fingers! And yet some American Negroes actually asked WHY I went to help represent the Negro world in Africa and America and the Islands of the Sea.\nBut why did I not explain my reasons and mission before going? Because I am not a fool. Because I knew perfectly well that any movement to bring the attention of the world to the Negro problem at this crisis would be stopped the moment the Great Powers heard of it. When, therefore, I was suddenly informed of a chance to go to France as a newspaper correspondent, I did not talk—I went.\nWhat did I do when I got there? First, there were certain things that I did NOT do. I did not hold an anti-lynching meeting on the Boulevard des Italiens. I would to God I could have, but I knew that France is still under martial law,—that no meeting can be held today in France, anywhere or at any time, without the consent of the Government; no newspaper can publish a line without the consent of the Censor and no individual can stay in France unless the French consent.\nBut it did not follow that because I could not do everything I could do nothing. I first went to the American Peace Commission and said frankly and openly: “I want to call a Pan-African Congress in Paris.” The Captain to whom I spoke smiled and shook his head. “Impossible,” he said, and added: “The French Government would not permit it.” “Then,” said I innocently: “It’s up to me to get French consent!” “It is!” he answered, and he looked relieved.\nWith the American Secret Service at my heels I then turned to the French Government. There are six colored deputies in the French Parliament and one is an under-secretary in the War Department. “Of course, we can have a Pan-African Congress,” he said—“I’ll see Clemenceau.” He saw Clemenceau, and there was a week’s pause. Clemenceau saw Pichon, and there was another pause. Meantime, our State Department chuckled and announced that there would be no Congress and refused Negroes passports. England followed suit and refused to allow the Secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society even to visit Paris, while the South African natives were not allowed to sail.\nBut there are six Negroes in the French House and Clemenceau needs their votes. There were 280,000 black African troops in the war before whom France stands with uncovered head. The net result was that Clemenceau, Prime Minister of France, gave us permission to hold the Pan-African Congress in Paris.\nWhat could a Pan-Afrian Congress do? I could not agitate the Negro problem in any particular country, except in so far as that problem could be plausibly shown to be part of the problem of the future of Africa. The problem of the future of Africa was a difficult and delicate question before the Peace Conference—so difficult and so delicate that the Conference was disposed to welcome advice and co-operation.\nIf the Negroes of the world could have maintained in Paris during the entire sitting of the Peace Conference a central headquarters with experts, clerks and helpers, they could have settled the future of Africa at a cost of less than $10,000.\nAs it was the Congress cost $750. Yet with this meagre sum a Congress of fifty-eight delegates, representing sixteen different Negro groups, was assembled. This Congress passed resolutions which the entire press of the world has approved, despite the fact that these resolutions had two paragraphs of tremendous significance to us:\n\nWherever persons of African descent are civilized and able to meet the tests of surrounding culture, they shall be accorded the same rights as their fellow citizens; they shall not be denied on account of race or color a voice in their own Government, justice before the courts and economic and social equality according to ability and desert.\n \nWhenever it is proven that African natives are not receiving just treatment at the hands of any State or that any State deliberately excludes its civilized citizens or subjects of Negro descent from its body politic and cultural, it shall be the duty of the League of Nations to bring the matter to the attention of the civilized world,\n\nPrecisely the same principles are being demanded today by the Jews and the Japanese. And despite the enormous significance of these demands, Colonel House of the American Peace Commission received me and assured me that he wished these resolutions presented to the Peace Conference. Lloyd George wrote me that he would give our demands “his careful consideration.” The French Premier offered to arrange an audience for the President and Secretary of the Conference. Portugal and Belgium, great colonial powers, offered complete co-operation.\nThe League for the Rights of Man, which freed Dreyfus, appointed a special commission to hear not only of the African, but the facts as to the American Negro problem.\nWe got, in fact, the ear of the civilized world and if it had been possible to stay longer and organize more thoroughly and spread the truth,—what might not have been accomplished?\nAs it was, we have organized the “Pan-African Congress” as a permanent body, with M. Diagne as president and myself as secretary, and we plan an international quarterly BLACK REVIEW to be issued in English, French and possibly in Spanish and Portuguese.\nThe world-fight for black rights is on!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nA Statement (1919)\nLondon (1911)\nViolations of Property Rights (1911)\nStarvation and Prejudice (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “My Mission.” The Crisis 18\n(1): 7–9. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/01/my_mission.html."

    "text": "We are returning from war! The Crisis and tens of thousands of black men were drafted into a great struggle. For bleeding France and what she means and has meant and will mean to us and humanity and against the threat of German race arrogance, we fought gladly and to the last drop of blood; for America and her highest ideals, we fought in far-off hope; for the dominant southern oligarchy entrenched in Washington, we fought in bitter resignation. For the America that represents and gloats in lynching, disfranchisement, caste, brutality and devilish insult—for this in the hateful upturning and mixing of things, we were forced by vindictive fate to fight, also.\nBut today we return! We return from the slavery of uniform which the world’s madness demanded us to don to the freedom of civil garb. We stand again to look America squarely in the face and call a spade a spade. We sing: This country of ours, despite all its better souls have done and dreamed, is yet a shameful land.\nIt lynches.\nAnd lynching is barbarism of a degree of contemptible nastiness unparalleled in human history. Yet for fifty years we have lynched two Negroes a week, and we have kept this up right through the war.\nIt disfranchises its own citizens.\nDisfranchisement is the deliberate theft and robbery of the only protection of poor against rich and black against white. The land that disfranchises its citizens and calls itself a democracy lies and knows it lies.\nIt encourages ignorance.\nIt has never really tried to educate the Negro. A dominant minority does not want Negroes educated. It wants servants, dogs, whores and monkeys. And when this land allows a reactionary group by its stolen political power to force as many black folk into these categories as it possibly can, it cries in contemptible hypocrisy: “They threaten us with degeneracy; they cannot be educated.”\nIt steals from us.\nIt organizes industry to cheat us. It cheats us out of our land; it cheats us out of our labor. It confiscates our savings. It reduces our wages. It raises our rent. It steals our profit. It taxes us without representation. It keeps us consistently and universally poor, and then feeds us on charity and derides our poverty.\nIt insults us.\nIt has organized a nation-wide and latterly a world-wide propaganda of deliberate and continuous insult and defamation of black blood wherever found. It decrees that it shall not be possible in travel nor residence, work nor play, education nor instruction for a black man to exist without tacit or open acknowledgment of his inferiority to the dirtiest white dog. And it looks upon any attempt to question or even discuss this dogma as arrogance, unwarranted assumption and treason.\nThis is the country to which we Soldiers of Democracy return. This is the fatherland for which we fought! But it is our fatherland. It was right for us to fight. The faults of our country are our faults. Under similar circumstances, we would fight again. But by the God of Heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if now that that war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land.\nWe return.\nWe return from fighting.\nWe return fighting.\nMake way for Democracy! We saved it in France, and by the Great Jehovah, we will save it in the United States of America, or know the reason why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThirteen (1918)\nClose Ranks (1918)\nHelp Us to Help (1918)\nAwake America (1917)\nThe Present (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “Returning Soldiers.”\nThe Crisis 18 (1): 12–13. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/01/returning_soldiers.html."

For beauty of face and form and robing, for fine fellowship and joy of life it may well be doubted if these gatherings have ever been equalled in the United States. Assemble the nations of earth and say what you will, there is nothing in white Europe or America that can measure up to the wonderful colorings of flesh, grace of movement and rhythm of music such as Black America can furnish.

    "text": "There was once a man who said that if he owned Hell and Texas, he would prefer to rent out Texas and live in Hell. He may have exaggerated, but he had some supporting facts: Texas was settled by white Southerners in order to extend slave territory; it was forcibly stolen from Mexico in 1837, largely because Mexico tried to abolish slavery in 1829. Thereupon Texas became a center of the African slave trade and the “most shameful violations” of United States slave trade laws were perpetrated through Texas. During the years of Texan independence slaves were rushed in at the rate of 15,000 or more a year and the annexation of Texas and the Mexican War were movements to extend Negro slavery.\nOut of this past has risen the present Texas. In that state the first public burning alive of a Negro took place, at Paris. Since 1889 Texas has lynched 338 human beings—standing second only to Georgia and Mississippi in this horrible eminence.\nNotwithstanding this, the Texas Negro has forged forward. Encouraged by his first great leader, Norris Wright Cuney, he has bought 21,182 farms with nearly two million acres of land, worth $25,000,000. Starting with nothing fifty years ago nearly one-third of these black folk are now land owners.\nTo reward the Negroes for their thrift and struggles Texas gives them no voice in their own government, taxes them without representation and enforces “Jim-Crow” travel, more irksome than in any other state because of the immense Texas distances. The Negro schools of Texas are better than in many Southern States and there are forty-four high schools for the 690,049 Negroes of the state, but 25 per cent of the Negro population is still absolutely illiterate and according to the white Houston Post: “The rural schools for Negro children where they exist at all are a joke.”\nIs it not natural for the Negroes of such a state to endeavor to escape slavery?\nThey turned to the N.A.A.C.P. quite without solicitation. We made no special effort to organize branches in Texas, but 7,000 black Texans joined us to help make twelve million Americans “physically free from peonage, mentally free from ignorance, politically free from disfranchisement and socially free from insult.”\nIs this revolution? Is this “stirring up trouble?” It is—in Texas, and to stop it a number of Texas gentlemen leaped on one unsuspecting, unarmed man and beat him nearly into unconsciousness, because he had come to their state to confer with colored and white people in the interests of this organization.\nMr. Shillady is a gentleman of training and experience, known to social workers all over the land. He was set upon by a judge, a constable and other officials, who have openly boasted their lawlessness and have been upheld by the Governor of the State.\nThis is Texas. This is the dominant white South. This is the answer of the Coward and the Brute to Reason and Prayer. This is the thing that America must conquer before it is civilized, and as long as Texas is this kind of Hell, civilization in America is impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPrejudice (1911)\nSlavery (1922)\nHouston (1917)\nMurder Will Out (1920)\nCarrizal (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “Shillady and Texas.”\nThe Crisis 18 (6): 283–84. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/06/shillady_and_texas.html."

    "title": "The Riot at Longview, Texas",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Comparatively few people know of the race riot which was a precursor of the more serious outbreaks in Washington, Chicago and Knoxville. Last June, at Longview, in the state of Texas of ill-fame, a colored man, Lemuel Walters, was arrested and jailed on the charge of having been found in a white woman’s room. On the 22nd of June, Professor Jones, one of the leading colored citizens of Longview, stopped at the jail to deliver the colored papers, for which he was agent, and was told by three colored and one white inmate that Walters had been spirited away by a mob of white men. Subsequently the Longview Leader spoke of an unidentified Negro who had been found shot to death near the railroad. This Negro, Professor Jones believed to have been Lemuel Walters.\nThereupon Professor Jones and Dr. Davis with nine other colored citizens approached Erskine H. Bramlette, County Judge of Gregg County, and as representatives of the colored people asked for an investigation. The judge merely asked the names of the four prison inmates and counselled profound secrecy. After a brief d&gt;2lay the committee visited the judge again. On this occasion he professed his utter powerlessness, but promised to refer the matter to the District Attorney. He also sought more information as to the names and descriptions of the prisoners who had supplied the information. Later on the reason for this interest was made clear, for when three days later Professor Jones went back to the jail, he found the prisoners had been taken away.\nThus much for the prologue.\nAt this point the Chicago Defender stepped in and on July 5 published a statement that the white woman whose name had been originally connected with Walters was really in love with him, would have been glad to become his wife and was deeply stricken by his death. The Defender also declared that the sheriff had seen the mob pass into the jail and was, therefore, an accessory before the fact.\nThe sequel was immediate. On July 10, Professor Jones was accosted and horribly beaten, struck and cut over the head with a wrench and otherwise badly injured. Even then he defended himself and managed to break away from his assailants—three white men—but he tripped, fell headlong and while still on the ground was beaten even more violently. His crime, he was told, was that of being responsible for the statement which had occurred in the Defender. Vigorously denying this charge he broke away, got some relief from his friend, Dr. Davis, and then repeated his denial in person to J. J. Ross, Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce.\nBut the mischief had started. Deputy Sheriff Harrison told an old colored man that Jones would be lynched before midnight unless he had already left town. Davis was told of this and consulted several prominent white men in the town, including Mayor G. A. Bodenheim. Not even the official would promise any help, but simply advised both Jones and Davis to leave town. Instead of following this advice, Dr. Davis got together a group of men and laid the matter before them. They decided to defend themselves by defending Professor Jones and Dr. Davis.\nEven then Dr. Davis hoped for a change in the attitude of the whites. But when he found that, although the mayor, other officials and some leading citizens had convened, still no help was promised, he prepared for the worst. He instructed his guard to surround Jones’ house and hold themselves in readiness for an attack, but on no account was any one to shoot into the houses of white people or to fire until he himself had done so.\nClose on midnight the mob came down the street. Four white men mounted the back porch and called for Jones to come out. Not until he was sure that their plan was to rush the house did Dr. Davis open fire. In the violent scrimmage which followed no colored men were killed, but it is reported that the manager of the Kelly Plow Works admitted the death of eleven white men,\nThe mob withdrew. Professor Davis cautiously went back to the town. There was some talk on the part of the whites of a return attack, but they seemed to lack leaders. All about were signs of confusion and distress. White women were heard lamenting the foolhardiness which had prompted their men to such an attack. Automobiles rushed back and forth, their inmates picking up the dead and wounded and carrying them back to their homes. Thus the night wore on. But at daybreak, as Dr. Davis had suspected, the mob foregathered again. This time arson was the weapon. Professor Jones’ house—from which he had already escaped—and that of Dr. Davis were burned to the ground. The family of Dr. Davis was permitted to escape. But an innocent householder and his wife who lived opposite Professor Jones lost not only their house, but were themselves shot and seriously injured.\nBoth Professor Jones and Dr. Davis reached a place of safety. Professor Jones hid in Longview until the following night and then got away. Dr. Davis disguised himself as a soldier, boarded a train, rode a short distance and dismounted. But his really difficult moments passed when through a misunderstanding he arrived at the station two hours too early for the train by which he hoped to continue his flight. He dared not risk returning to the friends who had been protecting him. It was equally inadvisable for him to show anxiety or fear. So he bought popcorn, soft drinks and the like, and hung about the station—laughing, singing, eating and shooting “crap” in most approved “darky” style. Finally the train came up with colored soldiers in it. He made his plight known to them and was supplied with an overseas cap and gas mask which made his disguise complete.\nThe riot at Longview has two aspects. First, simply and solely it is a fair sample of the lawlessness which at present is stalking restlessly through the nation, Secondly, it is indicative of the attitude which Negroes are determined to adopt for the future. As the Associated Press report (it appeared, by the way, in a Longview paper), has it: “Negroes are not planning anything, but will defend themselves if attacked.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPrejudice (1911)\nCoffeeville, Kanasas (1927)\nLynching (1928)\nCowardice (1916)\nThe Old Story (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, National. 1919.\n“The Riot at Longview, Texas.” The Crisis 18 (6):\n291–92. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/06/riot_at_longview.html."

Mr. Byrnes was elected to Congress by a vote of 7,681 ballots out of a total of 7,801 ballots cast.\nIn the Second District of New York it took, the same year, 46,141 votes to make an election and 24,064 of these to elect a Congressman; but all this is not necessary in South Carolina.\nYet Mr. Byrnes, representing without any legal authority the suppressed votes of 12,000 white men and 20,000 blacks, stands in Congress and talks just as loud—indeed, considerably louder—than Mr. Caldwell of New York.\nMr. Byrnes is alarmed, and so are we. He is alarmed over us and we over him. He accuses The Crisis and other Negro journals of causing not only the Washington and Chicago riots, but the whole unrest and dissatisfaction in the Negro race. We accuse Mr. Byrnes, and his kind, of being primarily the ones who not only precipitated the riots in Washington, Chicago, Atlanta, Houston, Longview and East St. Louis, but also of encouraging for fifty years the lynching of 4,000 Negroes, the disfranchisement of a million and a half voters, the enforced ignorance of three million human beings and the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars in wages, but particularly the theft of the highest privilege of a freeman—our vote and our self-respect.\nFollowing the advice and example of the alarmed Mr. Byrnes, we have called this situation “to the attention of” the President, the Attorney-General and the United States Congress “with the request that they have proceedings instituted” against Byrnes, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\nAnd we have intimated to them in the chaste language of our friend that “steps should be taken against the use” of the Congressional Record “for the Bolshevik and the I.W.W.”\nMeantime, may we not cordially thank Congressman Byrnes for allowing some seventy-five millions of our fellow-citizens to read a Crisis editorial which might otherwise have reached a bare million?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Election (1924)\nThe Negro Voter (1928)\nPolitical Straws (1923)\nRemember (1920)\nThe Newest South (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nW.E.B., Du Bois. 1919. “Byrnes.” The Crisis 18\n(6): 284–85. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/18/06/byrnes.html."

I have seen England and France many times—all parts of Germany and something of Austria, Switzerland and Italy.\nBut all this (save Armenia) was white, kindly on the whole—intensely interesting, but painfully white. Today I am drifting toward darkness. I have seen the skin grow sallow and the eyes darken and hair quiver, in southern France, in Spain, in Portugal, in the Canary Isles; and now I set my face toward Africa—the Eternal World of Black Folk.\nThere is a snow capped peak that sits in the seas. With grey mantilla about its silvered hair Teneriffe frowns on the Canaries and the Canaries smile on the waters, the waters love Africa and Africa frowns on God.\nA long way—a long, long way have I come to this gate of the darkest world.\nI was in England at the beginning of that singular election campaign which astonished Europe and in the end revealed the bankruptcy of traditional England. It was a cold, wet England with here and there the white sunshine of promise. It was an England on the farewell evening of the Imperial Conference. No black men were there, but brown men sat and spoke and were listened to. England fears India. Only Smuts replied. Smuts, that curious, provincial mind—German in sympathy, suspicious of France and its black armies, liberal toward all white folk but hating “niggers” and fearing East Indians. He is today the greatest leader in the British Empire. In this atmosphere Pan Africa sat and whispered. But some few listened.\nI was in France when the first signs came that the hegemony of future mid-European industry, with all its inherent political power, had passed from Germany to France, with England helplessly and jealously watching. The capitalists of the Ruhr, German and French, are agreed. The world will pay. And yet there is one vast beacon of light—France is depending for her hegemony of Europe on Africa. If the rest of Europe wishes to meet her racial bid, they too must make peace—industrial and racial peace—with Africa.\nAt St. Etienne the most popular man in town—the head of the French and Foreign Club, the chief sportsman, the guest of a hundred hosts, and the welcomed of all business men—is one of us—Hunt, the only American Consul of Negro descent in Europe. The State Department is worried over Hunt. He deserves promotion and they dare not promote him.\nSuddenly leaving all this weary world of politics and industry I plunged headlong into fairyland. I am riding down the Rhone. I see the seen and the unseen. The unseen drama of a thousand years and yet nine hundred more. The Allobroges—the Dukes of Burgundy—the Kings of France, shining in the sun and river, the banks rising to mountain heights to westward, the fields and cities, eastward. The colors are pale cream, grey, pale reds, above the blues and greens and browns. The towns are solid, stolid, almost grim, with poplars sternly at attention and vines and tile and wall and tower. Yet there is a kindliness and sweetness in the air—a sense of hearth and home amid factory and swift commerce—the long black steamers, the fruit trees, the pale high hills. The scene stretches into wide plateaus before the dream-far mountains. Then comes a great shoulder of naked rock, a towered town of cream and crimson, sun fields, a mauve and white chateau in trees, the ribbon of river and its poplars; suddenly a gray town with ruined castle on the skies, a river blazing in the sun. From a hill to the right the ghost of the twelfth century stares stonily down upon us. Valence, town of the Gauls, which knew Roman, Visigoth, Lombard and Moor. Upon the right walls that in centuries gone rang with the laughter of the Lady of Poitiers—naughty, beautiful, dead Diana; fair, false and fortunate, are ruins eternal above the waters of the Rhone. To the left a quiet town with one arm clasped lovingly about a hill and the other flung above the river rampart. Opposite the dream of cloudy mountains and vines, yonder a town embroidering a hillside, a solemn cypress here and there and a touch of gay color on roof and door proclaim the coming of the azure coast. Out of earth and mountain leaps on before us another town pale gray and cream, petite and beautiful with light. I see a flying buttress, the towers of a Byzantium church dominating the town and then in applause rock and boulder, rough and hard and grim. On the other side in blue and grayish purple a mighty tower and wall and city with what wonder of past hate and love and war! The ruins of a dead chateau guarding a little golden street; a lonely town of clustered grey crouching on the earth as if a part of it—with wealth of rolling tiles.\nThen darkness came down, came down quickly at four and enveloped the widening plane—fell on the tower of Avignon and on the bridge where tout le monde y danse en ronde. On to Arles and Mistral and his song “Have you been to Carcassonne?” But in the soft darkness my soul, free, ranged all Provence and its sweet and unseen beauty.\nAvignon was shadow and dying day—the shadow of the Palace of the Shadow of the Popes somewhere down between me and the bridge.\nSo in the darkness we came down to where Marseilles beneath the moon shone like a jewel in a jewelled sea.\nOh but it rained in Marseilles! The waters spilled themselves across the city and under and over it all my one day and yet could not quench it, could not quite spare its laughter and charm, its satisfied provincial large-town air. The little “Cannebière” was gay and crowded and wet. The bouillabaisse at What’s-his-name’s (everybody knows him) was expensive and bad, but the great yellow castles that guard the mighty harbor and the little winding sinister streets where folk pass sideways to the seas—they were all there and they are Marseilles."

    "text": "II\nI have been to Carcassonne. I have seen the city, sitting like a tale that is told above the earth, a great grey dim and towered thing amid a universe of purple, yellow, brown and green—a far-flung violet heaven on earth, a clustering church-quartered town. On the plain march the great figures of France, while yonder the Pyrenees snow-crowned look on. I have seen the sun die on the ramparts of Carcassonne and as it died the Pyrenees lived. They raised a song that swelled from Marseilles to Barcelona and from earth right up to the blue gold of Heaven. But the earth empurpled died and sank and smoked a thousand candles and cried a thousand wordless tales. The air was like rare wine—the earth beautiful for a lover, the sky fleeced and gilded silver and purple.\nThe sun falls. Smoke threads up from the nests of tiles. Goats cry, a mist, mysterious, sweeps the purply air and on the ramparts I stand and peer.\nAs night rose the sky was green and black and gold above the black ramparts fading to white and blue, while afar the grim teeth of the Pyrenees grated on Heaven.\nI rose in the night to see what the moon could do to all this. It dripped but shadows on the scene.\nThen came the drab cold morning of disillusion. After all this grey rock stained with blood and tears was but an old machine of murder, of desperate defense against desperate men. Its ever winding streets were alleys where hid poverty and filth. About the ramparts without filth still lay and within in inn and guide lurked bold extortion. And yet Carcassonne rose above all triumphant in its crumpled beauty, its sheer and pregnant human appeal—its hoarse voice of seven hundred years, with ghosts of three hundred more. In the tournament range, facing the court of Honor, there are telephone wires.\nSun and cloud, Mediterranean and Pyrenees, yellowing vines and sheep. The vines have leaves like flowers and the purple sea mirrors old castellated towers in yellow and red beneath the black forbidding Pyrenees.\nThe Pyrenees romp with heaven, play with earth cloud and sun until together they make superb lace work.\nBlack cedars, two towers of castled keeps, gold trees, grey walls, white roads and vines and vines.\n\nBarcelona is a great city thrusting herself outside her swaddling clothes with an effort which rends her body and soul. Great avenues are shouldering aside and threading tiny, winding Old World streets and building new blocks scornful of span with rounded corners and great inner courts. One has a feeling of strident wealth and deep hidden misery, but one cannot tell. A few things I shall remember:—that great cathedral of gloom at Barcelona with the lovely loneliness of its high windows, the fearsome shadow of the grave of its crypt and its singularly beautiful cloisters. The church was a sort of monumental darkness thrown against the gayety of the Rampas.\nThen came a serious and savage Spain—bare nests of mountains with yellow towns creeping close to the earth.\n\nAlways and everywhere there is going on a subtle change. My brown face attracts no attention. I am darker than my neighbors but they are dark. I become, quite to my own surprise, simply a man. I cease to be specially selected for attention either elaborately pleasant or ostentatiously contemptible. Forgetting myself I study others. I feel relieved.\n\nMadrid is disappointing. It is artificial. Its ancient soul and body have been cut away and there remain the empty Prado, the wide and ghostly park, the ranging avenues and the empty countryside. It is a city set upon a hill, but the edges of the hill are guarded from the curious. And yet I may be wrong. After all I stayed but a day at Madrid and I saw Goya writhing in oil and Goya was more than Madrid.\n\nLisbon is a lovely city, rising in great swelling of hills, deep creams and crimson above the sea and the calm Tagus. It is a provincial city—a city of one street and the Rocio, but a city that is happy and knows its citizens by name and is sorry for the rest of Europe. I like Lisbon. It was kind and more than hospitable. I went to the Colliseum and sat by the ringside. My neighbor explained matters carefully in polite French. He accepted a cigarette and commended its flavor. At the end he raised his hat and bowed and bade me a very good night. Imagine him in the Hippodrome, New York! He would have shouldered me warily and explained on the other side the ubiquity of “damn niggers”!\n\nSunset at Funchal in Madeira. The little roar of the little town is softened by the mouth of bells and the curled new moon kisses the electric stars. Above glow the mountains with veils across their misty shoulders—bells, rain and blue sky, green and white homes and the soft laughter of dark eyes—Funchal. With a great circling rainbow day dies. At dawn the fingers of God touch the hills above and they glow with green and gold.\n\nThe ship is black and white and red. It sails tomorrow and when my feet again touch earth—the earth will be Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWorld War and the Color Line (1914)\nTravel (1926)\nPan-Africa and New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nMy Mission (1919)\nHelping Africa (1924)"

    "text": "From time to time persons write us for a brief statement of the reasons for capitalizing the word Negro.\nThe ordinary rules of capitalization enjoin the use of a capital letter for all proper nouns, all names of tribes, races, sects or organized bodies of men.\nFor this reason the word Negro when referring to a race of men has always been capitalized until late in the Nineteenth Century. With the defense of Negro slavery in those days there grew up the custom of using the small letter for the word since Negroes were looked upon as “real estate” or as moveable property like horses, cows, etc.\nAt the same time the great increase in printing and use of printing machines led to a disuse of capital letters in many cases where they had formerly been used and a great distaste to resorting to them among printers of English. Consequently the rule books used in most printing offices today say that capitals shall be used for the names of all nations and races “except Negro.” This has been defended by saying that Negro is not the name of a race but the description of the color of a people, being correlative with white, yellow, etc.\nThis argument is manifestly false. Black is the correlative of white and Negro does not describe color since all the persons designated as Negroes are by no means black, even in Africa. If, therefore, we follow analogy we cannot refuse to capitalize Negro when we capitalize Caucasian, Malay, Indian, Chinese, etc. Not to capitalize Negro under such circumstances is a direct, and in these days a more and more conscious, insult to at least 150,000,000 human beings and no person or institution will persist in this insult if they realize that these people regard the usage as such.\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “That Capital ‘N.’” The Crisis. 11(4):184.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNegro (1914)\nThat Capital ‘N’ (1930)\nThe Capital N (1930)\nVeiled Insults (1914)\nThe Name Negro (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “That Capital ‘N’.”\nThe Crisis 11 (4): 184. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/04/that_capital_n.html."

A Connecticut paper makes Coleridge-Taylor an Australian. Hundreds of men of Negro blood have had their achievements lost to the race because the matter of their color has been conveniently forgotten since their death. In this way one easily sees what a certain E.S. Cox, a “graduate student” of Vanderbilt University means when he announces jauntily that all human culture has risen from white folk; the colored races have contributed nothing to civilization and when white races become mixed with colored blood they “decline.” It is hardly necessary to argue with such a man. One may simply say flatly that the thesis is absolutely false and can only be maintained by claiming as “white” every group and every individual that has given anything to human culture. With this method the Egyptians, the Abyssinians, the East Indians and three-fourths of the African peoples and all of Mediterranean races become “white.” Such a definition is nonsense. Civilization started with colored races and colored races and colored men have always been among its greatest standard bearers, the “graduate student” to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPan-Africa and New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nLight (1912)\nConduct, Not Color (1916)\nA Statement (1919)\nCorrespondence (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Lies Agreed Upon.”\nThe Crisis 11 (4): 187. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/04/lies_agreed_upon.html."

Major Young was born in Kentucky and educated in Ohio, as we have already noted in the pages of The Crisis. He is forty-eight years of age, strongly built, and physically fit. He has just been assigned command of the 2nd Squadron of the 10th Cavalry stationed in Arizona. Every effort was made by the State Department to retain him in Liberia, where his work was invaluable, but the Department of War refused to make an exception in his case under the “Man- chu” Law; and this was well. We hope yet to see Major Young at the head of the constabulary in Haiti.\nBut it is not because of this man’s military career that he was chosen as the recipient of the Spingarn medal; nor was it solely because of his brilliant civic service in Haiti, in Liberia and in California; but rather because of a certain unusually fine quality of spirit.\nFew people know what Major Young suffered at West Point. There was no refinement of cruelty and insult that was not heaped on this black boy by his white fellows in the first three years of his career to drive him out of the institution. The same kind of social difficulties and temptations faced him during his early career in the army. He has faced insult as he has faced his daily bread, and with the same imperturbable balance and determination.\nHe has not only faced death in war, but—what is much more difficult—he has faced it in peace. When he last returned to Africa after an unusually severe attack of Black Water Fever not one of his friends expected to see him alive again. It was a piece of bravery almost foolhardy; but he went and won and comes back strong and ready for further sacrifices.\nThe Liberian Government has expressed its “grateful appreciation of the most valuable services by Major Young,” services “which will always stand as a monument to the Major’s name in the military annals of the Republic.”\nThe Adjutant-General of the United States says of the Liberian frontier: “It has been only with the most careful advisory supervision of Major Young that peace and order has been maintained.”\nLeonard Wood, Major-General of the United States Army, says that Major Young’s “service in the army has been highly creditable to his race from every standpoint.”\nThis is the man whom this Association is honoring itself by honoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTo the Rescue (1916)\nOfficers (1917)\nSoldiers (1919)\nThe Negro Soldier (1919)\nBaker (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “Young.” The Crisis 11 (5):\n240, 242. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/05/young.html."

    "text": "Colored St. Louis and its friends are today fighting for life and breath. It has been a fight not simply against the enemy, but also an inner fight. This is as it must be, although most of us forget it. Most of us assume that the colored people know their rights and want them and are ready to fight for them. On the contrary, what slavery means is that its victims should be uncertain as to their place in the world; as to just what they really want; and as to their readiness to strive for the satisfaction of those wants.\nThis was the case in St. Louis. When the segregation proposal came up the masses of the colored people were indifferent. “We are already segregated,” they said, “and what, pray, is the difference between customary segregation and legal segregation?” A large number of business men openly and publicly favored segregation when they scented a monopoly of colored business.\nOnly a few, then, were willing to start the active campaign. Most of the ministers came to the rescue and opened their churches; contributions were made to a campaign fund; literature was printed, lawyers hired and by and by headquarters were opened. An auxiliary committee of prominent white people was finally gotten together consisting of a former president of the City Club, a Unitarian pastor, a city judge, a secretary of the City League, several prominent lawyers and the secretary of the City Club. The election was set for February twenty-ninth. The colored people were finally aroused, registered in large numbers and voted against segregation almost to a man. Yet there were only 15,000 colored voters and considerably over 100,000 whites. Thus is the colored American in the hands of his white friends.\nThe Post Dispatch said in a closing editorial:\n\nUndoubtedly the conditions now existing, in cities particularly, create a problem difficult to deal with. Race prejudice is a fact, not a theory, and some concessions of strict principle have to be made to avoid trouble in emergencies. But serious as the consequences of the mixture of the races sometimes are, we do not believe it to be wise to violate the principles of liberty and justice in order to save a few individuals from loss and trouble. The present conditions entail loss to individuals, but the enforcement of segregation affects fundamental principles and thus may bear upon the welfare of all the people.\n \nSelf-interest and prejudice may make segregation popular enough to carry, but we do not believe it will survive. We believe that in the long run temporary victory for segregation will end in permanent defeat. Certainly intelligent people who see the significance and the inevitable drift of such a measure should vote against it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEast St. Louis (1917)\nResolutions of the Washington Conference (1917)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nSeparation (1911)\nAmity (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “St. Louis.” The Crisis 11\n(5): 240. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/05/st_louis.html."

    "text": "In the general results of last month’s elections there is not much to interest the American Negro but there are several significant points. First, the Vote for Woman Suffrage: There is no doubt of the decisive part which the Negro vote played in New Jersey and in Pennsylvania. In New Jersey, as the Philadelphia North American says: “The Negro vote defeated the Woman Suffrage amendment in New Jersey. This assertion is made without qualification by suffrage workers and others who have studied the returns of last Tuesday’s balloting.” On the other hand, in Pennsylvania with its 50,000 Negro voters the woman’s cause must have gained a very large proportion of this vote. What made the difference between New Jersey and Pennsylvania? The answer is simple. Pennsylvania took special pains to educate Negro voters on Woman Suffrage. New Jersey did practically nothing. What other result could you expect?\nA very excellent lesson was taught the Republican party in New York City. In spite of desperate efforts of politicians to gerrymander Harlem the Negro has a large vote in the 21st and 31st assembly districts. In each one of these the colored people put up candidates. In the 31st district Mr. John M. Royal polled 878 votes against 760 for the Republican candidate allowing the Democratic candidate to win by a minority vote. This puts the proposition squarely up to the Republican party in Harlem: If the Negro voter stands firm and the Republicans want to win them they must win with a Negro candidate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nVotes for Women (1918)\nThe Election (1924)\nSuffrage and Women (1915)\nThe Election (1910)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “The Elections.” The Crisis\n11 (2): 70. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/02/elections.html."

This proclamation contains certain smooth promises of benevolent guardianship in Haiti with no intention to interfere with the political integrity in Haiti. Recently, however, the veil of the State Department has been partially withdrawn and inquirers are now told by letter over the signature of A.A. Adee, the second assistant secretary of State: “In reply to your request for a statement of our purposes in Haiti, the Department begs to inform you that it has refrained, for the time being, from making public any statement regarding its policy in Haiti.” We notice, too, that a southern white man has been appointed American minister to Haiti. His name is Blanchard and we believe that he is from Louisiana. We would like to know if this Blanchard is related to the Blanchard who signed the following advertisement in the Shreveport, La., Times, January 10, 1908.\n\nTo the Colored Citizens of the Parish of Caddo\n  We notice at a meeting of the colored citizens at the Antioch Baptist Church a few evenings ago, that they passed resolutions endorsing the prohibition movement in the parish of Caddo, and have pledged themselves to aid in the moral wave, which they claim is now sweeping the country. So far we have no objection, but we wish to say to the colored voters of Caddo parish that the present prohibition contest is a white man’s tight, and that they must not take part in it. We have had various offers of assistance from the colored voters for the anti-prohibition cause, and our answer to them has been that they should not attempt to vote in the coming election on January 14th.\n  We do this in all kindness to the colored man, believing that he should not attempt to obtrude himself in this tight, which is purely a contest between the white citizens of this parish. We do it because of the memory which we have of the dark days of Reconstruction when one race was arrayed against the other, and when no man’s life was safe in the state of Louisiana. We do not wish to appear dictatorial in this matter, but we are determined that this question shall be settled by the intelligent white voters of the parish of Caddo, and our colored friends may resolute as much as they please, but we warn them now, once and for all, that they must not attempt to vote either for one side or the other. We do not believe in Negro domination on either side of this question, and while we are sure that more colored people would vote for prohibition, yet as white men, believing in the rule of the Caucasian, we cannot tolerate their interference in this election.

It is a church of Peace; and its followers are at war. It is a church of the Masses in theory while in practice it is a church of the Classes. It is an organization which despises wealth and yet which finds wealth its only modern weapon. In fine,—as a follower of Jesus, the Jew,—it professes the sublimest of ethical codes and yet falls so far from following it that some would deny that it is Christian.\nThe Negro church in America comes nearer to being built along the lines of its Founder. It is a democratic church of the masses; it welcomes all men despite race or color; and its wide activities touch every line of human endeavor. Nevertheless, the Negro church today in all its branches faces a peculiar crisis. The 3,000,000 Baptists, who represent more nearly than any other branch the great rank and file of the colored people, are torn asunder over a detail of organization. The African Methodist church must put strong material in its leadership or it will drift into sectional disruption, or personal feuds. The Colored Methodist Episcopal church is passing through a regrettable ethical slough of despond in high places; while the Zion church is having financial troubles. The colored Congregationalists are still a remnant. The colored Episcopalians are as babes overlaid by their none-too-loving mother; while the colored Presbyterians are spiritually harassed. The great Methodist Episcopal church has a strong element which is seeking to drive out its colored membership in order to welcome the white South.\nFacing such problems what shall we do? The appeal is first of all to the mighty past. In slavery, in Reconstruction and in the days after the Negro church made the Negro race in America. Today it can remake it if it calls to the front its strong, honest men; if it puts aside petty sectarianism and creed, and if it works for social uplift and individual honor. Will the church do this? In the long run and after much travail of soul we believe it will.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Church and the Negro (1913)\nSteal (1920)\nCrime (1918)\nThe Church and Religion (1933)\nThe Negro Church (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “The Church.” The Crisis 11\n(6): 302. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/06/church.html."

Church of Norfolk, Va., and the St. Mark’s M.E. Church of New York City.\nDixwell Avenue Congregational Church was established in 1820 when a white man, Simeon S. Jocelyn, gathered in New Haven twenty-four colored persons to teach them. He met much abuse and received many threats from the whites, but his congregation grew until in 1829 they became a regular Congregational Church.\nThis church called to its pastorate in 1836 the celebrated colored man, the Rev. J.W.C. Pennington. Pennington, who was born a slave, became one of the best educated men of his day, and had a degree of Doctor of Divinity conferred upon him by the University of Heidelberg, Germany.\nBetween 1838 and 1857 the little church built a modest brick structure, and received from one of its deceased members $10,000, the income of which is still divided between the church and worthy colored students.\nSteadily the church has grown until today it has a large, brick edifice, a pipe organ and a chapel, and has just celebrated its ninety-fourth anniversary. It has always been foremost in public movements; in helping the Underground Railway; in seconding the efforts of William Lloyd Garrison; in encouraging education, and now in various lines of social uplift. A course of lectures is maintained; industrial classes are carried on, and a gymnasium teacher is hired; the Boy Scout movement has a center here; a pure milk station is in its chapel; and a social survey of the neighborhood was recently made.\nThe present pastor is the Rev. Edward F. Goin, a graduate of Yale.\nSt. John’s A.M.E. Church of Norfolk, Va., was organized about 1840, and first met in an old soap factory. Then the white Methodist church took care of the congregation, and gave them their first house of worship in 1848. In 1863, under the Military Government, the church secured colored trustees, and after the war was admitted to the A.M.E. church through Bishop Wayman.\nFrom the first the church has had a hard struggle with debt. The present edifice, which is the third that the church has owned, was begun in 1888. A fine parsonage was added in 1907, and finally in August, 1915, the church stood free from debt with an unusually excellent plant.\nPerhaps the pastor, the Rev. E.H. Hunter, is proudest of his Sunday School among all the branches of his work. This is one of the great Sunday Schools of the country with an enrollment of nine hundred in the main school, three hundred and fifty in the Home Department, and one hundred and twenty-five in the Cradle Roll, a total of 1,375. There are thirty-two classes in the main school, and twenty-six classes in the Home Department, each in charge of a visitor.\nThe Cradle Roll Department is one of the brightest features of the school. The superintendent has a committee of four women and twelve girls who serve as visitors. The singing is spirited, and assisted by an orchestra of twenty men, and a choir of thirty boys and girls. There are classes in sewing and basketry work; lawn tennis, basket ball and other sports are encouraged, and a company of fifty cadets, uniformed and equipped.\nThe Superintendent is Lieutenant James N. Collins, who is serving his twenty-fourth term.\nSt. Mark’s M.E. Church, of New York City, dates from 1871, and first worshipped at Broadway between Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth Streets. In 1871 it removed to West Thirty-fifth Street; in 1882 to West Forty-eighth Street, and in 1895 to West Fifty-third Street, where it now remains.\nThe pastor. Dr. William H. Brooks, who has served since 1896, is an organizer of unusual ability. Not only does the church own its edifice, but in 1900 it purchased a parsonage for $8,000; in 1911 an apartment house in Harlem for $54,000, and in 1913 a dwelling in New Rochelle for $6,000. This same year a house adjoining the church was bought and reconstructed as a Parish House at a cost of $63,000. Negro architects, contractors and mechanics worked on it. There are about forty rooms for the various activities of the society, including a men’s club room, shower bath, gymnasium, kitchen, rest and play rooms, and an assembly hall for moving pictures. On the second floor is the pastor’s residence. All sorts of organizations have their headquarters here, and many books by and about Negroes have been collected. A day nursery is maintained, and fifteen of the church classes meet here regularly.\nBranches of St. Mark’s Church have grown up in Brooklyn, in Harlem, in the Bronx and in Williamsbridge, and despite this the Mother church has grown from a membership of eight hundred to nearly two thousand in eighteen years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Methodist Church, North (1911)\nJesus Christ in Baltimore (1911)\nThe White Church (1917)\nThe Church and the Negro (1913)\nThe Church (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Three Churches.” The Crisis\n11 (6): 312–13. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/11/06/three_churches.html."

    "text": "Most Americans having secured the right to vote, the principle of free public schools, the right to trial by jury and the right to travel without insult are proceeding to use these foundation rights for the purpose of accomplishing economic freedom, more effective education, the abolition of crime and like reforms. Among such liberal and radical thinkers any reference to the right to vote, the abolition of lynching or admission to the public schools sounds archaic. It brings to them no recognition of the fact that these demands should be part of a radical program because their own program for white people has swept so far beyond these initial demands that these demands are no longer “radical”—they are almost reactionary.\nIf, therefore, you speak to the ordinary liberal minded white man of helping to secure to the Negro the right to vote, he immediately begins to discourse upon the inefficacy of voting among whites and the disappointment of the democratic movement which began with the right to vote. If you ask him to help stop lynching he inquires if lynching really does take place. He is then inclined to think that it must be very sporadic and at any rate he adds that there are many worse things in the modern industrial organization than lynching. If you are interested in securing elementary rights to common school education for black children you are reminded of the wretched school system in the city of New York; and if you wish to abolish the daily insult of “Jim Crow” cars you are talking about something that your auditor has never seen and cannot conceive of. And yet conceive the language of such a man if his vote were taken away, his children excluded from school and his wife compelled to travel in a smoking car!\nThus in a country where a tenth of the population has most of its voters illegally deprived of any voice in their government, where each week for forty years at least one of their fellows accused of crime has been lynched without semblance of a trial, where no schools at all are provided for a majority of the group’s children, where no attempt is made to deal out even ordinary and primitive justice in the courts or in jail to large numbers of the group, and where discrimination in every walk of life is for them the ordinary rule,—in such a country you can have a program of public minded radicals which does not in any way touch a single one of these wrongs except possibly by indirect inference,\nThe point which such radicals forget is that the oppression of the Negro in the United States is not simply the misfortune of the Negro. Even if that were not true surely the right of twelve million black people would call for at least as much space as 250,000 Indians. But the case is worse than this. Political cheating in the United States is directly traceable to cheating Negro voters in the South. The impossibility of securing a clear popular verdict in the United States on any question is directly chargeable to the rotten borough system of the Southern states. Education with us has been twisted out of its proper channels very largely because of the necessity of using it as a vehicle of propaganda against “inferior” races. There is no sense in a peace program which takes no account of the world wide economic war upon colored peoples. The insult to Japanese, Jews and southern Europeans in the pending immigration bill is a logical deduction from the American past-time of Negro-baiting. It is absolutely certain that the future of liberal and radical thought in the United States is going to be made easy or impossible by the way in which American democracy treats American Negroes. Under these circumstances it seems to me impossible for any group of Radicals to write down any program which will in the slightest degree convince the world of its sincerity without touching the plight of American Negroes.\nA simple statement that one of their objects is the “political, social and economic emancipation of the Negro” would meet the issue; or they could go into further detail.\nThe main needs of the colored people in their struggle for emancipation fall under these heads:\n\nThe education of the children and the discovery and encouragement of talent.\nEmployment without color discrimination on the part of employers or on the part of trade unions.\nThe right to vote and hold office\nThe abolition of civil discrimination in the administration of the law and in courts of justice and especially in matters of racial lynching and travel.\nThe rebuttal of persistent propaganda on the inferiority of certain races especially the Negro race.\n\nIt is not always easy to say just how these various needs and disabilities can be met, but most of them call for:\n\n\nInvestigation\n\nPublicity and agitation\n\nAn appeal to the courts and the legislatures\n\nIt is astonishing that Radicals are not always eager and determined to put into their program planks covering these matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRadicals (1919)\nEducation (1911)\nEducation (1930)\nPublic Schools (1916)\nPublic Schools (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1925. “Radicals and the Negro.”\nThe Crisis 29 (5): 199–200. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/29/05/radicals_and_the_negro.html."

    "text": "There was a man standing in the Wilderness. He was black and thin; his clothes were shabby but his eyes burned toward heaven.\nThen was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.\nO wide was the wilderness and tangled — dark and full of sounds and silences. He could not understand it — he could not see it — he could not. It was full of beasts, of ugly thoughts, of awful memories. In his hand he was holding a book — he was filled with the Word of God — yet the Word was silence to him. He was twenty years young and the Wilderness stretched from his High Hill of Graduation down yonder to the low gates where one might see the Valley of the Shadow of Death.\nAnd when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered.\nAnd when the tempter came to him he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\nBread? Bread and butter! Yes, he must earn it. The days of the years of his childhood were past. He must turn stones into bread — not into great cathedrals, into tall temples, into bridges that fly from cloud to cloud — but bread, bread alone — but Life, Joy, the Right to think and do and be. And then the vision came — work and home and wife and child — one woman — young and beautiful; in silk and jewels; with fingers as soft as her voice. He smiled at the devil wanly:\nBut he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\nTen years with slow and stately tread pass by. The black man grows and his work grows. The half-filled, ever hungry soul unmarried. The devil is a long, lean man, tailored and groomed:\nAnd the devil, taking him up into a high mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.\nAnd the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.\nIf thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.\nThe Kingdoms of the world! The glory of them; like a thread of silver Piccadilly melts into the Strand; like a thread of gold, the Champs Elysées slip to the Bois; Broadway thunders through its canons; the Prado burns and sings. Above them tower Milan, Woolworth, Taj Mahal, Alhambra and the Opera. North is pine and ice and fur; west is orange and gold; east is oak and silver; south is palm and sea and fire. All amidst them are jewels and silk, color and curve, music and dance, dream and tale, knowledge and cunning. Ah, the Kingdoms of the World.\nAnd suddenly the glory faded. And suddenly all was dirt and pain and blood; and hate and horror. Which was God and who and what and why? The devil spread his hands. “I am God” he said.\nAnd Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan:\nThen the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple.\nAnd saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee; and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.\nThe black man was forty and older and thinner. He stared into the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Was he really one of the sons of God? Did his father’s angels have charge over him?\nMiracles? Were not they the answer? Must not God himself and his angels come more quickly to earth, to settle this awful problem of color and race? How simple. Sow to work. Call God. Come down as a mighty prophet, revealing seer, sacrificing saviour. And yet—was it fair to call a busy God, to tempt him from His own work? Perhaps he too was being crucified? He stared at the devil. The devil was a priest in robe and mitre chanting long prayers.\nJesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCurtains of Pain (1917)\nThe Gospel According to Mary Brown (1919)\nEaster-Emancipation 1863-1913 (1913)\nFor What (1919)\nThe Story of Africa (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1924. “The Temptation in the Wilderness.”\nThe Crisis 291 (29): 58. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/29/02/temptation.html."

    "text": "Much mist and misunderstanding has been consciously and unconsciously put in the colored public mind by recent discussions of the schools. We colored people must, however, keep one thing clearly before us: the first fours years’ of a child’s life, no matter what his race or condition, must be devoted by every modern country which wishes to survive and grow to a very simple program of study: (1) The child must learn to read so as to be able easily to understand what men have written; (2) the child must learn to write so as to be able to communicate with his fellow men; (3) the child must learn to count so as to be able to handle the extraordinary multiplicity of the world’s things. To read, to write, to cipher—this is the program and the only program of the first four years of a child’s school life. The neglect to do this work then means, in practically all cases, the fatal crippling of the child. This program of study is a matter of technique and difficult technique. It must be learned early and thoroughly or it may not be learned at all. It must be carefully drilled in and be made second nature to the child.\nWhenever any person, country or age seeks to substitute for this work anything else, they are either themselves deceived or deliberately deceiving. Other things may appear in the program of the primary school but they are simply subsidiary to the main program and designed to make the main program more easily acquired. Play, for instance, is there as a matter of health and recreation; moral habits are always to be indirectly acquired in home and in school, but the technical business of the primary school is to teach the child to read, to write and to cipher.\nNo vocational training has any place in a primary school. Any attempt to turn the primary school into a place for teaching trades or teaching agriculture or teaching housework as such is absolutely wrong and should be fought bitterly by everyone of democracy and human uplift. This does not mean that for recreation or as discipline little children may not sew and wash dishes and cultivate school gardens, but this work must not be vocational—it must be simply a means of interesting the child in this main work of learning to read, to write and to cipher.\nThe next four years of grammar grades are also mainly the carrying out of the work of the first four years, teaching the child to read for information as well as exercise; to write for self-expression as well as for mere communication; and to reason more clearly with mathematical correctness. It may be necessary at some times and places that a child from ten to fourteen be compelled to take some vocational work for self-support, but no country as rich as the United States or as enlightened can afford to make this necessary. It is becoming more and more fixed in our national thought that it is the business of a nation to educate a child up to fourteen years, that is through the grammar grades; and in addition to the three R’s and the geography, history and language study that go with them we should add nothing to the curriculum which is not primarily for the helping of these students in this main work either directly or indirectly through inciting interest and correct habits of health and application.\nAfter fourteen there comes an entirely different question—whether the child is to be trained directly for self-supporting work, as most children should be, or whether his talents are sufficient for him to be trained to greater service by longer methods of education."

It is needless to say that it indicates nothing of the sort. This Association and this magazine stand today exactly where they have stood during the eight years of their work; viz., for the full manhood rights of the American Negro.\nThe July editorial is not in the slightest degree inconsistent with these principles. It was submitted to prominent members and officers of the board before printing and found no objection.\nThe editorial seeks to say that the first duty of an American is to win the war and that to this all else is subsidiary. It declares that whatever personal and group grievances interfere with this mighty duty must wait.\nIt does not say that these grievances are not grievances, or that the temporary setting aside of wrongs makes them right. But it does say and Crisis repeats the word, that any man or race that seeks to turn his country’s tragic predicament to his own personal gain is fatally cheating himself.\nWhat Crisis said is precisely what in practice the Negroes of America have already done during the war and have been advised to do by every responsible editor and leader.\nThe editorial was in exact accord and almost in the very words of a resolution written by the same hand and passed unanimously by the thirty-one editors of all the leading Negro publications in America.\nDid Negroes refuse to serve in the draft until they got the right to vote? No, they stormed the gates of the army for the right to fight. Did they refuse commissions because their army school was segregated? No, they were eager to enter and diligent to learn. Have we black men for one moment hesitated to do our full duty in this war because we thought the country was not doing its full duty to us? Is there a single Negro leader who advised by word, written or spoken, rebellion and disloyalty? Certainly not.

They say it is all well to be idealistic, but is it not true that while we have fought our country’s battles for one hundred fifty years, we have not gained our rights? There is just enough fact in this half truth to make it a whole and a very mischievous lie. No, we have not gained all our rights, but we have gained rights and gained them rapidly and effectively by our loyalty in time of trial.\nFive thousand Negroes fought in the Revolution; the result was the emancipation of slaves in the North and the abolition of the African slave trade. At least three thousand Negro soldiers and sailors fought in the War of 1812; the result was the enfranchisement of the Negro in many Northern States and the beginning of a strong movement for general emancipation. Two hundred thousand Negroes enlisted in the Civil War, and the result was the emancipation of four million slaves, and the enfranchisement of the black man. Some ten thousand Negroes fought in the Spanish-American War, and in the twenty years ensuing since that war, despite many set backs, we have doubled our landholding acreage and quadrupled our accumulated wealth. We have established a strong leadership of education and character, we have expanded our business interests and we have established the N.A.A.C.P., with forty thousand members.\nGod knows we have enough left to fight for, but any people who by loyalty and patriotism have gained what we have in four wars ought surely to have sense enough to give that same loyalty and patriotism a chance to win in the fifth.\nAnd we are winning right now.

Attention has been called this year especially to the child and the United States Government has been spreading widely the gospel of the preservation of child life. The death of some ten million men who would have been fathers of unborn children has made the world think of the horrors of peace as well as the horrors of war. And the greatest of the horrors of peace is the unnecessary and persistent slaughter of little children. It is a crime of every civilization and of every race, but we Negroes are among the guiltiest, among us from two hundred to five hundred of every thousand of our babies born die before they reach one year of age. We have pleaded poverty, prejudice and slavery as excuse, but the time is come not to excuse but to combat with our own available weapons this murder.\nThe remedy is, first, care and forethought in bringing children into the world and, second, pure food and air for them when they come. We persist in keeping windows shut and living indoors; we persist in buying food carelessly and feeding all kinds of food indiscriminately to children.

    "text": "Within the Negro race we are continually scoring ourselves for lack of unity and we are holding up other races and other groups as splendid examples of perfect agreement. We forget in this criticism one thing: the basis of all advance and development is Diversity; the characteristic of stagnation and death is Unity. Any attempt in a growing organism to make all of its factors act alike, is simply and definitely to stop growth.\nOn the other hand, without doubt, diversity, difference, the struggle of ideas and ideals means lost motion and personal bickering; but some minimum of this is absolutely essential in the present situation of the Negro race. There must be among both white people and colored, grave and deep differences of opinion as to method and end with regard to black folk in America.\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People represents one point of view. It represents it sincerely and definitely. It believes that either the Negro will become a full fledged American citizen the equal of every other citizen in legal rights, political power, civil opportunity and social recognition—that either this will happen or democracy in America will die and democracy in the world receive a mortal blow. It believes passionately that the attempt to arrange this world in a hierarchy of races with the so-called\n“Nordics” dominating and subordinating the mass of men, is the most outrageous and foolhardy program that thoughtful people can be a party to. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People recognizes that, compared with the attitude of the bourbon South, its program is revolutionary; that compared with what the best and forward looking elements of the South are willing to concede, this program is radical and exceeds their will and wish. In addition to this our association knows that there are many honest colored people who believe that we will never get our rights by the sort of agitation and fighting which this association and the Crisis carries on, but that submission to evil, catering to the best white South and in general “laying low” is the only way for us to achieve even partial freedom.\nUnder such circumstances to talk unity and agreement is nonsense. If the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is right, these other people are wrong. If one group is walking North and the ether group walking South, or even if they are nearer in points of compass but nevertheless going in different directions, for them to unite will be for one or both of them to give up their deepest and most cherished beliefs. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People therefore seeks and desires union only with those who believe in its program and are willing to fight with it for its consummation. Such people together with others who are willing to listen to its arguments it invites to its great Philadelphia meeting this day and this year.\nCome and hear the story of the development of democracy in the United States and the way in which a handful of men united in 1909, have become a mighty host in 1924 and are unswervingly determined to go forward to the great ideal of American democracy despite color, sex and race; an association which “will not equivocate, will not excuse and will be heard.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Strength of Segregation (1913)\nCorrespondence (1926)\nPan-Africa and New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Race Segregation (1934)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1924. “Unity.” The Crisis 28 (3):\n103–4. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/28/03/unity.html."

For many years your organizations have made public profession of your interest in Negro labor, of your desire to have it unionized, and of your hatred of the black “scab.”\nNotwithstanding this apparent surface agreement, Negro labor in the main is outside the ranks of organized labor, and the reason is first, that white union labor does not want black labor and secondly, black labor has ceased to beg admittance to union ranks because of its increasing value and efficiency outside the unions. We thus face a crisis in interracial labor conditions; the continued and determined race prejudice of white labor, together with the limitation of immigration, is giving black labor tremendous advantage. The Negro is entering the ranks of semi-skilled and skilled labor and he is entering mainly as a “scab.” He broke the great steel strike. He will soon be in a position to break any strike when he can gain economic advantage for himself.\nOn the other hand, intelligent Negroes know full well that a blow at organized labor is a blow at all labor; that black labor today profits by the blood and sweat of labor leaders in the past who have fought oppression and monopoly by organization. If there is built up in America a great black bloc of non-union laborers who have a right to hate unions, all laborers, black and white, eventually must suffer.\nIs it not time, then, that black and white labor get together? Is it not time for white unions to stop bluffing and for black laborers to stop cutting off their noses to spite their faces?\nWe, therefore, propose that there be formed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Federation of Labor, the Railway Brotherhoods and any other bodies agreed upon, an Interracial Labor Commission.\nWe propose that this Commission undertake:\n\nTo find out the exact attitude and practice of national labor bodies and local unions toward Negroes and of Negro labor toward unions.\nTo organize systematic propaganda against racial discrimination on the basis of these facts at the labor meetings, in local assemblies and in local unions.\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People stands ready to take part in such a movement and hereby invites the coöperation of all organized labor. The Association hereby solemnly warns American laborers that unless some such step as this is taken and taken soon the position gained by organized labor in this country is threatened with irreparable loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro and Labor (1922)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nThe A.F. of L.

    "text": "A number of newspapers anxious to get in line for campaign funds have been throwing fits over the alleged endorsing of a Third Party by this Association. What the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in annual conference actually said was printed in the plainest sort of English in the last Crisis. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People does not attempt to tell its members or anyone else how to vote. It does attempt to put the facts before them and to urge them to consider the facts and vote with their brains and not with their prejudices. It has said repeatedly and says again: Any black man who votes for the present Republican party out of gratitude or with any hope that it will do a single thing for the Negro that it is not forced to do, is a born fool. Equally no Negro democrat can for a moment forget that his party depends primarily on the lynching, mobbing, disfranchising South. Toward any Third Party advocates the intelligent Negro must be receptive, hoping they are not enemies, seeking to make them friends, and trying to balance the prospects oi good and ill in supporting them.\nFacing such facts one Negro may decide to support Coolidge in the present campaign, not because he is so good but because others are so bad; another Negro considering the same facts may decide to support Davis because in his Negro attitude he represents the best of a bad crowd; or again a black man may well say: “LaFollette’s industrial program will help me as a laborer more than his silence on the Negro problem hurts me.”\nAll of these positions are understandable and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has on its Board of Directors and in its executive office persons who represent every one of these attitudes and we still co-operate and respect each other’s reasons and decisions.\nBut some things we do not understand and bitterly resent: One is the old “Jim Crow,” “Grand Old Party” jackass who brays every time the black man criticizes the mass of privilege, monopoly and condescension which now masquerades as the party of Abraham Lincoln.\nAnother is the gentleman who accuses everybody who differs with him of being a scoundrel. In every campaign the attempt of self-respecting Negroes to vote as men and not as puppets is met with a flood of filth and abuse from certain Negro newspapers which are either paid to support the Republicans or expect to be paid. Unless we overwhelm these venal editors by our discountenance and contempt we will but weld our political slavery on our children.\nThe base of our trouble is that still, to a large number of prominent Negroes, “politics” is simply a method of private gain. They sell their votes, their opinions, their influence; and they think that this is what voting means. They did not originate this sordid business, God knows, but they have proven apt scholars and even some of our new women voters from whom we expected so much are joining in the hunt for loot and bribes, for pay and petty place.\nWhat we need in this campaign is non-partisan centers of discussion and information; debate, facts, statements and re-statements of the high function of the voter and the deep eternal significance of Democracy.\nLet us in God’s name vote next November with our heads and not with our heels, as freemen and not as slaves, for racial and human uplift and not for contributions from the party slush fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro Party (1916)\nMuddle (1916)\nWhite Co-Workers (1920)\nThe Negro in Politics (1929)\nThe Election (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1924. “The N.A.A.C.P.

    "text": "We colored folk stand at the parting of ways, and we must take counsel. The objection to segregation and “Jim-Crowism” was in other days the fact that compelling Ne­groes to associate only with Negroes meant to exclude them from contact with the best culture of the day. How could we learn manners or get knowledge if the heritage of the past was locked away from us?\nGradually, however, conditions have changed. Culture is no longer the monopoly of the white nor is pov­ erty and ignorance the sole heritage of the black. Many a colored man in our day called to conference with his own and rather dreading the con­ tact with uncultivated people even though they were of his own blood has been astonished and deeply grati­fied at the kind of people he has met—at the evidence of good manners and thoughtfulness among his own.\nThis together with the natural human love of herding like with like has in the last decade set up a tre­ mendous current within the colored race against any contact with whites that can be avoided. They have wel­comed separate racial institutions.\nThey have voluntarily segregated themselves and asked for more seg­regation. The North is full of in­ stances of practically colored schools which colored people have demanded and, of course, the colored church and social organization of every sort are ubiquitous.\nToday both these wings of opinion are getting suspicious of each other and there are plenty of whites to help the feeling along. Whites and Blacks ask the Negro who fights separation: “Are you ashamed of your race?” Blacks and Whites ask the Negro who welcomes and encourages separation: “Do you want to give up your rights? Do you acknowledge your inferi­ority?”\nNeither attitude is correct. Segregation is impolitic, because it is impossible. You can not build up a logical scheme of a self-sufficing, sep­arate Negro America inside America or a Negro world with no close rela­tions to the white world. If there are relations between races they must be based on the knowledge and sym­pathy that come alone from the long and intimate human contact of indi­viduals.\nOn the other hand, if the Negro is to develop his own power and gifts; if he is not only to fight prejudices and oppression successfully, but also to unite for ideals higher than the world has realized in art and indus­try and social life, then he must unite and work with Negroes and build a new and great Negro ethos.\nHere, then, we face the curious paradox and we remember contradictory facts. Unless we had fought segregation with determination, our whole race would have been pushed into an ill-lighted, unpaved, un-sewered ghetto. Unless we had built great church organizations and manned our own southern schools, we should be shepherdless sheep. Unless we had welcomed the segregation of Fort Des Moines, we would have had no officers in the National Army. Unless we had beaten open the doors of northern universities, we would have had no men fit to be officers.\nHere is a dilemma calling for thought and forbearance. Not every builder of racial co-operation and solidarity is a “Jim-Crow” advocate, a hater of white folk. Not every Negro who fights prejudice and segregation is ashamed of his race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Tragedy of ‘Jim Crow’ (1923)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nCorrespondence (1926)\nThe “Jim Crow” Argument (1913)\nSeparation (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “Jim Crow.” The Crisis 17\n(3): 112–13. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/17/03/jim_crow.html."

    "text": "Europe had begun to look with covetous eyes toward Africa as early as 1415 when the Portuguese at the Battle of Ceuta gained a foothold in Morocco. Thereafter Prince Henry of Portugal instituted the series of explorations which resulted not only in the discovery of Cape Verde, the Guinea Coast and the Cape of Good Hope, but by 1487 gave to Portugal the possession of a very fair slice of the African East Coast. This was the beginning of the Portuguese Colonies of Guinea, Angola and East Africa. Other European nations, France, Holland, Spain, England and Denmark, followed and set up trading stations along the African coast whose chief reason for existence was the fostering of the slave trade.\nBut the partition of Africa as we know it is much more recent and begins with the founding in 1884 of the Congo Free State whose inception was so zealously fostered by Leopold of Belgium and which in 1908 was annexed to Belgium. The “scramble” for African colonies was on and within a quarter of a century Africa was virtually in the hands of Europe.\nIn this division the British Empire gained a network of possessions extending from the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan down to South Africa with valuable holdings on the East Coast and in Somaliland. France came next with an actually larger area, but with a smaller population. Her spoils reached from Morocco and Algeria, including the Algerian Sahara, to the French Congo, and on the Eastern Coast comprised Madagascar and French Somaliland. Germany, who was late in entering the game of colonization, contrived none the less to become mistress of four very valuable colonies, Togoland, Kamerun, South-West Africa and East Africa. Italy’s and Spain’s possessions were relatively unimportant, embracing for the former, Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, and for the latter Rio de Oro and the Muni River settlements.\nThis was the state of affairs when the war broke out in 1914. In Africa the only independent states were the Republic of Liberia, and the kingdom of Abyssinia which, according to history, has been independent since the days of Menelek, the reputed Son of Solomon, and the Queen of Sheba. The number of souls thus under the rule of aliens is astounding, amounting in the case of England, France, Germany and Belgium to more than 110,000,000. During the course of the war Germany lost all four of her African colonies with a population estimated at 138,420,000. It is the question of the reapportionment of this vast number of human beings which has started the Pan-African movement. Colored America is indeed involved.\n\n“If we do not feel the chain\nWhen it works another’s pain,\nAre we not base slaves indeed,\nSlaves unworthy to be freed?“\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHelping Africa (1924)\nPan-Africa (1921)\nKenya (1924)\nReconstruction and Africa (1919)\nLeague of Nations (1927)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “Africa.” The Crisis 17 (4):\n164–65. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/17/04/africa.html."

He leaves the Senate in 1919, at the special request of President Wilson, on account of his disloyalty,—not simply to his party leader and his country, but to the foundation principles of democratic government.\nHe said in helping to defeat Woman’s Suffrage:\n\nWhat will be the result, when tens of thousands, yes, hundreds of thousands, of Negroes come home from this war with a record of honorable military service? I can conceive that a new agitation may arise as strong and bitter as the agitation for Negro suffrage which swept the North after the Civil war. I can see that this agitation will have a strong basis of right to the minds of people who do not understand the white man’s burden as it is borne in the South.\n\nThat the number of people who are no longer willing to view with understanding minds the present suffrage conditions in the South will diminish and dwindle away is the chief and compelling reason back of the loyalty of the Negro race in the war.

    "text": "This is the month of elections. The colored people have long had the habit of considering that the so-called “off-year” in elections is of little importance, and that the important thing is the Presidential election. No greater mistake could well be made. One might almost say that in normal times it makes no difference who is President of the United States, but it makes every difference to every single American who is his Alderman, who is Mayor, who is his member of the Legislature, and his Governor, and above all, who is his Congressman. Let every colored man and woman who can vote see to it that they know the records of the persons who are candidates for these local offices and that they vote for no man who is not demonstrably and unequivocally loyal to the Government and loyal to the rights of American citizens of Negro descent. For instance: the Second Congressional District of New York, covering the large Negro populations of Flushing and Jamaica, is represented in Congress by Charles Pope Caldwell. Mr. Caldwell was born in Texas. When a delegation of colored women, including the widow of a former United States Senator, the wife of a United States Consul in France, and the wife of a Municipal Judge, asked for a hearing before a congressional committee in order to urge the appointment of Negro officers in the army, this man Caldwell “contemptuously threw down their cards; which he had been holding in his hand, and emphatically said he would never vote for a colored man to be an officer;” whereupon he angrily turned upon his heel and strode away. It does not make an iota of difference what party Caldwell represents, he must be defeated.\nOn the other hand, in New York State colored voters have to choose between Whitman and Smith. Both of them have excellent records so far as the colored people are concerned, and a choice calls for thoughtful consideration along lines outside of racial matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Election (1910)\nPolitics (1912)\nThe Woman Voter (1921)\nThe Negro Party (1916)\nPresidential Candidates (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “The Colored Voter.”\nThe Crisis 17 (1): 8–9. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/17/01/colored_voter.html."

    "text": "To the People of the United States:\nThis is an appeal not for any privilege, indulgence or preference of any kind, but for simple justice.\nFor many years the people of the Southern States have claimed that they understand better than any one else what they call the “Negro problem,” and have insisted that they must be allowed to deal with the colored people in their communities as they think best. The same claim was made during the days of slavery, and the rest of the country, largely from indolence and the wish for a quiet life, weakly yielded and closed its eyes and ears to the horrors of slavery. To save themselves trouble the people of the United States allowed this iniquity to live and grow powerful, until four years of civil war brought upon them many times the trouble which they had tried to avoid during the years which preceded it.\nDetermined to root out for all time the injustice which had been punished by such a terrible penalty and after “every drop of blood drawn by the lash” had been “paid by another drawn by the sword,” the people of the United States, so far as the Constitution could do it, secured to every citizen of the country his equal rights before the law. For the first time since the Declaration of Independence was published its “self-evident truths” were recognized in practice, and a new day seemed to have dawned on this republic.\nUnwarned by the experience of our fathers we are now repeating their folly. We acquiesce while the colored people of this country, entitled equally with ourselves to every legal right, are oppressed, insulted and degraded. Instead of opening wide the door of opportunity and offering them encouragement and help in their attempt to climb from slavery to independent manhood, instead of trying to make them a body of useful, intelligent citizens, we ignore our responsibility for their condition and put every obstacle in their way, permitting men whose views are warped by the traditions and prejudices of slavery to dictate our policy.\nWhat are the consequences? If our colored fellow-citizens wish to cast their votes they are met by every legal and illegal obstacle, and in large sections of the country the colored vote is suppressed. Not only can they not vote for what they want, but their white neighbors cast the votes of the colored men for what the colored men do not want. As they count in the basis of representation and yet are denied the ballot, they are not only not represented but they are misrepresented, and the power of those who would perpetuate injustice is doubled.\nThe Southern leaders say that the Negroes are ignorant and degraded, but they will not give them the education that they need. It is notorious that the schools provided for the colored children are far worse than those enjoyed by the whites in large sections of the country, and it is also true that the path of those who would teach them is beset with difficulties and often serious dangers. In Florida no white man is allowed to teach in a colored school, and the supply of competent teachers is therefore largely reduced. The spokesmen of the South openly avow their purpose to keep their colored neighbors ignorant and fitted only for employment as laborers.\nIf Negroes would acquire property and make themselves useful citizens, they find in one place an agitation to prevent their buying farms, in others violent attempts by nightriders and like ruffians to drive them from the farms which they have bought, and to prevent their laboring in the fields. Segregation ordinances are proposed in many cities to restrict their places of residence, and this movement derives support from the action of the Federal Government which undertakes in the public offices, the property of us all, to separate white from colored in the service of the United States, deliberately changing conditions which have continued without objection for fifty years.\nIf Negroes are suspected of crime their lives may be taken by mob violence without trial, and the men who murder them, nay more, torture them with barbaric cruelty, whether in Springfield, Illinois, in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, or in countless southern towns and villages, go absolutely unpunished though perfectly well known, while their action is approved by the communities where these cruelties are committed.\nIf colored men or women acquire an education, positions are denied them because they are colored. Banks and offices will not receive them. If they would travel, hotels and restaurants are closed to them, and public corporations offer them grossly unfit accommodations.\nLaws are proposed to control their marriage with white persons though intercourse between the races has always prevailed, and the result of such laws must be to put colored women at the mercy of white men, and to deprive them of the very slight protection which the law now gives them, while a generation of innocent children is degraded and stigmatized. Many labor unions will not admit them, nor let them work as non-union men.\nIn Miami, Florida, a Negro chauffeur who presumes to drive his master’s car from Palm Beach is nearly killed by a mob of white chauffeurs. The theatres admit plays grossly misrepresenting colored folk and appealing to race prejudice and passion. Public parks and places of amusement are largely closed to them. In Northern schools and colleges they are often unwelcome. At every turn and in every attempt to rise they are met by this wicked prejudice. The man in whose veins flows only a trace of Negro blood, who inherits from his white ancestors their ambitions and their tastes, is treated as if he were hopelessly degraded, and all over the country the attempt is made to hold them down as an inferior class, denied those equal rights and equal opportunities which are the birthright of every American citizen.\nThis state of things is absolutely intolerable and it cannot continue without bringing upon this country the most serious calamities. No community can treat any considerable body of citizens unjustly without suffering the consequences. The attempt of the French Government to hold Dreyfus in undeserved imprisonment nearly overthrew the republic.\nThe problem before this country is not a Negro problem only but far more a white man’s problem. We all suffer, white and colored alike, and as there are more white, so they suffer more while the present conditions continue. It is time for all who believe in justice and humanity to organize and to resist race prejudice wherever it lifts its head.\nWe appeal to the people of the South who profess to be civilized and Christian, and ask how long they will allow their fair name to be blackened and degraded by unpunished lynching, and the attempt to keep the Negroes down. While it continues the Southern states cannot rank among civilized communities. Are they content to hold this position?\nWe appeal to the Christian church and ask where in the teachings of its Founder it finds any warrant for treating human beings with cruelty and injustice.\nWe appeal to the lawyers whose mission it is to enforce the law and secure to everyone his just rights, and ask them if they are content to see lynch law take the place of proper judicial procedure.\nWe appeal to the judges who hold the scales of justice, and urge them to keep the balance true between men, no matter what their race or color.\nWe appeal to the colleges and schools whose teachers so largely control the future of this country not to deny education to any one who seeks it.\nWe appeal to every warm-hearted, high-minded man or woman in this country, and urge them to organize a new anti-slavery movement. We beg them by voice, vote and example to rouse their neighbors and to make our public men feel that their political careers are not to be advanced by yielding to the advocates of discrimination. We must organize our political, our religious, our educational, nay all our forces to the end that our country may be relieved from the influence of all who believe that they help themselves up by keeping others down. Our motto is “All men up” and that spirit must conquer, or terrible disaster awaits the country which we all love.\n\nCitation: Storey, Moorfield. 1915. “An Open Letter.” The Crisis. 10(2):132–133, 136.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro and the Land (1914)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nLight (1912)\nLetters (1919)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMoorfield, Storey. 1915. “An Open Letter.”\nThe Crisis 10 (2): 132–33, 136. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/10/03/an_open_letter.html."

    "text": "In 1913 and since there have been several celebrations of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. The Emancipation Proclamation, however, only proclaimed freedom in parts of the United States and it did not make the institution of slavery illegal. The Thirteenth Amendment was the legal end of American slavery. This Amendment passed Congress January 31, 1865, and became a part of the Constitution December 18, 1865.\nIt is fitting that the jubilee of this great landmark in human culture be celebrated, and celebrated in Washington by the descendants of the chief beneficiaries of its provisions.\nThe celebration, too, should be unique and make a wide appeal. The ordinary “exposition” idea with assembled exhibits has not only been overworked but done so extraordinarily well at Paris, Chicago and St. Louis that no small effort however commendable can be aught but disappointing.\nThe Pageant, that new and rising form of art expression, seems especially fitted for such a celebration as this. A pageant is not a tableau or playlet or float. It is a great historical folk festival, staged and conducted by experts with all the devices of modern theatrical presentation and with the added touch of reality given by numbers, space and fidelity to historical truth.\nThe great pageants of England and those at Philadelphia, Boston and St. Louis in America are well known. Only one pageant has been attempted by American Negroes. This formed the chief feature of the Emancipation Celebration of the State of New York and repeatedly drew crowds beyond the capacity of the large armory.\nMany requests have been made for a repetition of this pageant but this seemed impracticable. However, a partnership has finally been formed to be known as the Horizon Guild, under the presidency of Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois. The Horizon Guild, which will eventually be incorporated, proposes to present pageants of Negro history in the principal centers of Negro population during the next decade. It is hoped in this way to form a sound basis for the dignified celebration of the adoption ot the Fourteenth Amendment in 1916, the Ter-Centennary of the Landing of the Negro in 1919 and the Jubilee of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1920.\nThe Guild is not a money making venture but a philanthropy on business principles whose small initial capital has been contributed by persons interested in the development of Negro dramatic art in America. Furthermore, the Guild is entirely an independent venture with a single object and unconnected with any other organization.\nDuring the week of October tenth the Horizon Guild will present in Washington, D.C., a pageant “The Jewel of Ethiopia” portraying the history of the Negro race for 5,000 years. The pageant will be given under the auspices of a local committee of one hundred citizens and will use one thousand participants chosen from among the colored inhabitants of the district. The pageant will be given in the open air. The musical setting will consist of fifty-three pieces of Negro music by Negro composers; the costumes will be historically accurate and the scenery and properties will be simple but imposing. Altogether this will be the greatest dramatic event ever attempted by colored Americans and it will fitly celebrate the great Amendment which declared that “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude … shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.”\nPersons interested in the work of the Horizon Guild may communicate with the Editor of The Crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEmancipation (1913)\nThe Fourteenth Amendment (1915)\nAn Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson (1913)\nThirteen (1918)\nCivil Rights (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “A Pageant.” The Crisis 10\n(5): 230–31. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/10/05/pageant.html."

    "text": "Several years ago a “professional southerner” named Dixon wrote a sensational and melodramatic novel which has been widely read. Eight years ago Dixon brought out his novel as a sordid and lurid melodrama. In several cities the performance of this play was prohibited because of its indecency or incitement to riot. Recently this vicious play has been put into moving pictures. With great adroitness the real play is preceded by a number of marvelously good war pictures; then in the second part comes the real “Clansman” with the Negro represented either as an ignorant fool, a vicious rapist, a venal and unscrupulous politician or a faithful but doddering idiot. By curious procedure this film received the preliminary approval of the National Board of Censors. It was put on in Los Angeles and immediately the fine organization of the N.A.A.C.P. was manifest. The facts were telegraphed to us from our Los Angeles Branch. We started at the Board of Censors. The proprietors of the film fought madly but the Censors met, viewed the film and immediately withdrew their sanction. Many of them were astonished that any committee of their board had ever passed it. The owners of the film promised to modify it but the modifications were unimportant. Yet this remarkable Board of Censors met a third time and passed the film over the protests of a minority of nine persons. Among these nine, however, was the chairman and founder of the board, Frederick C. Howe, Commissioner of Immigration at the Port of New York and several others equally influential. In other words, the board of censorship is now practically split in two. The Association was not discouraged but immediately took steps on the one hand to bring the matter into court and on the other hand to interview the mayor.The interview with the mayor was after some difficulty arranged. The delegation of five hundred of the most prominent white and colored people in the city filled the Council Chamber at City Hall and for an hour in terse, tense speeches urged the mayor to act. The mayor promised to have the two rape scenes cut out immediately and to go further than this if the play still seemed objectionable from the point of view of public peace and decency.\nThis action while commendable is not sufficient. The whole second half of the play ought to be suppressed and the Association will continue to work to this end. It is gratifying to know that in this work we have the cordial co-operation of all elements of colored people. The New York Age and the Crisis worked hand in hand with Harlem, Brooklyn and Jersey City. We know no factions in the righting of this great wrong.\nIt is sufficient to add that the main incident in the “Clansman” turns on a thinly veiled charge that Thaddeus Stephens, the great abolition statesman, was induced to give the Negroes the right to vote and secretly rejoice in Lincoln’s assassination because of his infatuation for a mulatto mistress. Small wonder that a man who can thus brutally falsify history has never been able to do a single piece of literary work that has brought the slightest attention, except when he seeks to capitalize burning race antagonisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRadicals (1919)\nA Statement (1919)\nTillman (1918)\nCrime (1920)\nCourts and Jails (1932)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “The Clansman.” The Crisis\n10 (1): 33. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/10/01/clansman.html."

    "text": "The Macon, Georgia, Daily Telegraph, a widely-read white publication, has often done The Crisis the honor of quoting and criticizing its words. Some of these remarks we have from time to time reprinted, but they have hardly seemed to call for an answer. Usually they answered themselves. Last September, however, the Telegraph published a leading editorial, a column and a half long, which illustrates so well the deliberate misunderstanding of the aspirations of the Negro by the White South that it deserves a reply.\nThe Telegraph asserts in brief, first, that The Crisis is responsible for the present racial unrest in the South and that if “a really serious race clash” should break out there that “the blood will be on its head.” Secondly, that “Du Bois hates white men, because they are white and he is black” and that our fight against “segregation, Jim-Crowism, and division of the races” proves this. Thirdly, that the South wants the Negro to practice economy, thrift, and the steady acquisition of property and “will do everything to help and further that development,” while The Crisis wants “social equality.” Fourthly, that The Crisis deliberately plays up “the one-tenth of one per cent. of trouble” in the South and “ignores the ninety-nine and nine-tenths of continued and growing organization on a better basis for both races.” Fifthly, that Negro schools in the South are supported by white men’s taxes, while The Crisis is complaining because the schools are not mixed. Sixthly, that “the black man lived for uncounted centuries in Africa on his own resources and never so much as improved the make-up of an arrow, coined a new word, or crept an inch nearer to a spiritual religion.” And, finally, that Dr. Moton should start a new magazine at Tuskegee to tell the world “and tell all the Negroes about how well things are going on or can be made to go between the races.”\nWe quote this extraordinary indictment at length because while the editor of the Telegraph cannot possibly believe it true, thousands of his white readers do; and millions of other white Southerners hold similar beliefs.\nNow, therefore, to our answers. First, The Crisis is not responsible for the present unrest among Negroes. That unrest is caused by disfranchisement, lynching, “Jim-Crow” cars, and wide-spread and continuous injustice of southern whites toward blacks. The Crisis is responsible for spreading the knowledge of this crime and injustice and urging Negroes and whites to protest against it. Secondly, opposition to segregation in homes, travel, and work does not show that Negroes are ashamed of their color and race. It merely shows that they have sense enough to know that if their homes are confined to the Negro quarter, they will get no sewerage or police protection, no paving or lights, and that white prostitutes will be openly housed next to their schools and churches, as was the case in Macon. It shows that Negroes object to paying first-class fares for third-class railway accommodations, and that starvation wages result from a color line in work and ability. Thirdly, there is no doubt but that large numbers of white Southerners see a solution of the race problem in the upbuilding of a thrifty, contented, homeowning peasantry. But they are not willing to pay the price, and that price is Law and Order, Justice in the courts, decent schools, and mutual self-respect; instead of this, the South over large areas and in numberless cases caters to the mob, has a double standard of justice, provides wretched schools or none at all, and drives out self-respecting and law-abiding Negroes, who will not cheerfully submit to insult. Fourthly, The Crisis does not consciously exaggerate southern conditions. The editor has lived fifteen years in the South, has visited every Southern State, and has made painstaking studies into social conditions. It is true, and it ought to be true, that if among ten men, a murder occurs, those who would better human life say more about the one dead man than about the nine living. This because the murder rate of one in ten is too high for a civilized community. So, too, when The Crisis attacks lynching, it does not forget that of the 1,200,000 Negroes in Georgia, in 1918, only nineteen were lynched. But The Crisis remembers that a single human being illegally done to death by a mob in any state is an indictment of government so severe as to call for protest and agitation. It is perfectly true that most white Southerners are not lynchers, but it is just as true that most of them will not consent to the one step which will stop lynching—punishment of lynchers. So, too, while peace and prosperity rule wide regions of the South and kindly and helpful race relations exist, yet it is also true that the amount of racial friction and unrest, the human hatred and insult, the poverty, the fighting, murder and maiming, the crime, sorrow, and despair, reach a height which makes the problem of race relations in the South the most portentous social problem in the United States. Fifthly, it is untrue that Negro schools are supported by white taxes in the South. This is a blatant falsehood which has been disproven again and again. Charles L. Coon, a southern white school superintendent, found in 1909, that Negroes in eleven Southern States, forming over 40% of the school population, got less than 15% of the school fund, and in the state of Georgia he proves that $647,582 of the school fund of 1907 was due Negroes as their share of direct and indirect taxes, while only $506,170 was spent on their schools, and he concludes that the southern white man cannot maintain that he is supporting Negro schools. Sixthly, as to Africa and the Negro, we appeal from the Anthropology of Macon to that of Dr. Franz Boas, a professor of Anthropology in Columbia University, who says:\n\nAn unbiased estimate of the anthropological evidence so far brought forward does not permit us to countenance the belief in a racial inferiority which would unfit an individual of the Negro race to take his part in modern civilization. We do not know of any demand made on the human body or mind in modern life that anatomical or ethnological evidence would prove to be beyond the powers of the Negro.\n\nBoaz adds:\n\nIt seems likely that at a time when the European was still satisfied with rude stone tools, the African had invented or adopted the art of smelting iron.\n\nA volume in the Home University Library says:\n\nThat Negro peoples were the beginners of civilization along the Ganges, the Euphrates, and the Nile, seems proven. Early Babylon was founded by a Negroid race.\nThe Assyrians show a distinct Negroid strain, and early Egypt was predominately Negro.\n\nFinally, we would welcome a monthly edited by R. R. Moton on the lines suggested by the Telegraph. But we opine that it would omit the semiannual report of lynchings, which Tuskegee sends out to the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLight (1912)\nRadicals (1919)\nSouthern Papers (1911)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nThe Name Negro (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “The Macon Telegraph.”\nThe Crisis 19 (3): 109–10. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/19/03/macon_telegraph.html."

    "text": "The migration of Negroes from South to North continues and ought to continue. The North is no paradise—as East St. Louis, Washington, Chicago, and Omaha prove; but the South is at best a system of caste and insult and at worst a Hell. With ghastly and persistent regularity, the lynching of Negroes in the South continues—every year, every month, every day; wholesale murders and riots have taken place at Norfolk, Longview, Arkansas, Knoxville, and 24 other places in a single year. The outbreaks in the North have been fiercer, but they have quickly been curbed; no attempt has been made to saddle the whole blame on Negroes; and the cities where riots have taken place are today safer and better for Negroes than ever before.\nIn the South, on the other hand, the outbreaks occurring daily but reveal the seething cauldron beneath—the unbending determination of the whites to subject and rule the blacks, to yield no single inch of their determination to keep Negroes as near slavery as possible.\nThere are, to be sure, Voices in the South—wise Voices and_ troubled Consciences; souls that see the utter futility and impossibility of the southern program of race relations in work and travel and human intercourse. But these voices are impotent. Behold, Brough of Arkansas. He was an original leader of the most nromising recent group which sought Sense and Justice in the race problem—“The University Commission on Southern Race Questions.” He said, as chairman:\n\nAs an American citizen the Negro is entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and the equal protection of our laws for the safeguarding of these inalienable rights. … None but the most prejudiced Negro-hater, who oftentimes goes to the extreme of denying that any black man can have a white soul, would controvert the proposition that in the administration of quasi-public utilities and courts of justice the Negro is entitled to the fair and equal protection of the law. … The meanest Negro on a southern plantation is entitled to the same consideration in the administration of justice as the proudest scion of a cultured cavalier.\n\nYet when he ran for Governor of Arkansas, he vehemently denied and explained away his liberal Negro sentiments,—and when the “uprising” occurred in Phillips. County, he let the slave barons make their own investigation, murder the innocent, and railroad ignorant, honest laborers to imprisonment and death in droves; contrast this with the actions of Governor Lowden of Illinois and Mayor Smith of Omaha!\nOn the other hand, we win through the ballot. We can vote in the North. We can hold office in the North. As workers in northern establishments, we are getting good wages, decent treatment, healthful homes and schools for our children. Can we hesitate? Come North! Not in a rush—not as aimless wanderers, but after quiet investigation and careful location. The demand for Negro labor is endless. Immigration is still cut off and a despicable and indefensible drive against all foreigners is shutting the gates of opportunity to the outcasts and victims of Europe. Very good. We will make America pay for her Injustice to us and to the poor foreigner by pouring into the open doors of mine and factory in increasing numbers.\nTroubles will ensue with white unions and householders, but remember that the chief source of these troubles is rooted in the South; a million Southerners live in the North. These are the ones who by open and secret propaganda fomented trouble in these northern centers and are still at it. They have tried desperately to make trouble in Indianapolis, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York City.\nThis is a danger, but we have learned how to meet it by unwavering self-defense and by the ballot.\nMeantime, if the South really wants the Negro and wants him at his best, it can have him permanently, on these terms and no others: 1. The right to vote. 2. The abolition of lynching. 3. Justice in the courts. 4. The abolition of “Jim-Crow” cars. 5. A complete system of education, free and compulsory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Newer South (1926)\nThe Migration (1917)\nThe Migration of Negroes (1917)\nMemphis or East St. Louis?

At a public meeting they lauded the whites and their enterprise to the skies, but complained to the government agents of the “burden” of the Negro—the black half of their population, said one pompous orator, was a “liability and not an asset.”\n“Well,” replied an unimaginative northern Colonel, who wanted ships built instead of talk, “if it wasn’t for this liability, you wouldn’t have gotten this ship-yard!”\nThe fundamental error of the white South thus shown is seen in the assumption that ALL property is WHITE property; that they benevolently “give” Negroes work; that they let them walk THEIR streets and “pay for” their schools.\nIn economic thought the South is 100 years behind the civilized world.

    "text": "At the time of the Chicago riots, Medill McCormack, United States Congressman from Illinois, was reported as follows in an interview:\n\nThousands of these colored boys came to Chicago from the South. They were used to being handled without concern down there, and when they came to Chicago, they had a kind of an idea that they could sit in your lap, or do anything they pleased.\n \nI can best define the situation here by an instance that happened in Washington, the other day. A colored boy, carrying a package under his arm, got into the elevator, where we were followed by a white woman. The men have a habit of taking off their hats in an elevator when women enter.\n \nAll took off their hats, but the Negro. I said to him, “Why don’t you take off your hat?” He said, “I don’t have to, do I?” I told him, “No, you don’t have to, but that is the custom of the city.” He said, “Well, there is no law against it. Is there?” I told him there was no law against it.\n \nAs we got off the elevator, a southern gentleman said: “That’s the way with darkies that come from the North now. Unless they are compelled to comply with customs, they will not do so.”\n \nAnd that is about the situation here. And I am afraid that this will spread all over the country. It looks very serious.\n\nIn other words, bad manners or bumptiousness or excessive egotism on the part of a young colored boy, is serious enough to lead to murder, riot, and social upheaval. While, on the other hand, the treating of that same colored boy “without concern down South,” is a matter of no concern up North. Here lies the very meat of the Negro problem.\nMoreover, there is another and more subtle thing that must be considered. Whether it played a part in this case or not, one cannot know. If colored men are polite to white women, their efforts are easily liable to the most outrageous misconstruction. Rather, then, than appear to want in the slightest degree to approach white women, they adopt an attitude, not only indifferent, but hostile. It is because of this, that many colored men do not give their seats to white women in street cars and studiously avoid the little courtesies which would be their natural reaction. Too many of them have at some time been rewarded for such efforts by a stare, an insulting word, or even a blow from some passer-by.\nEven worse may happen: In Roanoke, Va., a black boy and a white girl were crossing a bridge, in opposite directions. Just as the girl was opposite the boy, she slipped and fell. The boy stretched out his hand to help her. He was promptly lynched by a mob, despite the vehement protest of the white State’s Attorney. American white women are, in numbers of cases, used to treating Negroes publicly as the dirt beneath their feet. Very well, says the Negro, courtesy is not expected of dirt. We are not defending this attitude; we are merely explaining it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Matter of Manners (1933)\nPoliteness (1911)\nPrecept and Practice (1910)\nSeparation (1911)\nBooze (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “A Matter of Manners.”\nThe Crisis 19 (4): 170. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/19/04/matter-of-manners.html."

Some few are the efforts of individuals who use the magic word coöperation for stores in which there is not a trace of the coöperation principle.\nThere are a dozen or more which are largely coöperative, but not entirely—for instance, they have shares, and the number which one man may own is limited. The shareholders are obliged to buy a certain minimum amount of goods before they can share in the profits.\nThis is only partially coöperative. Full coöperation requires: cheap shares, of which anyone can own any number; but there is no temptation to own large numbers of shares, because profits are divided according to the amount the person buys.\nWhy, now, do beginners hesitate to make this last provision? Because having stirred up the people by the argument of race loyalty and opened the store, they say: “Why should I surrender the coming profits to a mass of people whom the driblets will not greatly benefit? Why not keep them and grow rich!”\nHesitate, brother, hesitate, right there! Remember that with the present chain grocery store and trust system, your individual grocery has a small chance to succeed, because the Trust can and will undersell you.\nBut with the true coöperative principle, your clientele is nailed down. Your shareholders are pledged by their own interests to trade with you, and to trade often and much. The more they spend the more they make. Your business is no guesswork. You know just how much to buy. If the chain store cuts prices below cost, your people will buy of you at the higher price, because they know that the low price is a temporary trick for which they themselves will eventually pay. Whatever happens, you cannot fail as long as your shareholders are true, and they will be true as long as they share in the profits according to their purchases.\nDon’t be afraid.

    "text": "We are not for a moment denying the existence of a criminal class among Negroes, who are guilty of deeds of violence. Every race in the world has such groups. No human efforts have yet been able wholly to rid society of crime. But if of all groups, the American Negro is to be singled out and punished as a group for the detestable deeds of its criminals, then this country is staging a race war of the bitterest kind, when the wronged and the innocent fight in desperate defense against the mob and murderer.\nThere is a curious assumption in some quarters that intelligent and law-abiding Negroes like, encourage, and sympathize with Negro crime and defend Negro criminals. They do not. They suffer more from the crime of their fellows than white folk suffer, not only vicariously, but directly; the black criminal knows that he can prey on his own people with the least danger of punishment, because they control no police or courts.\nBut what can Negroes do to decrease crime? Some white Southerners have but one suggestion, which is that when a Negro is accused of crime, other Negroes turn to run him down and hand him over to the authorities.\nBut hold! Is there no difference between a person accused of crime and a criminal? Are black folks accused of crime in the South assured of a fair trial and just punishment? We will let a white southern ex-Confederate, Bishop B. J. Keiley, of Georgia, answer in the Savannah Press:\n\nIs it not the fact that fair and impartial justice is not meted out to white and colored men alike? The courts of this state either set the example, or follow the example set them, and they make a great distinction between the white and the black criminal brought before them. The latter, as a rule, gets the full limit of the law. Do you ever hear of a street difficulty in which a Negro and a white man were involved which was brought before a judge, in which, no matter what were the real facts of the case, the Negro did not get the worst of it?\n\nThis is bad enough, but this is not all. We have criminals who deserve punishment. Now the modern treatment of crime and criminals, is built on carefully considered principles: one, old as the English Common Law, and older, declares that it is better for the community that ten guilty men should escape, rather. than that one innocent man should be punished; moreover, it is beginning to be widely recognized that in crime, the criminal is not the only one guilty; you and I share in the guilt if we have not given him as a child an education, furnished him with a place to play, and seen that his body was nourished; we are guilty if as a man he was not allowed to do honest work, did not receive a living wage, and did not have proper social environment.\nThis social responsibility for crime is so widely recognized that when the criminal is arrested, the first desire of decent modern society is to reform him, and not to avenge itself on him. Penal servitude is being recognized only as it protects society and improves the criminal, and not because it makes him suffer as his victim suffered.\nWhat, now, is the attitude of the white South toward Negro crime? First and foremost, it would rather that ten innocent Negroes suffer than that one guilty one escape; secondly, it furnishes Negro children, for the most part, wretched schools and no playgrounds; it usually pays the adult low wages, houses him in slums, and gives him neither care nor thought, until he steals or murders. It has few juvenile reformatories, and herds all kinds of criminals together, selling them into slavery to the highest bidder, under the “Lease” system. Its idea of punishment is vengeance—vengeance of the cruelest and most blood-curdling sort.\nUnder such circumstances, what can an honest Negro do to stop Negro crime?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCourts and Jails (1932)\nThe Old Story (1911)\nTriumph (1911)\nMob Tactics (1927)\nLogic (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “Crime.” The Crisis 19 (4):\n172–73. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/19/04/crime.html."

The company to which they applied, following the usual custom of life insurance companies, secured a confidential report from a leading white bureau of investigation.

Beneath him lay a Turkish rug, and behind him, through the window, one saw his steel mills, minting millions.\n“Yes,” he said; “I recognize the new power of the Negro in Industry. He broke the steel strike for us!”\nMy heart stopped. Merciful God! It is to this, we have come. I saw the squalor and toil and endless hours of the stricken workman. I saw him sink beneath the murk, while at his throat were the hands of my people!\nThen to my heart the blood came surging back. Why were these rivals wallowing in the swill and offal of the Steel Barons? Was the work so lovely and the pay so high? No; but because black peonage of the South is worse than the foreign white slavery of the North; because the black worker has small choice: to be lynched, to work for nothing in Georgia and Arkansas, or to be a scab in Pennsylvania. It’s better to be a scab. But who forced on the black man this choice? Two men,—the White Worker and the Steel Baron. The white worker, when he said in the South, “You shan’t vote,” and when he said in the North, “You shan’t join my Union! Or, if you do join, you’re still a nigger, and I’m white.”\nIn part, then, the guilt lies with the worker; but only in part, and, perhaps, when we think of ignorance and poverty,—in smaller part. The deeper, bloodier, guilt lies with those Masters of Industry, who today, yesterday, and tomorrow, plan to make the petty, human jealousies, hatreds, rivalries, and starvations of workingmen, the foundation of their colossal fortunes. They are the breeders-of mobs and lynchings, of unrest and despair, of race war and class struggle. They stand above the squabble, like ringmasters cracking their whips, and at every writhing coil of the long snakelike lash, some white man mobs a nigger,” and some black man takes the bread from the white man’s mouth. Thus, in vicious, unending circle, the hate and harm rise, mount, and spread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nThe Black Man and Labor (1925)\nTriumph (1911)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nPrecept and Practice (1910)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “Dives, Mob, and Scab.”\nThe Crisis 19 (5): 235–36. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/19/05/dives.html."

    "text": "Two criticisms have been made of the editorial on England in the January number of The Crisis. One writer reminds us of the great work of emancipation and the suppression of the slave trade, started by England early in the nineteenth century. The other, would not have us forget the hostile attitude of Irish Americans toward Negroes.\nOf none of these facts are we a moment forgetful. In the Emancipation of Negroes, Englishmen, like Clarkson, Wilberforce, and Sharpe, were splendid pioneers; and the riots against Negroes in Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and New York, during the nineteenth century, in nearly all cases, were instigated and led by Irishmen. More than this: Today, the decisive influence in the American Catholic Church, which keeps black priests out of her pulpits, is the Irish influence,—for the mother Catholic Church is not, and never was, anti-Negro. Her black priests and bishops have for a thousand years sat in her counsels, and the first Catholic bishop of North America, was a full-blooded Negro.\nAgain,—it was liberal, far-sighted Englishmen who gave to the world the democratic parliamentary ideal, which all rares and colors receive today as civilization’s rightful heritage.\nNevertheless, two things are sure: One cannot indict a whole nation, nor can one excuse a national wrong, because of individual right, or past desert.\nIreland today deserves freedom. She has suffered, and suffered horribly at the hands of Englishmen. In Ireland and Russia, have arisen the greatest spiritual movements of the twentieth century. And we who suffer in slavery and degradation,—shall we hesitate to extend a hand of sympathy to the Irish, simply because their descendants in America are so largely the followers of American snobbery? We must not forget that Irish-Americans, like John Boyle O’Reilly and Archbishop John Ireland, and Irishmen like Daniel O’Connell, have always recognized Negroes as fellow-men.\nThe great services of England to the world and to the Negro race must not for a moment blind us to the fact that today the dominant powers in England are moving heaven and hell to keep black and brown men in economic and political slavery, to minister to British power and luxury.\nLet us cite just one instance:\nIt has been proven by English testimony, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that Sir Starr Jameson, who died November 26, 1917, was a liar and a thief. The British Aborigines Protection Society says:\n\nOn August 14, 1893, Dr. Starr Jameson signed a Secret Agreement, under which he promised to each man who would assist him in making war upon the Matabele, the right to take from the Matabele 6,000 acres of their land (conditionally redeemable by the Company, paying £9,000 to each raider.) Some 600 men volunteered on these terms, and thus the total land agreed to be taken from the Matabele, before any Chartered Company’s Official entered the country, was over 3,000,000 acres.\n \nBut though war was strongly desired, though every preparation was made locally, the difficulty lay with the Imperial Government, who, represented by the High Commissioner, Sir H.B. Loch, for a time refused to allow the invasion of Matabeleland. It was clear that something must be devised to force the hand of the Imperial Government. What is known as the “Victoria Incident” then took place.\n \nA Mashona Chief was alleged to have cut some telegraph wire. This chief was in charge of cattle belonging to Lobengula. The Company, it was alleged, seized these cattle as part punishment, knowing them to be Lobengula’s property. Lobengula sent an impi, “to punish the Mashonas for cattle thefts and for damaging the telegraph wires.” This was an act (as Lobengula maintained) of positive friendliness to Dr. Jameson, who had insisted on something being done to “protect” the telegraph wire. The Matabele Impi attacked (July 9) the Mashonas, near Victoria, the headquarters of Dr. Jameson, and killed, it is said, twenty (some say seven, but none saw even that number) Mashonas. Dr. Starr Jameson then ordered the Matabele to leave Mashonaland; they started to return. Thirty-eight Chartered Company men followed, and without (as is officially admitted) any provocation, shot nine to eleven Matabele, including the Chief.\n \nSome days later, Dr. Jameson sent a telegram to the High Commissioner, which included the false statement that the Matabele had fired on the Company’s white men—an allegation which the Imperial Authorities only ascertained to have been without a shred of foundation after the Matabele had been “smashed.” Sir Henry Loch had, naturally, taken a grave view of this alleged action. Accepting Dr. Jameson’s ex parte statement, he telegraphed to Lobengula, and thus admonished him:  \n“When the conduct of your indunas and people became dangerous, not only to the property, but to the lives of the white men, and they dared to fire on the white men then the limits of patience were passed.”\n \nWar on the Matabele followed this false statement to the High Commissioner, and a general scramble for their best lands at once ensued. The neighboring Mashonas were robbed of their land, by the simple process of declaring that the Mashonas were at the same time subjects of the Matabele (which they were not), and, therefore, what the Matabele lost, the Mashonas lost, although it is interesting to note that the Company recruited Mashonas to assist in the invasion of Matabeleland.\n\nWhat happened to Mr. Jameson? He was knighted by Great Britain; he became Prime Minister of Cape Colony; he died rich and respected. His Majesty George V “deplored the loss of one who has rendered such great service to the empire.”\nThis is one incident, but it is an incident of terrible warning to black men. We have a right to suspect a land that honors the thief of 90 million acres. We have a right to ask: Where is liberal England? Where are the spiritual sons of William Wilberforce?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nIreland (1916)\nViolence (1934)\nBleeding Ireland (1921)\nThe Crisis (1910)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “England, Again.” The Crisis\n19 (5): 237–38. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/19/05/england_again.html."

Hill, a farmer, was one of the chief organizers, and the Union was incorporated under state law. When the trouble occurred in Phillips County, a thousand Negroes were arrested, over twenty-five murdered, twelve sentenced to death, and scores to the penitentiary. Among the victims were four of the most prominent professional colored men in Helena.\nHill was accused of “instigating” this riot. He fled, protesting his innocence. Recently he was arrested in Kansas.

    "text": "The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States has never been enforced thoroughly. This means that involuntary servitude is still wide spread in the southern United States. There are even vestiges of the slave trade in the convict lease system and the arrangements for trading tenants. On the whole, how ever, the slavery that remains is a wide spread system of debt peonage and a map of the farms operated by colored tenants shows approximately the extent of this peonage.\nThe Arkansas riot originated in the attempt of the black peons of the so-called Delta region, (that is the lowlands between Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana) to raise their income. The center, Phillips County, Ark., has 692,000 square miles of land and its chief city is Helena. In 1910 there were 33,535 inhabitants in the country, of whom 26,354 or 78.6% were Negroes. The county is predominately a farming community with $9,000,000 worth of farm property, and two-thirds of the value of all the crops is represented by the cotton crop. Of the 9,835 males of voting age, 7,479 are Negroes, and of these 5,510 could read and write; nevertheless, all the political power is in the hands of the 4,000 white voters, Negroes having no representation even on juries.\nThe Negroes are the cotton raisers. Of the 30,000 bales of cotton raised in 1909, they raised 25,000. Most of the Negro farmers are tenants. In the whole county there were, in 1910, 587 colored owners and 1,598 colored tenants. These tenants farmed 81,000 acres of land and raised 21,000 bales of cotton. For the most part the method of dealing with these tenants is described by a local reporter, as follows:\nAll the white plantation owners had a system whereby the Negro tenants and sharecroppers are “furnished” their supplies. They get all their food, clothing, and supplies from the “commissary” or store operated by the planter, or else they get them from some store designated by him. The commissary or store charges from twenty-five to fifty per cent. interest on the value of the money and supplies advanced or furnished. If any one doubts this statement, let him ask any planter or storekeeper. As a whole, they admit it. They boast that the commissary is the safest and best paying department of the plantation.\nA northern white man bought a big farm in Mississippi. Of course, he had a “commissary.” When the season was over, he complained that he had made but little money. His southern neighbors asked him questions as to his methods etc., and found that he had charged the cost price for his supplies and had added ten per cent. for profit, and had settled with his hands at the actual market value of the cotton at the time it was sold. They said, “Hell, man, you haven’t got the right system. You don’t make money down here on your cotton except in good years. You make your money off your commissary. Besides, never give your niggers a statement of their accounts. If you do, you will ruin every nigger in the country. Just tell them what they’ve got coming and pay them off and don’t let ’em argue or ask any questions.”\nThat is only part of the “system.” The landlord takes the cotton, gins it, sells it at the highest market price, and settles with his tenants at the lowest market price for their “share” of the crop. They play both ends against the middle and get the Negro going and coming. If a Negro objects, he is classed as “an insolent nigger” or a “bad nigger.” He is beaten by the “agent” or “boss man” and either driven off the place, or else he admits he is wrong, becomes thoroughly cowed, and then is allowed to remain.\nSeveral years ago the United States Government started to investigate alleged peonage among Italian laborers in the South. To their surprise and chagrin they ran across very little Italian peonage, but a great deal of Negro peonage. In Phillips County a white lawyer, named Bratton, prosecuted a number of cases for the government and convicted a half-dozen planters.\nRecently the price of cotton has, as you know, greatly increased. It was about nine cents a pound in 1904, eleven cents in 1915, twenty cents in 1916, and twenty-eight cents in 1917. The price at present is forty cents. This rise in price has made it difficult to keep the Negroes in debt, and, therefore, they have become restive in their demands for itemized settlements.\nThat was the situation in 1918. Many Negroes had their cotton taken by the planter in October, 1918, but did not get a settlement until July, 1919. They had never been able to get a statement of their accounts from month to month, hence when July came, how could a man dispute an account made the year before? How could he say that he did not get certain supplies in June, 1918, when he did not know until July, 1919, what he was charged with?\nThe Negroes got tired of it. Sixty-eight of them got together and decided to hire a lawyer and get statements of their accounts and a settlement at the right figures. They decided not to hire a Negro lawyer, because they knew that it meant mobbing and death to any Negro lawyer who would have the presumption to take one of these white planters to court. They were afraid to trust any white lawyer in Phillips County for fear their attorney would lay down on them and fail to get results after getting their money. They canvassed the situation and found that the firm of Bratton and Bratton, white, of Little Rock, was a good, reliable firm, and would fight for a Negro client to the last. They made contracts with this firm to handle all the sixty-eight cases at fifty dollars each in cash and a percentage of the moneys collected from the white planters. Also some of these Negroes and their friends planned to go before the Federal Grand Jury and charge certain white planters with peonage. These men had meetings from time to time for the purpose of collecting the moneys which were to be paid in advance and to place the same in the treasury; also to collect evidence and gather facts which would enable them to successfully prosecute these cases. These meetings had to be secret to prevent harm and danger to the men concerned and to their families.\n\nThe “Black Belt”\nHere four million Negroes live and at least 500,000 of these are still held in involuntary servitude, in defiance of the 13th Amendment.\nMeanwhile another organization sprang up. The Negro cotton pickers organized a union to raise the wages of cotton-pickers and refused to pick cotton until they received higher wages for their work. These meetings were secret. Also, at Elaine were a great many Negroes who worked in the saw-mills and who received fair wages, and who refused to allow their wives and daughters to pick cotton or to work for a white man at any price. They did this as a measure of protection to their wives and daughters, who were subject to the advances and insults of white men on the cotton farms.\nAll these movements became known to the white planters and they resolved to break up the whole business and put the Negroes “in their place.” It is the unwritten law of the cotton planter that his Negro tenants “must not take the boss man to law.” Woe be unto the “insolent nigger” who attempts it. The white men also learned that Negroes were buying guns and plenty of ammunition. The merchants at Helena reported large sales and the express offices also reported shipments of rifles and shell to Negroes. The Negroes had read and heard all about the East St. Louis, Washington, and Chicago riots, and knew of the secret Ku Klux Klan movements among the white people in the South. They knew that race hatred on the part of white people was increasing by leaps and bounds and that riots were liable to break out in that section at any time. They were simply preparing to defend their homes and lives, for experience had taught them that Negroes have no protection at the hands of the law. The police and deputy sheriffs either refuse to check the mobs, or else they join hands with the mobs. The assembling of arms was for purely defensive purposes. No Negro was fool enough to think of an “insurrection” against white people.\nWhile the white men were meeting secretly and discussing means of “nipping the niggers in the bud,” matters came to a head very suddenly in an unexpected way. On Sunday, before the riot, John Clem, a white man, from Helena, came to Elaine loaded up and drunk on “white mule.” He proceeded to bully and terrorize the whole Negro population of over four hundred people by continuous gun play. The Negroes, to avoid trouble, got off the streets, and phoned to the sheriff at Helena. He failed to act. Monday, Clem was still on a rampage. The Negroes avoided trouble, because they feared that his acts were a part of a plan to start a race riot. Tuesday, some Negroes were holding a meeting in a church at Hoop Spur. A deputy sheriff and a “special agent,” white, and a Negro trusty came by in an auto. The white men stopped and proceeded to “investigate” the meeting. They were refused admittance. They attempted to break in and fired into the building. Some Negroes returned the fire, killing the special agent and wounding the deputy sheriff, so it is said. However, when the Negro trusty reported the shooting, he said that they had been fired upon from ambush by two white men and a Negro. The wounded deputy also first reported that the party had been fired upon from ambush by two white men and he was quite sure he saw a Negro running from the scene. Later all mention of the white men was carefully avoided and suppressed, and the entire blame was laid upon the Negroes at the church and it was charged that all of them were armed, that the white men were proceeding peaceably on the road and only got out to fix their car, which just happened to break down right in front of this particular church, and that the Negroes fired on them without any provocation whatever. Later another white man was fired on, and it was claimed that he just happened to be coming along the road an hour later and was shot by Negroes who were at the same church.\nIt never seemed for a moment unreasonable to the white men to believe that the Negroes would kill and wound white men at the church and then deliberately stay there for an hour or two longer for the purpose of killing another white man. Every sane man knows that those Negroes would have fled from the scene after the first shooting, if they had been guilty.\nAnyhow, the hue and cry was raised. “Negro uprising,” “Negro insurrection,” etc., was sent broadcast. The white planters called their gangs together and a big “nigger hunt” began. They rushed their women and children to Helena by auto and train. Train loads and auto loads of white men, armed to the teeth, came from Marianna and Forrest City, Ark., Memphis, Tenn., and Clarksdale, Miss. Rifles and ammunition were rushed in. The woods were scoured, Negro homes shot into, Negroes who did not know any trouble was brewing were shot and killed on the highways.\nTelegrams were sent to Governor Brough. He called for Federal troops and five hundred were rushed from Camp Pike, armed with rifles, cannon, gas masks hand grenades, bombs, and machine-guns. The Colonel took “charge of all strategic points,” and “mobilized his men to repel the attack of the black army.” The country was scoured for a radius of fifty to one hundred miles, covering all of Phillips and part of adjoining counties, for “Negro insurrectionists.”\n\nThe soldiers arrested over a thousand Negroes, men and women, and placed them in a “stockade” under heavy guard and kept them there under the most disgusting, unwholesome, and unsanitary conditions. They were not allowed to see friends or attorneys but all of them had to be separately and personally “investigated” by the army officers and a white “committee of seven.” Even after “investigation” had proven completely that a Negro was wholly innocent, still no Negro was released until after a white man had appeared and personally “vouched” for him as being a “good nigger.” The white man was usually a planter or employer and they refused to “vouch” for the Negroes until the Negroes had given assurance and “guarantees” as to work and wages. Finally, all but two or three hundred were released. All Negroes who owned their own farms or were otherwise independent, were held, as a rule, because no white man would vouch for them. In addition to those held by the soldiers, over three hundred were arrested and placed in the jail at Helena, charged with murder and rioting, and refused bond. They were not allowed to see friends or attorneys and were “investigated” by the “committee of seven.” This committee was secret at first. Its membership was not disclosed, but was organized and did its work with the direct sanction of Governor Brough.\nThe next day, after the first killing of the special agent, which occurred at Hoop Spur, 0. G. Bratton, a son of U. S. Bratton, arrived at Ratio. There he met many Negroes who had employed the firm of Bratton & Bratton to obtain their settlements. The Negroes represented the sixty-eight tenants on the Fairthy plantation. They had had no settlement of their 1918 cotton crop until July, 1919, and then no itemized account. Two carloads of their 1919 crop were about to be shipped without settlement and they determined to take the matter into court.\nAbout fifty of them began to pay the cash fees agreed upon. Many had no cash, so they offered him their Liberty Bonds, which he accepted. While collecting this money and giving receipts, a crowd of white men, who were engaged in the “nigger hunt,” came upon him. They arrested Bratton and all the Negroes with him and sent them to jail at Helena, where they were imprisoned on charges of “Murder,” and held without bond.\nBratton was on the train on his way to Ratio, which is twelve miles from Hoop Spur, and he and the Negro clients had not yet heard of the trouble when they met to close up the payment of the cash fees intended for his firm. All this time the white press of Arkansas kept up a hue and cry to the effect that Bratton was there “inciting an uprising of the Negroes and teaching them social equality.” The feeling was so bitter against young Bratton that there were grave threats and fears of his being lynched. The Governor ordered special guards sworn in, patrols were stationed about the jail, and only the utmost precautions prevented the lynching of a man who was not even a lawyer and whose only crime consisted in collecting fees for his father’s firm. It is now openly admitted that Bratton is clearly innocent of any part in the trouble, still he was held thirty-one days without bond in jail and then released without trial, because his father was about to obtain justice for Negro tenants.\nThe saddest and worst feature of the whole miserable slaughter of Negroes was the killing of the four Johnston brothers. They were sons of a prominent and able Negro Presbyterian minister, who is now dead. Their mother is a very prominent woman and was formerly a school teacher. Dr. D. A. E. Johnston was a successful dentist and owned a three-story building in Helena. One brother fought in France and was wounded and gassed in the battle of Chateau-Thierry. Dr. Louis Johnston was a prominent physician and lived in Oklahoma. He had come home on a visit.\nOn the day of the first trouble the four brothers had gone squirrel hunting early that morning and started for home in the evening, wholly ignorant of the trouble at Hoop Spur. While they were miles out in the woods hunting, word of the trouble reached Helena. A merchant told the deputy sheriffs and posse that he had sold some shells to the Johnstons a day or so before the trouble.\nA crowd of men in an auto went to hunt for the Johnstons. They met them returning from the hunt. These white men were supposed friends of the Johnstons. They told them of the trouble and a riot was in progress and that it would be dangerous for any Negro to be on the country roads, especially armed. The Johnstons told them they had just been hunting and had nothing but shot-guns and squirrel shot. They were advised by their friends to turn back and go home by a train that would pass a little station several miles down the road. They took this advice and went to the station to go by rail to Helena. They left their car with a friend, whom they told of the situation. They had bought their tickets and were on the train when up rolled a car with some deputies. They arrested three of the men and took them from the train. The fourth brother, from Oklahoma, also got off. The officers had with them a man named Lilly, a friend of another white man with whom Dentist Johnston had had trouble, the week before. When Dr. Johnston got off the train, the officers told him to go back. He refused, saying, “These men are my brothers. If you arrest them, I will go too.” Then the officers said, “Well, if you are one of the Johnston brothers, we want you, too.” They then arrested the Oklahoma man, whose only crime was that of being a brother to the other three.\nThe men were loaded into an auto and the car went back down the same road they had come over. After going a few miles, a crowd of white men appeared, led by the very “white friends” who had warned the Johnstons to take the train. They had telephoned or sent word to the officers as to where they could get the Johnstons. As the mob approached, Lilly and the officers began to get out of the auto. The Johnstons then saw that they had been led into a trap by their supposed “white friends.” They were handcuffed, but they tried to put up a fight. Just as Lilly was climbing out of the car, preparing to turn the helpless men over to the mob, Dr. Johnston, although shackled, managed to grab Lilly’s pistol from his hand and shot him. The officers and the mob then shot the men literally to pieces. They were sowed with bullets so much so that their faces had to be covered at the funeral, and parts of their bodies were in shreds. The noble mother had to endure the terrible ordeal of seeing four of her fine, promising sons buried in one grave.\nThe main results of the whole miserable business are as follows: five white men and between twenty-five and fifty Negroes were killed in the riots; the stench of dead bodies could be smelled two miles. One thousand Negroes were arrested and one hundred and twenty-two indicted. Evidence was gathered by a committee consisting of two planters, a cotton factor, a merchant, a banker, the sheriff of the county, and the Mayor of Helena. They are said to have used electric connections on the witness chair to scare the Negroes. Sixty-six men have been tried and convicted-twelve sentenced to death, and fifty-four to penitentiary terms. The trials averaged from five to ten minutes each; no witnesses for the defense were called; no Negroes were on the juries; no change of venue was asked.\nThe work of “cleaning up” our people is not yet finished. The Grand Jury is at work and hundreds are to be indicted on charges of murder, rioting, conspiracy, etc. White lawyers at Helena are preparing to reap a harvest of fat fees from Negroes against whom there is no evidence, but who have saved money and property and Liberty Bonds. The Negroes are to be stripped to the bone.\nThe Negroes in the Black Belt are much demoralized, discouraged, and depressed. Hundreds are preparing to leave. Many Negro leaders, who have stood by the white people and who have counseled their race to stay here, now have not a word to say and many of them are also preparing to wind up their affairs and get out of the South. Negroes here live in fear and terror, afraid even to discuss the situation except in whispers and to well-known friends.\nGovernor Brough has issued a statement to the public press that he intends to have the Defender and The Crisis suppressed. The Arkansas Gazette, white, has issued an editorial demanding that Negro leaders give their people “proper advice,” and warning them that their race is in danger of annihilation unless Negroes cease to be led by the lure of Liberty and equal political rights and also warning them that the freedom of the Negro from bad economic conditions is not to be obtained by the methods which were resorted to by the Negroes of Phillips County. Also any white man who fights, either in court or elsewhere, for the rights of the Negro is to be put in jail and suffer social and business ostracism from the white people of the South.\n\nThe Crucifixion at Omaha"

They boast that the commissary is the safest and best paying department of the plantation.\nA northern white man bought a big farm in Mississippi. Of course, he had a “commissary.” When the season was over, he complained that he had made but little money. His southern neighbors asked him questions as to his methods etc., and found that he had charged the cost price for his supplies and had added ten per cent. for profit, and had settled with his hands at the actual market value of the cotton at the time it was sold. They said, “Hell, man, you haven’t got the right system. You don’t make money down here on your cotton except in good years. You make your money off your commissary. Besides, never give your niggers a statement of their accounts. If you do, you will ruin every nigger in the country. Just tell them what they’ve got coming and pay them off and don’t let ’em argue or ask any questions.”\nThat is only part of the “system.” The landlord takes the cotton, gins it, sells it at the highest market price, and settles with his tenants at the lowest market price for their “share” of the crop. They play both ends against the middle and get the Negro going and coming. If a Negro objects, he is classed as “an insolent nigger” or a “bad nigger.” He is beaten by the “agent” or “boss man” and either driven off the place, or else he admits he is wrong, becomes thoroughly cowed, and then is allowed to remain.\nSeveral years ago the United States Government started to investigate alleged peonage among Italian laborers in the South. To their surprise and chagrin they ran across very little Italian peonage, but a great deal of Negro peonage. In Phillips County a white lawyer, named Bratton, prosecuted a number of cases for the government and convicted a half-dozen planters.\nRecently the price of cotton has, as you know, greatly increased. It was about nine cents a pound in 1904, eleven cents in 1915, twenty cents in 1916, and twenty-eight cents in 1917. The price at present is forty cents. This rise in price has made it difficult to keep the Negroes in debt, and, therefore, they have become restive in their demands for itemized settlements.\nThat was the situation in 1918. Many Negroes had their cotton taken by the planter in October, 1918, but did not get a settlement until July, 1919. They had never been able to get a statement of their accounts from month to month, hence when July came, how could a man dispute an account made the year before? How could he say that he did not get certain supplies in June, 1918, when he did not know until July, 1919, what he was charged with?\nThe Negroes got tired of it. Sixty-eight of them got together and decided to hire a lawyer and get statements of their accounts and a settlement at the right figures. They decided not to hire a Negro lawyer, because they knew that it meant mobbing and death to any Negro lawyer who would have the presumption to take one of these white planters to court. They were afraid to trust any white lawyer in Phillips County for fear their attorney would lay down on them and fail to get results after getting their money. They canvassed the situation and found that the firm of Bratton and Bratton, white, of Little Rock, was a good, reliable firm, and would fight for a Negro client to the last. They made contracts with this firm to handle all the sixty-eight cases at fifty dollars each in cash and a percentage of the moneys collected from the white planters. Also some of these Negroes and their friends planned to go before the Federal Grand Jury and charge certain white planters with peonage. These men had meetings from time to time for the purpose of collecting the moneys which were to be paid in advance and to place the same in the treasury; also to collect evidence and gather facts which would enable them to successfully prosecute these cases. These meetings had to be secret to prevent harm and danger to the men concerned and to their families.\n\nThe “Black Belt”\nHere four million Negroes live and at least 500,000 of these are still held in involuntary servitude, in defiance of the 13th Amendment.\nMeanwhile another organization sprang up. The Negro cotton pickers organized a union to raise the wages of cotton-pickers and refused to pick cotton until they received higher wages for their work. These meetings were secret. Also, at Elaine were a great many Negroes who worked in the saw-mills and who received fair wages, and who refused to allow their wives and daughters to pick cotton or to work for a white man at any price. They did this as a measure of protection to their wives and daughters, who were subject to the advances and insults of white men on the cotton farms.\nAll these movements became known to the white planters and they resolved to break up the whole business and put the Negroes “in their place.” It is the unwritten law of the cotton planter that his Negro tenants “must not take the boss man to law.” Woe be unto the “insolent nigger” who attempts it. The white men also learned that Negroes were buying guns and plenty of ammunition. The merchants at Helena reported large sales and the express offices also reported shipments of rifles and shell to Negroes. The Negroes had read and heard all about the East St. Louis, Washington, and Chicago riots, and knew of the secret Ku Klux Klan movements among the white people in the South. They knew that race hatred on the part of white people was increasing by leaps and bounds and that riots were liable to break out in that section at any time. They were simply preparing to defend their homes and lives, for experience had taught them that Negroes have no protection at the hands of the law. The police and deputy sheriffs either refuse to check the mobs, or else they join hands with the mobs. The assembling of arms was for purely defensive purposes. No Negro was fool enough to think of an “insurrection” against white people.\nWhile the white men were meeting secretly and discussing means of “nipping the niggers in the bud,” matters came to a head very suddenly in an unexpected way. On Sunday, before the riot, John Clem, a white man, from Helena, came to Elaine loaded up and drunk on “white mule.” He proceeded to bully and terrorize the whole Negro population of over four hundred people by continuous gun play. The Negroes, to avoid trouble, got off the streets, and phoned to the sheriff at Helena. He failed to act. Monday, Clem was still on a rampage. The Negroes avoided trouble, because they feared that his acts were a part of a plan to start a race riot. Tuesday, some Negroes were holding a meeting in a church at Hoop Spur. A deputy sheriff and a “special agent,” white, and a Negro trusty came by in an auto. The white men stopped and proceeded to “investigate” the meeting. They were refused admittance. They attempted to break in and fired into the building. Some Negroes returned the fire, killing the special agent and wounding the deputy sheriff, so it is said. However, when the Negro trusty reported the shooting, he said that they had been fired upon from ambush by two white men and a Negro. The wounded deputy also first reported that the party had been fired upon from ambush by two white men and he was quite sure he saw a Negro running from the scene. Later all mention of the white men was carefully avoided and suppressed, and the entire blame was laid upon the Negroes at the church and it was charged that all of them were armed, that the white men were proceeding peaceably on the road and only got out to fix their car, which just happened to break down right in front of this particular church, and that the Negroes fired on them without any provocation whatever. Later another white man was fired on, and it was claimed that he just happened to be coming along the road an hour later and was shot by Negroes who were at the same church.\nIt never seemed for a moment unreasonable to the white men to believe that the Negroes would kill and wound white men at the church and then deliberately stay there for an hour or two longer for the purpose of killing another white man. Every sane man knows that those Negroes would have fled from the scene after the first shooting, if they had been guilty.\nAnyhow, the hue and cry was raised. “Negro uprising,” “Negro insurrection,” etc., was sent broadcast. The white planters called their gangs together and a big “nigger hunt” began. They rushed their women and children to Helena by auto and train. Train loads and auto loads of white men, armed to the teeth, came from Marianna and Forrest City, Ark., Memphis, Tenn., and Clarksdale, Miss. Rifles and ammunition were rushed in. The woods were scoured, Negro homes shot into, Negroes who did not know any trouble was brewing were shot and killed on the highways.\nTelegrams were sent to Governor Brough. He called for Federal troops and five hundred were rushed from Camp Pike, armed with rifles, cannon, gas masks hand grenades, bombs, and machine-guns. The Colonel took “charge of all strategic points,” and “mobilized his men to repel the attack of the black army.” The country was scoured for a radius of fifty to one hundred miles, covering all of Phillips and part of adjoining counties, for “Negro insurrectionists.”\n\nThe soldiers arrested over a thousand Negroes, men and women, and placed them in a “stockade” under heavy guard and kept them there under the most disgusting, unwholesome, and unsanitary conditions. They were not allowed to see friends or attorneys but all of them had to be separately and personally “investigated” by the army officers and a white “committee of seven.” Even after “investigation” had proven completely that a Negro was wholly innocent, still no Negro was released until after a white man had appeared and personally “vouched” for him as being a “good nigger.” The white man was usually a planter or employer and they refused to “vouch” for the Negroes until the Negroes had given assurance and “guarantees” as to work and wages. Finally, all but two or three hundred were released. All Negroes who owned their own farms or were otherwise independent, were held, as a rule, because no white man would vouch for them. In addition to those held by the soldiers, over three hundred were arrested and placed in the jail at Helena, charged with murder and rioting, and refused bond. They were not allowed to see friends or attorneys and were “investigated” by the “committee of seven.” This committee was secret at first. Its membership was not disclosed, but was organized and did its work with the direct sanction of Governor Brough.\nThe next day, after the first killing of the special agent, which occurred at Hoop Spur, 0. G. Bratton, a son of U. S. Bratton, arrived at Ratio. There he met many Negroes who had employed the firm of Bratton & Bratton to obtain their settlements. The Negroes represented the sixty-eight tenants on the Fairthy plantation. They had had no settlement of their 1918 cotton crop until July, 1919, and then no itemized account. Two carloads of their 1919 crop were about to be shipped without settlement and they determined to take the matter into court.\nAbout fifty of them began to pay the cash fees agreed upon. Many had no cash, so they offered him their Liberty Bonds, which he accepted. While collecting this money and giving receipts, a crowd of white men, who were engaged in the “nigger hunt,” came upon him. They arrested Bratton and all the Negroes with him and sent them to jail at Helena, where they were imprisoned on charges of “Murder,” and held without bond.\nBratton was on the train on his way to Ratio, which is twelve miles from Hoop Spur, and he and the Negro clients had not yet heard of the trouble when they met to close up the payment of the cash fees intended for his firm. All this time the white press of Arkansas kept up a hue and cry to the effect that Bratton was there “inciting an uprising of the Negroes and teaching them social equality.” The feeling was so bitter against young Bratton that there were grave threats and fears of his being lynched. The Governor ordered special guards sworn in, patrols were stationed about the jail, and only the utmost precautions prevented the lynching of a man who was not even a lawyer and whose only crime consisted in collecting fees for his father’s firm. It is now openly admitted that Bratton is clearly innocent of any part in the trouble, still he was held thirty-one days without bond in jail and then released without trial, because his father was about to obtain justice for Negro tenants.\nThe saddest and worst feature of the whole miserable slaughter of Negroes was the killing of the four Johnston brothers. They were sons of a prominent and able Negro Presbyterian minister, who is now dead. Their mother is a very prominent woman and was formerly a school teacher. Dr. D. A. E. Johnston was a successful dentist and owned a three-story building in Helena. One brother fought in France and was wounded and gassed in the battle of Chateau-Thierry. Dr. Louis Johnston was a prominent physician and lived in Oklahoma. He had come home on a visit.\nOn the day of the first trouble the four brothers had gone squirrel hunting early that morning and started for home in the evening, wholly ignorant of the trouble at Hoop Spur. While they were miles out in the woods hunting, word of the trouble reached Helena. A merchant told the deputy sheriffs and posse that he had sold some shells to the Johnstons a day or so before the trouble.\nA crowd of men in an auto went to hunt for the Johnstons. They met them returning from the hunt. These white men were supposed friends of the Johnstons. They told them of the trouble and a riot was in progress and that it would be dangerous for any Negro to be on the country roads, especially armed. The Johnstons told them they had just been hunting and had nothing but shot-guns and squirrel shot. They were advised by their friends to turn back and go home by a train that would pass a little station several miles down the road. They took this advice and went to the station to go by rail to Helena. They left their car with a friend, whom they told of the situation. They had bought their tickets and were on the train when up rolled a car with some deputies. They arrested three of the men and took them from the train. The fourth brother, from Oklahoma, also got off. The officers had with them a man named Lilly, a friend of another white man with whom Dentist Johnston had had trouble, the week before. When Dr. Johnston got off the train, the officers told him to go back. He refused, saying, “These men are my brothers. If you arrest them, I will go too.” Then the officers said, “Well, if you are one of the Johnston brothers, we want you, too.” They then arrested the Oklahoma man, whose only crime was that of being a brother to the other three.\nThe men were loaded into an auto and the car went back down the same road they had come over. After going a few miles, a crowd of white men appeared, led by the very “white friends” who had warned the Johnstons to take the train. They had telephoned or sent word to the officers as to where they could get the Johnstons. As the mob approached, Lilly and the officers began to get out of the auto. The Johnstons then saw that they had been led into a trap by their supposed “white friends.” They were handcuffed, but they tried to put up a fight. Just as Lilly was climbing out of the car, preparing to turn the helpless men over to the mob, Dr. Johnston, although shackled, managed to grab Lilly’s pistol from his hand and shot him. The officers and the mob then shot the men literally to pieces. They were sowed with bullets so much so that their faces had to be covered at the funeral, and parts of their bodies were in shreds. The noble mother had to endure the terrible ordeal of seeing four of her fine, promising sons buried in one grave.\nThe main results of the whole miserable business are as follows: five white men and between twenty-five and fifty Negroes were killed in the riots; the stench of dead bodies could be smelled two miles. One thousand Negroes were arrested and one hundred and twenty-two indicted. Evidence was gathered by a committee consisting of two planters, a cotton factor, a merchant, a banker, the sheriff of the county, and the Mayor of Helena. They are said to have used electric connections on the witness chair to scare the Negroes. Sixty-six men have been tried and convicted-twelve sentenced to death, and fifty-four to penitentiary terms. The trials averaged from five to ten minutes each; no witnesses for the defense were called; no Negroes were on the juries; no change of venue was asked.\nThe work of “cleaning up” our people is not yet finished. The Grand Jury is at work and hundreds are to be indicted on charges of murder, rioting, conspiracy, etc. White lawyers at Helena are preparing to reap a harvest of fat fees from Negroes against whom there is no evidence, but who have saved money and property and Liberty Bonds. The Negroes are to be stripped to the bone.\nThe Negroes in the Black Belt are much demoralized, discouraged, and depressed. Hundreds are preparing to leave. Many Negro leaders, who have stood by the white people and who have counseled their race to stay here, now have not a word to say and many of them are also preparing to wind up their affairs and get out of the South. Negroes here live in fear and terror, afraid even to discuss the situation except in whispers and to well-known friends.\nGovernor Brough has issued a statement to the public press that he intends to have the Defender and The Crisis suppressed. The Arkansas Gazette, white, has issued an editorial demanding that Negro leaders give their people “proper advice,” and warning them that their race is in danger of annihilation unless Negroes cease to be led by the lure of Liberty and equal political rights and also warning them that the freedom of the Negro from bad economic conditions is not to be obtained by the methods which were resorted to by the Negroes of Phillips County. Also any white man who fights, either in court or elsewhere, for the rights of the Negro is to be put in jail and suffer social and business ostracism from the white people of the South.\n\nThe Crucifixion at Omaha"

    "text": "Omaha\nFor forty years Omaha was ruled by a political, criminal gang that was perhaps the most lawless of any city of its size in the civilized world. There had grown up during that period, a powerful group who lived on the proceeds of organized vice and crime. These included about three hundred and eighty-four (384) houses of prostitution, together with saloons, pool halls, organized bank robbers, organized highway robbers, and professional “con” men and burglars.\nWhenever a plan was made to have a election of officials, certain men in the community would assemble and hold a conference and they would decide what men it would be “safe” to elect, and they would give The Boss for his service a certain sum of money and control of the vice interests, the Police Department, the Police Court, the juries, and then proceed to elect public officials. This condition obtained, without interruption, from the early history of the city until 1908.\nReforms began in 1908 by an early closing law for saloons, followed by laws which took the control of juries and elections from the vice-ring. In 1916 statewide prohibition was carried.\nWe thus eliminated the whiskey interests which furnished the most of the money for election purposes, the control of the jury and election machinery, from the gang, and the actual disposition of public officers, but we had not eliminated all of the gang. There was still left the Omaha Bee which had been the mouth-piece of the vice-ring, the thugs and murderers who had ruled for years, and these combined to destroy the present city administration and regain control of the Police Department, which was absolutely necessary for the continuation of the reign and control of vice.\nIn order to accomplish this, the Omaha Bee, assisted at times by the other daily papers, began a campaign of slander and vituperation against the Police Department of the City of Omaha, and in order to make it effective they chose a line of propaganda to the effect that Negro men were attacking white women, assaulting them with intent to commit rape, and actually committing rape, with the connivance of the Police Department. They made a majority of the people in Omaha believe that all Negro men were disposed to commit the crime of rape on white women.\nFor years there has been much illegal cohabitation of whites and blacks in Omaha, with about fifteen assignation houses where colored men met white prostitutes. Leading colored citizens asked the police to suppress these dens, but when this was begun, it only increased the slander and vituperation of the Omaha Bee, the organ of the vice-ring. This was kept up successfully until the people believed that the police were invading private property without warrant of law and arresting law-abiding citizens. There was still left in the Police Department from the old regime a large percentage of the police officers protected by Civil Service, who were loyal to the old vice-ring, and they were doing everything within their power to hamper and discredit the honest efforts of the present city administration to enforce the law. The result of this was that together with the campaign of the newspapers, the morale of the Police Department was broken down and the city administration was unable, in the brief space of time that it had been in office, to get rid of these discordant elements. There was, furthermore, in connection with these men, fathered by these same influences, an organized gang determined to wreck the administration at any cost, and they deliberately organized a mob; they furnished it with money and liquor, and the leaders of the old vice-ring stood around in the mob, urging the men to go in and assist in wrecking the Court House, lynch the Negro, and kill the Mayor of the City and other officials. Both Brown, who was lynched, and the woman who accused him belonged to the under-world which met at the houses of assignation. They had quarreled and the woman “got back” at Brown by alleging attempted assault. It is said that at the time she was wearing a diamond ring given her by Brown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nInformation Wanted (1920)\nFlood (1927)\nSlavery (1922)\nArkansas (1920)\nThe Negro and the Land (1914)"

    "text": "The carefully arranged attack on the Negro soldier, delayed and somewhat disarranged by The Crisis’ revelation in May and June, was at last launched in Harvey’s Weekly. The article consisted of a series of falsehoods and half-truths.\n\nThe Ninety-Second Division—was the only Negro division sent to France.\n\nThis is not true. The Ninety-Third Division was also sent to France. Its organization as a division was never completed, but its four Negro regiments were the first American Negro combat troops to arrive and saw more fighting than any American units. The reason for ignoring them was because they were brigaded with the French, trained and treated like men, covered themselves with glory and returned with nearly four hundred citations for bravery.\n\nNegro officers in the Artillery and Engineer regiments were relieved by white officers because of inefficiency.\n\nThis is untrue. No training for Artillery or Engineering was given Negro officers in the Des Moines’ training camp. When it was decided to equip a complete Negro division, naturally, there were no Negro officers trained. After repeated refusals a few received training later under great difficulties and some of these served with their troops.\n\nThe average period allotted for training white troops in France was four weeks. The Ninety-Second was kept in the training area and seven weeks.\n\nThis is true, but the reason is tactfully omitted; the white troops were assembled and trained as full divisions in the United States before embarking; the Negroes were never assembled until they reached France and certain units, like the Artillery, were held back by War Office intrigue among persons who were determined not to let the division function. In the French training schools Negro officers made as good and better record than the whites, while Negro artillerymen held the record with seventy-fives!\nThe meat of this attack lies in the paragraph which asserts that in the Argonne the 368th “refused to obey orders” and “did not go forward” to attack.\nTo this scurrilous attack the Secretary of War has himself replied, quoting the Inspector-General who examined forty-four witnesses. The conclusions are:\n\nThat the 368th regiment was not assigned as an attacking force in the Argonne battle.\nThat the ground was extremely difficult and the regiment only partially equipped for battle.\nThere was no artillery support and the advance met heavy machine-gun and rifle fire.\n\n\nThe circumstances disclosed by a detailed study of the situation do not justify many of the highly colored accounts which have been given of the behavior of the troops in this section, and they afford no basis at all for any of the general assumptions, with regard to the action of colored troops in this battle or elsewhere in France. On the contrary, it is to be noted that many colored officers, and particularly three in the very battalion here under discussion, were decorated with Distinguished Service Crosses for extraordinary heroism under fire.\n\nA detailed description of this battle can be found in The Crisis, June, 1919.\nI have heard the story of this battle from the mouths of Negro officers and soldiers fresh from the hell of war and I am convinced that of all the regiments in France, black and white, none made a more desperate fight or stood a finer test of Negro manhood and leadership than the Three Hundred and Sixty-Eighth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSoldiers (1920)\nOfficers (1917)\nTo the Rescue (1916)\nTo Mr. Emmett Scott (1919)\nWe Should Worry (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1919. “The Negro Soldier.”\nThe Crisis 19 (2): 45–46. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/19/02/negro_soldier.html."

It remembers with no little pride its covers by Richard Brown, William Scott, William Farrow, and Laura Wheeler; and its cartoons by Lorenzo Harris and Albert Smith; it helped to discover the poetry of Roscoe Jamison, Georgia Johnson, Fenton Johnson, Lucian Watkins, and Otto Bohanan; and the prose of Jessie Fauset and Mary Effie Lee. Indeed, The Crisis has always preferred the strong matter of unknown names, to the platitudes of well-known writers; and by its Education and Children numbers, it has shown faith in the young.\nOne colored writer, Claude McKay, asserts that we rejected one of his poems and then quoted it from Pearson’s; and intimates that colored editors, in general, defer to white editors’ opinions. This is, of course, arrogant nonsense. But it does call our attention to the need of encouraging Negro writers. We have today all too few, for the reason that there is a small market for their ideas among whites, and their energies are being called to other and more lucrative ways of earning a living. Nevertheless we have literary ability and the race needs it. A renaissance of American Negro literature is due; the material about us in the strange, heartrending race tangle is rich beyond dream and only we can tell the truth and sing the song from the heart.\nFrom the beginning, the editor has read with care every manuscript sent us, which explains the unconscionable delay in returning many; and yet for three years the editor was editor, business manager, and chief clerk, and only this last year has The Crisis been able to hire an editorial staff even approximately adequate to the work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMencken (1927)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nThe Younger Literary Movement (1924)\nThe True Brownies (1919)\nRadicals (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “Negro Writers.” The Crisis\n19 (6): 298–99. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/19/06/negro_writers.html."

    "text": "Every four years the disgrace of the buying up of certain delegates for the Republican convention is repeated in the Southern South. In South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, there are a few professional grafters, black and white, who assume to represent the “Republican Party.” They are for sale to the highest bidder. Republican candidates begin their campaign by sending men into the South to buy the support of these men, and the whole Negro race is blamed for this recurring disgrace. But whose is the fault? The fault lies at the doors of the National Republican Party. Not only is the party and its candidates willing and eager to buy up this support, but they have repeatedly refused support or countenance to the better class of colored leaders, who seek to oust these thieves. They give recognition and offices to the “Lily Whites” wherever possible, thus carrying out a policy, begun by Theodore Roosevelt and brought to its highest fruition by William H. Taft.\nOnly yesterday in Tennessee, where a real Republican movement with high aims and efficient leadership has been led in the western part of the state by R.R. Church, a Republican convention composed only of white men calmly ousted every black Republican. And it stands every chance of being given recognition by the National Republican Committee, which refused to seat Perry Howard of Mississippi, who was legally elected and in the face of right and justice, put a white man in his place. So that the Republican Party has practically said to the South,— No decent colored man need apply and we will recognize anything, decent or indecent, among white politicians.\nTo cap all this, the party refuses to take a single step toward enforcing the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, or to stop the disgraceful disfranchisement of colored voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHow Shall We Vote (1920)\nThe Negro in Politics (1929)\nRemember (1920)\nThe Republicans (1915)\nThe Negro Party (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “Every Four Years.” The\nCrisis 19 (6): 297. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/19/06/every_four_years.html."

    "title": "The Tuskegee Hospital",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We have strong reasons for believing that the following are the actual facts concerning the Tuskegee Hospital:\n\nThe Harding administration, without consultation with Negro leaders, made Dr. R.R. Moton a sort of referee for 12 million Negroes as to the personnel of the hospital and the Veterans’ Bureau promised him categorically that he would be consulted before anybody was appointed superintendent of the hospital.\nColonel Robert H. Stanley, a white man, was made superintendent of the hospital and arrived at Tuskegee two days before Dr. Moton was notified.\nPlans were made to open the hospital April first with a full white staff of white doctors and white nurses with colored nurse-maids for each white nurse, in order to save them from contact with colored patients!\nOn February 14th Dr. Moton wrote President Harding and told him that if Negro physicians and nurses were debarred from service in the hospital without at least being given a chance to qualify under the Civil Service rules it would bring justifiable criticism upon him and upon the Harding administration.\nDr. Moton wrote to the Superintendent of the hospital asking that the opening of the hospital be delayed. The Superintendent replied that there could be no mixture of races in the staff.\nStrong pressure was put upon Dr. Moton to make him change his position and the Governor of Alabama, together with General R.E. Steiner, telegraphed the President protesting against a mixed staff and demanding a full white staff. Steiner is the head of the American Legion in Alabama and he is the one who in New Orleans fought to keep Negro ex-service men from membership in the Legion; consequently no Negro ex-service men in Alabama can have any affiliation whatsoever with the American Legion. Meantime Dr. Moton was threatened by the Ku Klux Klan and others and Tuskegee school had to place armed guards at his home.\nOn February 23 President Harding called Dr. Moton into conference after which the President issued an executive order calling for a special examination for Negro applicants for places on the hospital staff.\nThe only interest of white people in Alabama in this hospital is economic and racial. They want to draw the government salaries and they do not want any Negro officials in Alabama whom the state cannot dominate. To illustrate this: the contract for burying soldiers was given to a white undertaker from Greenville, South Carolina, before the bids of local colored undertakers had a chance even to be submitted.\nThe Civil Service Commission is delaying unnecessarily and unreasonably in arranging for examinations and qualifying colored physicians and without doubt are going to cheat in every possible way.\n\nIn commenting on all this we can simply gasp. Is it not inconceivable? Human hatred, meanness and cupidity gone stark mad! Separating races in hospitals and graveyards and fighting to put white men over a Negro hospital! Giving nurses black maids to do the work while the white “ladies” eat with the internes, dance at the balls and flirt with the doctors and black men die! Lying, postponing, deceiving, threatening to keep out black doctors and nurses. What will be the result? What can be the result? What decent Negro physician or devoted black nurse will dare go to this nest of barbarism?\nWe honor Moton for his present stand and sympathize with him in his undoubted danger and humiliation. But this leads us to condemn him all the more sharply and unsparingly for the last part which he has played in inter-racial politics.\nHere was a great government duty to take care of black soldiers wounded in soul and body by their awful experience in the Great War. They ought to have been cared for without discrimination in the same hospitals and under the same circumstances as white soldiers. But even if this were impossible because of race hatred, certainly the last place on God’s green earth to put a segregated Negro hospital was in the lynching belt of mob-ridden Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and their ilk.\nIt occurred to some of our bright Northern white philanthropists and politicians that the shunting of this institution to Tuskegee was exactly the thing; and the tool they found ready to their hand to carry this out was Dr. R.R. Moton.\n“Chickens come home to roost.” Tuskegee is no place for such a hospital. It is not and cannot be an integral part of the school, which the public opinion of the world of the memory of Booker T. Washington partially protects from Alabama mobs. Outside of such schools as Tuskegee and the larger cities, there is no protection in central Alabama for a decent Negro pig-pen, much less for an institution to restore the life and health of those very black servants of the nation, whom Alabama, led by the cowardly Steiner, has kicked out of the American Legion.\nAny Negro in such a hospital, under Southern white men and women of the type who are now fighting like beasts to control it, would be a subject of torture and murder rather than of restoration of health. The only decent method would have been to have placed the institution in the law-abiding North where it belongs; and even now, despite the fact that these millions of dollars of brick and equipment have been sunk into the morass of the black belt, the best way out of the mess would be to tear the hospital down and rebuild it within the confines of civilization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOfficers (1917)\nBurleson (1913)\nSegregation (1928)\nAn Open Letter to Robert Russa Moton (1916)\nConsolation (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1923. “The Tuskegee Hospital.”\nThe Crisis 26 (3): 106–7. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/26/03/tuskegee_hospital.html."

    "title": "The Tragedy of ‘Jim Crow’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There is developing within the Negro race a situation bordering on tragedy in regard to the “Jim Crow” movement now growing and spreading in the North. The tragedy has been with us before but it has been more or less dormant and unspoken. To-day it is flaring to red flame and we must sit down and reason together.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI stood yesterday before three thousand folk in Philadelphia and said at length what I am saying now more concisely and definitely. It was an earnest crowd quivering with excitement and feeling, and the thing that it had in mind was this:\nFor 90 years, Pennsylvania has had a private colored school founded by Richard Humphreys, a West Indian ex-slave-holder. The institute was located first on Lombard Street, Philadelphia, then on Bainbridge Street and finally in 1911 was removed to Cheyney, twenty miles from Philadelphia in a beautiful section where new buildings were erected and a normal school equipped.\nMany distinguished persons have been at the head of the school including Charles L. Reason of New York, Ebenezer D. Bassett, afterward Minister to Haiti, the late Fannie Jackson Coppin, Hugh Brown and at present Leslie P. Hill, Harvard ’03, Phi Beta Kappa. In 1914, the school began to receive State aid at the rate of $6,000 every two years. In 1920, the school was made a State Normal School with an appropriation of $125,000 per year for two years.\nMeantime the Northern states slowly struggled out from the shadow of “Jim Crow” school legislation. The schools of New York City became mixed and Negro teachers were appointed who taught without segregation. The same thing happened in Massachusetts, in Northern Illinois and Northern Ohio; in Pennsylvania it became in 1881, “unlawful” to make “any distinction whatever” on account of race among public school children.\nNotwithstanding this, separate Negro schools with Negro teachers in Northern states continued to exist. For some time they declined in number; then came the growing concentration of Negroes in cities and finally the new Negro migration from the South. This meant quiet but persistent and renewed attempts at school segregation. The number of separate schools increased in the North, and in Kansas segregation was legalized by permissive legislature.\nIn Philadelphia particularly separation was carried far by administrative action despite the law, so that to-day while the high school and 200 common schools have colored and white pupils, there are eleven schools with Negro pupils alone, and colored teachers are appointed only in those schools. Thus segregated schools are on the increase in the North and there is no doubt but what we shall see a larger and larger number of them as the flood tide of Southern Negro migration increases.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhat shall be our attitude toward this segregation? The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People together with its organ, The Crisis, and all thinking men, white and black, have long since taken strong ground against compulsory racial segregation of any sort. This has been true from the foundation of the Association; and we have especially insisted that of all the sorts of segregation and discrimination that meet the Negroes in the United States, that in the common public schools is most dangerous, most insidious, the most far reaching.\nEducation in the public schools by races or by classes means the perpetuation of race and class feeling throughout the land. It means the establishment of group hostility in those tender years of development when prejudices tend to become “natural” and “instinctive.” It is the plain duty of all true Americans who believe in democracy and broad human development to oppose this spread of segregation in the public schools.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOn the other hand we are to-day, as practical thinkers and workers, faced by the grim fact of a school segregation already in being: of public common schools, private common schools, high schools and colleges attended exclusively by Negroes and manned wholly and largely by Negroes. Our educational plight is still precarious; but without the self-sacrificing efficient colored teacher of colored youth to-day, we would face positive disaster. These teachers have in their ranks some of the finest trained men and women in the world and the black race can never repay them for the work they have done under difficulty and deprivation, obloquy and insult, and sometimes even with the hatred and abuse of colored folk themselves.\nHere then we face the amazing paradox: we must oppose segregation in schools; we must honor and appreciate the colored teacher in the colored school.\nHow can we follow this almost self-contradictory program? Small wonder that Negro communities have been torn in sunder by deep and passionate differences of opinion arising from this pitiable dilemma.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDespite all theory and almost unconsciously we are groping on. We recognize one thing worse than segregation and that is ignorance. There is, for instance, among the Negroes of the United States no effort to disestablish the separate public schools of the South. Why? They are wrong; they are undemocratic; they are ridiculously and fatally costly; they mean inferior schools for colored people, discrimination in equipment and curriculum; and yet so long as the race feeling is what it is in the South, mixed schools are utterly impossible. Even if by law we could force colored children into the white schools, they would not be educated. They would be abused, browbeaten, murdered, kept in something worse than ignorance. What is true in the South is true in most parts of the border states and in some parts of the North. In some of these regions where there are mixed schools, innocent colored children of tender years are mercilessly mistreated and discriminated against and practically forced out of school before they have finished the primary grades. Even in many of the best Northern states colored pupils while admitted and treated fairly, receive no inspiration or encouragement.\nHow else can we explain the astonishing fact that with practically the same kinds of colored population in cities like Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, the 200,000 Negroes in Washington and Baltimore send out 400 colored High School graduates every year, while 250,000 Negroes in Philadelphia and New York send out only 50? Moreover the academic standards of these colored High Schools have been proven to be fairly high by the success of their graduates in Northern colleges. What are we going to do about this? First and foremost and more important than anything else, Negro children must not be allowed to grow up in ignorance. This is worse than segregation, worse than anything we could contemplate.\nThere is only one method to avoid both this and segregation and that is by efforts such as are being made in New York City. The movement is still young and wavering, but it is a beginning. We are trying there to superintend the course of colored children in the mixed public school. We are seeking to guide them there and to help them at home; we try to discover and oppose prejudiced teachers; we encourage their enrollment in High Schools. There is no reason why a movement like this, pushed with unwavering determination, should not succeed in bringing the High School enrollment of black New York up to the level of Washington, Baltimore and St. Louis.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn Philadelphia no such movement is manifest. On the contrary with the colored citizens largely asleep for a long time, the solution of separate colored schools has been accepted with only half-hearted protest. To-day, however, strangely enough protest has risen to fever heat, and why? Because two years ago, Cheyney was made a colored State Normal School. We say colored advisedly because there is no use of stickling at facts or dodging behind legal quibbles. Cheyney is to-day a State Normal School for Negroes. Is this a fault, and if so whose fault is it? A large number of honest and earnest colored people in Philadelphia—persons who have cooperated with this Association and who believe in its work and possibilities, have taken this stand:\n\nThere is a conspiracy in Philadelphia to segregate all colored teacher training of the state in Cheyney, where with inferior equipment, colored teachers will be educated and sent out for use in a growing system of segregated colored public schools.\nThat Leslie Hill and his teachers are at least in part responsible for the programme and have aided and abetted it.\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt many white people of Pennsylvania have the programme above in mind; without doubt principals of many of the other thirteen Normal Schools and some public school officials would welcome and push to the limit of the law and past it, the segregation of colored teachers and pupils; but there is no proof that all white folk in authority want this; there is no proof that the state does not intend to make Cheyney the equal of any other State Normal School; moreover according to present law no Negro is compelled to attend Cheyney. All of the other 13 normal schools of the State remain absolutely open to those who wish to attend them. And above all, proof is absolutely lacking that Hill and his teachers are dishonest betrayers of the interests of their race.\nLeslie Hill and his wife Jane Hill have had honorable and self-sacrificing records. He has surrounded himself by the best faculty his limited funds would allow: Harvard, Radcliffe, the University of London and similar schools have trained them. I have seen schools in two continents and ten countries and I have yet to see a finer group in character and service than the teachers of Cheyney. And yet for three months these people were actually deprived of bread and butter by legal injunctions and pursued by denunciation, ostracism and innuendo, while the real culprits, the white “Jim Crow” officials, publicists and philanthropists stood aside unscathed and smiling to see the “darkies” quarrel.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI am not for a moment calling in question the motives and sincerity of those in Philadelphia who are fighting segregation. In such a fight I am with them heart and soul. But when this fight becomes a fight against Negro school teachers I quit. I believe in Negro school teachers. I would to God white children as well as colored could have more of them. With proper training they are the finest teachers in the world because they have suffered and endured and nothing human is beneath their sympathy.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI know perfectly well that there have been colored educators and leaders who in order to get funds for their schools and enterprises and positions for their friends and children have betrayed and sold out the interests of their race and humanity. I have denounced and will denounce such men unsparingly. But it does not follow that when a black man makes a black enterprise the best and most efficient for its purpose that he is necessarily a traitor or that he believes in segregation by race. A condition, not a theory confronts him. It was the duty of Hill to make Cheyney a school. He did not found Cheyney. It was founded half a century before he was born. He did try and is trying to raise it from the status of a second class High School without funds, equipment or recognition, to one of the best normal schools of one of the greatest states of the Union. Those folk, white or black, who seek to saddle this programme with a permanent “Jim Crow” school policy in the commonwealth of William Penn deserve the damning of every decent American citizen; and those folk are not black folk—they are white and wealthy and powerful, and many of them are distinguished Quakers.\nThe real fight in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania should be made on the following lines:\n\nTo stop by agitation, political power, and legal method, all further increase of public common schools segregated by race. The appointment and election of openly sympathetic school officials is the first step in this campaign\nTo continue to insist on the appointment of colored teachers in white schools\nTo support the efforts to make the present segregated schools the very best possible and to open them to white children\nTo make Cheyney the best Normal School in the state and to encourage the entry of white students\nTo see to it by scholarships and local efforts that colored pupils are kept in every other normal school of the state\nTo make the colored teacher feel that no calling is so fine and valuable as his and that the Negro race and the world knows it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nJim Crow (1919)\nBlessed Discrimination (1913)\nA Statement (1919)\nThe “Jim Crow” Argument (1913)\nThe Proper Way (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1923. “The Tragedy of ‘Jim\nCrow’.” The Crisis 26 (4): 169–72. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/26/04/tradgedy_of_jim_crow.html."

    "text": "We are glad to note that the University of Missouri has opened a course in Applied Lynching. Many of our American Universities have long defended the institution, but they have not been frank or brave enough actually to arrange a mob murder so that the students could see it in detail.\nThe University of Georgia did, to be sure, stage a lynching a few years ago but this was done at night and the girls did not have a fair chance to see it. At the University of Missouri the matter was arranged in broad daylight with ample notice, by five hundred men and boys who were “comparatively orderly,” and it was viewed by some fifty women most of whom we understand were students of the University. We are very much in favor of this method of teaching 100 percent Americanism; as long as mob murder is an approved institution in the United States, students at the universities should have a first hand chance to judge exactly what a lynching is.\nIn the case of James T. Scott everything was as it should be. He was a janitor at the University who protested his innocence to his last breath. He was charged with having “lured” a fourteen year old girl in broad daylight far from her home and “down the railroad tracks.” He was “positively identified” by the girl, and while the father deprecates violence he has “no doubt” of the murdered man’s guilt.\nHere was every element of the modern American lynching. We are glad that the future fathers and mothers of the West saw it, and we are expecting great results from this course of study at one of the most eminent of our State Universities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLynching (1927)\nLynching (1914)\nCauses of Lynching (1931)\nLynchings (1932)\nLynchings and Mobs (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1923. “A University Course in Lynching.”\nThe Crisis 26 (2): 55. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/26/02/university_course_in_lynching.html."

    "title": "Marcus Garvey",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An article in the December Crisis gave Mr. Garvey’s personal history. This article considers his industrial enterprises and the feasibility of his general plans.\nWhen it comes to Mr.Garvey’s industrial and commercial enterprises there is more ground for doubt and misgiving than in the matter of his character. First of all, his enterprises are incorporated in Delaware, where the corporation laws are loose and where no financial statements are required.1 So far as I can find, and I have searched with care, Mr. Garvey has never published a complete statement of the income and expenditures of the Negro Improvement Association or of the Black Star Line or of any of his enterprises, which really revealed his financial situation. A courteous letter of inquiry sent to him July 22, 1920, asking for such financial data as he was willing for the public to know, remains to this day unacknowledged and unanswered.\nNow a refusal to publish a financial statement is no proof of dishonesty, but it is proof that either Garvey is ill-advised and unnecessarily courting suspicion, or that his industrial enterprises are not on a sound business basis; otherwise he is too good an advertiser not to use a promising balance sheet for all it is worth.\nThere has been one balance sheet, published July 26, 1920, purporting to give the financial condition of the Black Star Line after one year of operation; neither profit or loss is shown, there is no way to tell the actual cash receipts or the true condition of the business. Nevertheless it does make some interesting revelations.\nThe total amount of stock subscribed for is $590,860. Of this $118,153.28 is not yet paid for, leaving the actual amount of paid-in capital charged against the corporation, $472,706.72. Against this stands only $355,214.59 of assets (viz.: $21,985.21 in cash deposits and loans receivable; $12,975.01 in furniture and equipment, $288,515.37 which is the alleged value of his boats, $26,000 in real estate and $5,739 of insurance paid in advance). To offset the assets he has $152,264.14 of other liabilities (accrued salaries, $1,539.30; notes and accounts payable, $129,224.84; mortgages due $21,500). In other words, his capital stock of $472,706.72 is after a year’s business impaired to such extent that he has only $202,950.45 to show for it.\nEven this does not reveal the precariousness of his actual business condition. Banks before the war in lending their credit refused to recognize any business as safe unless for every dollar of current liabilities there were two dollars of current assets. Today, since the war, they require three dollars of current assets to every one of current liabilities. The Black Star Line had July 26, $16,485.21 in current assets anc $130,764.14 in current liabilities, when recognition by any reputable bank called for $390,000 in current assets.\nMoreover, another sinister admission appears in this statement: the cost of floating the Black Star Line to date has been $289,066.27. In other words, it has cost nearly $300,000 to collect a capital of less than half a million. Garvey has, in other words, spent more for advertisement than he has for his boats!\nThis is a serious situation, and even this does not tell the whole story: the real estate, furniture, etc., listed above, are probably valued correctly. But how about the boats? The Yarmouth is a wooden steamer of 1,452 gross tons, built in 1887 It is old and unseaworthy; it came near sinking a year ago and it has cost a great deal for repairs. It is said that it is now laid up for repairs with a large bill due. Without doubt the inexperienced purchasers of this vessel paid far more than it is worth, and it will soon be utterly worthless unless rebuilt at a very high cost.2\nThe cases of the Kanawha (or Antonio Maceo) and the Shadyside are puzzling. Neither of these boats is registered as belonging to the Black Star Line at all. The former is recorded as belonging to C. L. Dimon, and the latter to the North and East River Steamboat Company. Does the Black Star Line really own these boats, or is it buying them by installments, or only leasing them? We do not know the facts and have been unable to find out. Under the circumstances they look like dubious “assets.”\nThe majority of the Black Star stock is apparently owned by the Universal Negro Improvement Association. There is no reason why this association, if it will and can, should not continue to pour money into its corporation. Let us therefore consider then Mr. Garvey’s other resources.\nMr. Garvey’s income consists of (a) dues from members of the U.N.I. Association; (b) shares in the Black Star Line and other enterprises, and (c) gifts and “loans” for specific objects. If the U.N.I. Association has “3,000,000 members” then the income from that source alone would be certainly over a million dollars a year. If, as is more likely, it has under 300,000 paying members, he may collect $150,000 annually from this source. Stock in the Black Star Line is still being sold. Garvey himself tells of one woman who had saved about four hundred dollars in gold: “She brought out all the gold and bought shares in the Black Star Line.” Another man writes this touching letter from the Canal Zone: “I have sent twice to buy shares amounting to $125, (numbers of certificates 3752 and 9617). Now I am sending $35 for seven more shares. You might think I have money, but the truth, as I stated before, is that I have no money now. But if I’m to die of hunger it will be all right because I’m determined to do all that’s in my power to better the conditions of my race.”3\nIn addition to this he has asked for special contributions. In the spring of 1920 he demanded for his coming convention in August, “a fund of two million dollars ($2,000,000) to capitalize this, the greatest of all conventions.” In October he acknowledged a total of something over $16,000 in small contributions. Immediately he announced “a constructive loan” of $2,000,000, which he is presumably still seeking to raise.4\nFrom these sources of income Mr. Garvey has financed his enterprises and carried on a wide and determined propaganda, maintained a large staff of salaried officials, clerks and agents, and published a weekly newspaper. Notwithstanding this considerable income, there is no doubt that Garvey’s expenditures are pressing hard on his income, and that his financial methods are so essentially unsound that unless he speedily revises them the investors will certainly get no dividends and worse may happen.5 He is apparently using the familiar method of “Kiting”—i.e., the money which comes in as investment in stock is being used in current expenses, especially in heavy overhead costs, for clerk hire, interest and display. Even his boats are being used for advertisement more than for business—lying in harbors as exhibits, taking excursion parties, etc. These methods have necessitated mortgages on property and continually new and more grandiose schemes to collect larger and larger amounts of ready cash. Meantime, lacking business men of experience, his actual business ventures have brought in few returns, involved heavy expense and threatened him continually with disaster or legal complication.\nOn the other hand, full credit must be given Garvey for a bold effort and some success. He has at least put vessels manned and owned by black men on the seas and they have carried passengers and cargoes. The difficulty is that he does not know the shipping business, he does not understand the investment of capital, and he has few trained and staunch assistants.\nThe present financial plight of an inexperienced and headstrong promoter may therefore decide the fate of the whole movement. This would be a calamity. Garvey is the beloved leader of tens of thousands of poor and bewildered people who have been cheated all their lives. His failure would mean a blow to their faith, and a loss of their little savings, which it would take generations to undo.\nMoreover, shorn of its bombast and exaggeration, the main lines of the Garvey plan are perfectly feasible. What he is trying to say and do is this: American Negroes can, by accumulating and ministering their own capital, organize industry, join the black centers of the south Atlantic by commercial enterprise and in this way ultimately redeem Africa as a fit and free home for black men. This is true. It is feasible. It is, in a sense, practical; but it will take for its accomplishment long years of painstaking, self-sacrificing effort. It will call for every ounce of ability, knowledge, experience and devotion in the whole Negro race. It is not a task for one man or one organization, but for co-ordinate effort on the part of millions. The plan is not original with Garvey but he has popularized it, made it a living, vocal ideal and swept thousands with him with intense belief in the possible accomplishment of the ideal.\nThis is a great, human service; but when Garvey forges ahead and almost single-handed attempts to realize his dream in a few years, with large words and wild gestures, he grievously minimizes his task and endangers his cause.\nTo instance one illustrative fact: there is no doubt but what Garvey has sought to import to America and capitalize the antagonism between blacks and mulattoes in the West Indies. This has been the cause of the West Indian failures to gain headway against the whites. Yet Garvey imports it into a land where it has never had any substantial footing and where today, of all days, it is absolutely repudiated by every thinking Negro; Garvey capitalizes it, has sought to get the cooperation of men like R. R. Moton on this basis, and has aroused more bitter color enmity inside the race than has ever before existed. The whites are delighted at the prospect of a division of our solidifying phalanx, but their hopes are vain. American Negroes recognize no color line in or out of the race, and they will in the end punish the man who attempts to establish it.\nThen too Garvey increases his difficulties in other directions. He is a British subject. He wants to trade in British territory. Why then does he needlessly antagonize and even insult Britain? He wants to unite all Negroes. Why then does he sneer at the work of the powerful group of his race in the United States where he finds asylum and sympathy? Particularly, why does he decry the excellent and rising business enterprises of Harlem—intimating that his schemes alone are honest and sound when the facts flatly contradict him? He proposes to settle his headquarters in Liberia—but has he asked permission of the Liberian government? Does he presume to usurp authority in a land which has successfully withstood England, France and the United States,—but is expected tamely to submit to Marcus Garvey? How long does Mr. Garvey think that President King would permit his anti-English propaganda on Liberian soil, when the government is straining every nerve to escape the Lion’s Paw?\nAnd, finally, without arms, money, effective organization or base of operations, Mr. Garvey openly and wildly talks of “Conquest” and of telling white Europeans in Africa to “get out!” and of becoming himself a black Napoleon!\nSuppose Mr. Garvey should drop from the clouds and concentrate on his industrial schemes as a practical first step toward his dreams: the first duty of a great commercial enterprise is to carry on effective commerce. A man who sees in industry the key to a situation, must establish sufficient businesslike industries. Here Mr. Garvey has failed lamentably.\nThe Yarmouth, for instance, has not been a commercial success. Stories have been published alleging its dirty condition and the inexcusable conduct of its captain and crew. To this Mr. Garvey may reply that it was no easy matter to get efficient persons to run his boats and to keep a schedule. This is certainly true, but if it is difficult to secure one black boat crew, how much more difficult is it going to be to “build and operate factories in the big industrial centers of the United States, Central America, the West Indies and Africa to manufacture every marketable commodity”? and also “to purchase and build ships of larger tonnage for the African and South American trade”? and also to raise “Five Million Dollars to free Liberia” where “new buildings are to be erected, administrative buildings are to be built, colleges and universities are to be constructed”? and finally to accomplish what Mr. Garvey calls the “Conquest of Africa!”\nTo sum up: Garvey is a sincere, hard-working idealist; he is also a stubborn, domineering leader of the mass; he has worthy industrial and commercial schemes but he is an inexperienced business man. His dreams of Negro industry, commerce and the ultimate freedom of Africa are feasible; but his methods are bombastic, wasteful, illogical and ineffective and almost illegal. If he learns by experience, attracts strong and capable friends and helpers instead of making needless enemies; if he gives up secrecy and suspicion and substitutes open and frank reports as to his income and expenses, and above all if he is willing to be a co-worker and not a czar, he may yet in time succeed in at least starting some of his schemes toward accomplishment. But unless he does these things and does them quickly he cannot escape failure.\nLet the followers of Mr. Garvey insist that he get down to bed-rock business and make income and expense balance; let them gag Garvey’s wilder words, and still preserve his wide power and influence. American Negro leaders are not jealous of Garvey—they are not envious of his success; they are simply afraid of his failure, for his failure would be theirs. He can have all the power and money that he can efficiently and honestly use, and if in addition he wants to prance down Broadway in a green shirt, let him—but do not let him foolishly overwhelm with bankruptcy and disaster one of the most interesting spiritual movements of the modern Negro world."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nMr. Garvey boasts Feb. 14, 1920: “This week I present you with the Black Star Line Steamship Corporation recapitalized at ten million dollars. They told us when we incorporated this corporation that we could not make it, but we are now gone from a $5,000,000 corporation to one of $10,000,000.” This sounds impressive, but means almost nothing. The fee for incorporating a $5,000,000 concern in Delaware is $350. By paying $250 more the corporation may incorporate with $10,000,000 authorized capital without having a cent of capital actually paid in! Cf. “General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware,” edition of 1917.↩︎\nTechnically the Yarmouth does not belong to the Black Star Line of Delaware, but to the “Black Star Line of Canada, Limited,” incorporated in Canada, March 23, 1920, with one million dollars capital. This capital consists of $500 cash and $999,500 “assets.” Probably the Black Star Line of Delaware controls this corporation, but this is not known.↩︎\nP.N. Gordon↩︎\n“The Universal Negro Improvement Association is raising a constructive loan of two million dollars from its members. Three hundred thousand dollars out of this two million has been allotted to the New York Local as its quota, and already the members in New York have started to subscribe to the loan, and in the next seven days the three hundred thousand dollars will be oversubscribed. The great divisions of Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Wilmington, Baltimore and Washington will also over subscribe their quota to make up the two million dollars.”  Constructive work will be started in January 1921, when the first ship of the Black Star Line on the African trade will sail from New York with materials and workmen for this constructive work.”  Eleven days later, November 6th, the Negro World is still “raising the loan” but there is no report of the amount raised.↩︎\nIt might be argued that it is not absolutely necessary that the Black Star Line, etc., should pay financially. It is quite conceivable that Garvey should launch a business philanthropy, and that without expectation of return, colored people should contribute for a series of years to support Negro enterprise. But this is not Garvey’s idea. He says plainly in a circular:  The Black Star Line corporation presents to every Black Man, Woman and Child the opportunity to climb the great ladder of industrial and commercial progress. If you have ten dollars, one hundred dollars, or one or five thousand dollars to invest for profit, then take out shares in The Black Star Line, Inc. This corporation is chartered to trade on every sea and all waters. The Black Star Line will turn over large profits and dividends to stockholders, and operate to their interest even whist they will be asleep.”↩︎"

    "text": "The growth of a body of public opinion among peoples of Negro descent broad enough to be called Pan-African is a movement belonging almost entirely to the twentieth century.\nSeven hundred and fifty years before Christ the Negroes as rulers of Ethiopia and conquerors of Egypt were practically supreme in the civilized world; but the character of the African continent was such that this supremacy brought no continental unity; rather the inhabitants of the narrow Nile Valley set their faces toward the Mediterranean and Asia more than toward the western Sudan, the valley of the Congo and the Atlantic.\nFrom that time even in the rise of the Sudanese kingdoms of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries there was still no Pan-Africa; and after that the slave trade brought continental confusion.\nIn 1900 at the time of the Paris Exposition there was called on January 23, 24 and 25 a Pan-African Conference in Westminster Hall, London. This conference said in its address to the world:\n\nIn the metropolis of the modern world, in this the closing year of the nineteenth century, there has been assembled a congress of men and women of African blood, to deliberate solemnly upon the present situation and outlook of the darker races of mankind. The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the colour line, the question as to how far differences of race, which show themselves chiefly in the colour of the skin and the texture of the hair, are going to be made, hereafter, the basis of denying to over half the world the right of sharing to their utmost ability the opportunities and privileges of modern civilization.\n\nA second conference was held at Tuskegee Institute about 1912.\nFinally, at the time of the Peace Conference in Paris, February 1919, the first Pan-African Congress was called. The interest in this congress was worldwide among the darker peoples. Delegates were elected in the United States, the West Indies, South and West Africa and elsewhere. Most of them, of course, were prevented from attending by war measures and physical difficulties.\nHowever, there did assemble in Paris, 57 delegates from 15 countries where over 85,000,000 Negroes and persons of African descent dwell. Resolutions were adopted taking up the question of the relation of Africa to the League of Nations, and the general questions of land, capital, labor, education, hygiene and the treatment of civilized Negroes. Blaise Diagne, Deputy from Senegal and Commissioner in charge of the French Colonial Troops, was elected president of a permanent organization, and W.E.B. DuBois of the United States, Editor of The Crisis, was made secretary. A second congress was called to meet in Paris in September, 1921.\nMeantime, the feeling of the necessity for understanding among the Africans and their descendants has been growing throughout the world. There was held from March 11-29, 1920, the National Congress of British West Africa. This body after careful conference adopted resolutions concerning legislative reforms, the franchise, administrative changes, a West African University, commercial enterprise, judicial and sanitary programs. They also stated their opinion concerning the land question and self-determination and sent a deputation to the King. The deputation, consisting of 3 lawyers, 2 merchants, an ex-Deputy Mayor, a physician and a native ruler, went to England and presented to the King a demand for the right to vote, local self-government, and other matters.\nOther movements have gone on. In the agitation for Egyptian independence there is a large number of men of Negro descent. In South Africa, the African Political Organization and the Native Congress have had a number of conferences and have sent delegates to London, protesting against the land legislation of the Union of South Africa.\nIn the Canal Zone and in the West Indies have come movements looking toward union of effort among peoples of African descent and emphasizing the economic bond. In the United States there is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, with its 90,000 members and its very wide influence and activities.\nMany of these movements will be represented in the second Pan-African Congress next fall, and out of this meeting will undoubtedly grow a larger and larger unity of thought among Negroes and through this, concerted action. At first this action will probably include a demand for political rights, for economic freedom—especially in relation to the land—for the abolition of slavery, peonage and caste, and for freer access to education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Pan-African Congresses: The Story of a Growing Movement (1927)\nMemorandum to M.

They have shown themselves in states like Georgia and Louisiana to be more modern and sensible than their white sisters; and throughout the country they cast a large and influential vote.\nIn the encouragement which they have received before and since the election there has been but one false note. James B. Dudley, colored president of a state school in Greensboro, N.C., came out in the local paper before election with several columns of advice to colored women not to attempt to vote. The arguments adduced deserve no particular consideration. They were the familiar remarks about “women in the home” and the general unwisdom of Negroes “meddling” in politics. Mr. Dudley received the usual pat on the back from the white editor. The grave and astonishing thing about this is that at this late day a Negro leader, North or South, should dare to advise colored men or women not to vote. This was a general procedure 25 and even 15 years ago, but we have almost forgotten it, and it is to be hoped that James B. Dudley is the last of a pitiable group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVotes for Women (1918)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nYoung Voters (1932)\nThe Colored Voter (1919)\nThe Negro Party (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “The Woman Voter.”\nThe Crisis 21 (5): 200. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/21/05/woman_voter.html."

In the first, the land may easily go to the dogs while the Dreamer walks his high and isolated path. In the other case, we may too easily forget our dreams.\nBut both sorts of Voters on November 2, 1920, were in maddening puzzlement. The League of Nations? There was no real difference between the parties; between Johnson and Wilson there was a world of argument; but Taft and Holt, Hoover and Cox? It was all a matter of punctuation and style. No man then could vote either the Republican or the Democratic ticket because he favored or opposed the League. And outside the League, What? Imperialism, labor and wage, the power of capital, the marketing of farm products, the building of homes, the training of children, the ownership of land, the freedom of suffrage—in these and all else the major parties were mere fog or reaction. Indeed the only real, stinging, fighting questions in the whole campaign were President Wilson and the Negro."

    "text": "There was a time when the South appealed to the world against the Negro on the ground that he was ignorant and inefficient. The answer to this was that education and social justice would gradually work the same changes in black as in white folk. Nevertheless, the strength of the southern argument lay in its insistence that during the transition from the ignorance of slavery to the efficiency of freedom, temporary disfranchisement and segregation were justifiable. It was this plea, repeated again and again with every appeal to class feeling and personal experience, that gained in the land and in the world so wide an acquiescence in the Southern Caste program.\nMeantime in slow and fatal certainty the problem changed. The educated and efficient Negro appeared—now here and there, now in groups and mass movements. Subtly the southern argument changed. It was not merely ignorance and inefficiency that was to be feared—it was rather the intelligence and efficiency of black folk. Indeed the more gifted and better trained the black man, the more the white man must fear him. In other words, it is not human stupidity and blundering that the South fights, it is race; and if one immediately points out that according to modern science there is no such thing as “race,” the argument marches right on with the mediaeval Blumenbach and Gobineau.\nNothing illustrates this descensus Averno better than woman suffrage. The Washington correspondent of the Norfolk, Va., Virginian Pilot in an interview with Representative Henry D. Flood, “dean of the Virginia delegation in the House,” says that Section 19 of the Virginia Constitution, which Mr. Flood would revive to meet the present occasion, was the famous alternative military, property, or understanding qualification. Under it a white applicant for registration would not necessarily be disqualified if unable to read and write, whereas a colored applicant would not necessarily be qualified even if able to read and write.\n“This,” said Mr. Flood today, “would enable all the white women in the state to be registered and would practically exclude all the Negro women, throwing the same safeguards round the electorate with regard to females as in 1902 and 1903 we threw round it with regard to males.”\nNot satisfied with this amazing confession, the Virginian Pilot replies editorially (the italics are ours):\n\nTo invoke Article 19 anew and apply it to a State-wide registration of women when suffrage becomes a fait accompli, would be to bring to the fore again public distempers that have long lain dormant. It would be far less easy in the present state of belligerent race consciousness to apply this article in such a manner as to obtain the desired end today, than it was 29 years ago. … It is not the superior intelligence of colored women over colored men that threatens white supremacy. They cannot become a disturbing political factor until their intelligence as a class is superior to that of white women. If an inexplicable reversion of all recorded history should put such an eventuality within the range of probability it will not occur overnight. There will be ample warning and it will be time enough then to resort to a drastic redressing of the voting lists.\n\nThink of it! If the black race at any time or place comes to excel the whites, then we will pull them down by force! Will we?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLight (1912)\nSocial Equality (1916)\n‘Social Equality’ (1911)\nTillman (1918)\nThe Unfortunate South (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1920. “Suffrage.” The Crisis 21\n(1): 9–10. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/21/01/suffrage.html."

Its latest appearance is directed toward preventing Negroes from buying agricultural land, and against this last and most dangerous propaganda what honest American can withhold his influence and help?\nSecond—The attack on property is the natural child of the refusal of the right to work to Negroes. The year 1914 should see a determined attempt to break down the rules and customs which bar black men from labor unions and discriminate against them in other ways in their attempt to earn a living. The worst examples of this are in the contract labor laws of the South which virtually legalize peonage in agriculture. All of the advance labor legislation in the South specifically excepts “agriculture and housework!”\nThird—We might wait for all-healing time and reason in these economic difficulties if education was all right. But education for Negroes is awry, and our work for 1914 is to begin to right it. Under the guise of introducing “industrial” training the colored city public school has, first, been differentiated from the white system; secondly, shortened in length so as to end at the sixth and seventh grades, while the white schools have usually ten and twelve grades; and, finally, it is now openly proposed to so change the character of grade work that even the lower-grade work will not be concentrated on reading, writing and ciphering, but will teach Negroes to work, which, as Supervisor Guy, of Charleston, thinks, is more important than their learning to read. Of course the majority of Negroes in the country districts have no decent school facilities at all and here, surely, is work for 1914.\nFourth—The civil rights of Negroes need defense in 1914. The annoying and illegal race discrimination in the civil service, in hotels, restaurants, theatres, churches and Young Men’s Christian Associations must be squarely and frankly investigated and systematically opposed.\nFifth—The robbery of the Negroes’ political rights is the cause, and was intended to be the cause, of the invasion of the Negroes’ civil, educational and economic rights. Disfranchisement for race or sex must go, and the work of 1914 is flatly and fearlessly to restore democratic government in the South and overthrow the oligarchy which rests on the worst rotten borough system known to the modern world in civilized States.\nSixth—Finally, in 1914, the Negro must demand his social rights: His right to be treated as a gentleman when he acts like one, to marry any sane, grown person who wants to marry him, and to meet and eat with his friends without being accused of undue assumption or unworthy ambition.\nThis is the black man’s program for 1914, and the more difficult it looks the more need for following it courageously and unswervingly. It is not a radical program—it is conservative and reasonable.\nP. S.—The above statement was solicited by the Survey and accepted; then it was returned because the writer refused to omit number six!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nViolations of Property Rights (1911)\nThe Fruit of the Tree (1913)\nBlessed Discrimination (1913)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “Work for Black Folk in 1914.”\nThe Crisis 7 (4): 186–87. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/07/04/work_for_black_folk.html."

    "text": "We do not blame the people of the United States for being ashamed of lynching, but we have serious doubts if recent methods of curing the evil are going to be really efficacious. We do not refer now to the unjust and dangerous hastening of the trials of accused persons, nor even to the proposed lessening of the penalty for mob murder; but rather to an attempt, deliberate or unintentional, to suppress the truth concerning the present extent of lynching in this land.\nThe Crisisnoted this last year. The first reports suggested that only thirty-four persons had been lynched during 1912. The second report published in other papers raised the amount to fifty or more while The Crisis’ record was “sixty-three, possibly sixty-eight.”\nAs this, however, was our first attempt to keep a record, we let the matter go without comment; but we note for the year 1913 precisely the same phenomena, namely, an early syndicated report in certain papers with thirty-odd lynchings; next comes the Chicago Tribune, which has hitherto been looked upon as an authority on lynching statistics, and reports forty-four lynchings for the year. Then comes Mr. B. T. Washington’s report saying there were fifty-one.\nGod knows The Crisis is not anxious to increase the red record nor to revel in the spread of this most disgraceful blot upon our civilization. But nevertheless The Crisis has counted during the year 1913 seventy-nine and possibly eighty lynchings. There is, of course, much difficulty in determining just the number of lynchings. News agencies in the South often deliberately suppress these reports and in nearly all cases are vague as to names, places and details. It is always possible, therefore, that the same lynching may be reported twice; then, too, there is evident difficulty in determining what constitutes a lynching. Ordinary murders, even though by mobs, have usually not been included. Making all due allowances for these things, The Crisis is unable to see any reason for believing that lynching decreased last year. On the contrary, the evidence of a substantial increase seems very strong. We would be only too glad to have our conclusions disproved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLynching (1927)\nCrime and Lynching (1912)\nAnti-Lynching Legislation (1922)\nLynchings (1932)\nThe Lynching Industry (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “Lynching.” The Crisis 7\n(5): 239. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/07/05/lynching.html."

    "text": "The Western trip of the chairman of the board of directors was a clarion call to arms. To Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and Indianapolis went the cry which had already aroused black Washington as it was never aroused before. Mr. Spingarn told the people, colored and white, that the time had come for organization and work. The new abolitionism has come. Its workers are in the field and its voice is heard from St. Paul to New Orleans and from sea to sea.\nAlready the Bourbon press of the South, abetted by colored traitors in the North, is taking notice. The Richmond Times-Dispatch said in its leading editorial of January 12:\n\nSomeone has sent us a special number of a Negro monthly magazine, which appears to us to be about the most incendiary document that has passed through the mails since the anarchists’ literature was barred.\n&nbsp\nOn its title page this remarkable publication bears this legend: ‘Hereditary Bondsmen! Know Ye Not Who Would Be Free Must Strike the Blow?’ Answering its own question, the magazine proceeds to list some of the ‘blows’ valiant Negroes have struck, the race hatred they have aroused, the bloodshed they have precipitated, the insolence which has aroused so many against them. Altogether the array would be amusing were not its purpose so manifestly vicious.\n\nIt declares that fighting means razors and revolvers and fears that the whites of the South would be inclined to answer with ruthless repression and cruel injustice. All that has been gained in a generation for good will and peace would be sacrificed.\nIt then cites the recent Southern Sociological Congress as characteristic of the attitude of the South! On the contrary, that splendid congress is precisely the sort of fighting which we advocate, and there was not a Southern man in it who did not risk his bread and butter by speaking out.\nIt is the reactionary Bourbonism of the Times-Dispatch and its ilk that makes a great moral battle for a new abolition absolutely necessary in the land. The editor thinks that:\n\nThis particular magazine is of limited circulation, and is probably the organ of ambitious Negroes in New York. Its remarks, therefore, are scarcely worthy of consideration and its opinions beneath notice. But were this spirit to spread among the Negroes, we can but think how disastrous would be its workings.\n\nThe Crisis sold 32,000 copies of its January number, which is a larger circulation than the Times-Despatch has. And The Crisis renews the invitation to every American, black or white: Join or die. Join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Support its work, advocate its principles.\nIgnore the mischievous intimation of venal colored editors that we are “fighting” Booker T. Washington. We are fighting slavery, caste and cowardice in black men and white; nothing more and nothing less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRadicals (1919)\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nThe Macon Telegraph (1920)\nThe Next Step (1913)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “A Crusade.” The Crisis 7\n(5): 238–39. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/07/05/crusades.html."

    "text": "In the red blood-guiltiness of the Christian church in America toward black folk the Episcopal Church has undoubtedly larger share any other group. It was the Episcopal Church that for 250 years made itself the center and bulwark of man stealing and chattel slavery. It was the Episcopal Church that deliberately closed its doors in the face of the praying slave; it was the Episcopal Church that refused after the war to educate the freedmen, and is still refusing, and it is only on the rostrum of the Episcopal Church that such reactionary heathenism could find welcome expression as was uttered by the bishops of Georgia and Tennessee at the last general convention.\nThe setting was characteristic. In the Cathedral of St. John the Divine were gathered 1,000 persons, three-fourths of whom represented the emancipated and risen race whom the church for two centuries had insulted and spit upon. They were quiet, well bred and earnest people, long suffering and self-sacrificing. They did not complain when the obsequious ushers pushed them to the rear and carried forward the snobs and pretenders—the smug-faced hypocrites who are making the Episcopal Church in America a hissing in the ears of righteous men.\nThe dark hundreds sat down quietly and listened to—what? To a political screed, to lies that sounded deliberate, and to a wretched carping bitterness which disgraced the anointed prelates who thus fumed and cursed God and insulted their helpless auditors.\nIt is NOT true that the Fifteenth Amendment is the cause of the problems arising from the presence of the Negro race in America, and no student of American history with an ounce of sense or honesty would affirm this. As a matter of fact it was only the ballot of reconstruction times that kept the freedmen from re-enslavement.\nThere is not the slightest evidence that the South has spent $165,000,000 for Negro education, and yet this venerable lie, started in the senility of the late Commissioner Harris, was paraded again to salve the conscience of the guilty South.\nThe Atlanta University conference did NOT affirm the unmorality of most Negro preachers. It affirmed just the opposite, and the bishop of Tennessee made statements which sounded like deliberate falsification of the facts when he twisted a partial quotation out of its context to serve his own ends.\nThe American Negro does NOT stand in unusual need of moral training. It is the American white man who needs that. The American white man, and especially the white man of the South, is a thief and a libertine to a greater extent than the Negro ever was or ever will be, and it is an impudent thing to preach regeneration to the helpless victims of slavery and lust and stealing.\nWhy should the Episcopal Church in the day of its dotage thus elaborately set the stage to advertise Southern reactionaries? Why should it thrust forward Nelson and Gailor and leave in the background Dillard, Weatherby, Bishop and Peabody? Is not this but one of many signs which show that this great institution is the church of John Pierpont Morgan and not the church of Jesus Christ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCrime (1918)\nThe Church and the Negro (1913)\nSteal (1920)\nThe Church (1916)\nThe Methodist Church, North (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “The Episcopal Church.”\nThe Crisis 7 (2): 83–84. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/07/02/episcopal_church.html."

Large sums of money have recently been given to Southern white students to make studies of the American Negro. The original idea, started by the Phelps-Stokes Fund, was not so much the scientific accuracy of the results, as the effort to make young white Southerners seriously study the race problem at first-hand, according to modern methods. This idea had some justification; but since then, the majority of the recent studies of the American Negro have been made by Southern white students and are supposed to be carefully compiled scientific work. This also would have much to recommend it if the studies were indeed candid, thorough, and scientific. But when a Southern white man comes to the study of the race problem apparently with the idea of leaving out all “controversial” matter, and nevertheless calls the results scientific, then something is being done that is not only wrong but vicious."

His facts are usually true but he does not give all the facts, while his conclusions are grossly inadequate and incomplete.

    "text": "Agriculture\nFor instance, this report treats first of the Negro in agriculture. Now everybody knows, who knows anything about the South, of the main facts concerning the black peasant and farmer. It is not a question of praise or blame for the situation, or as to what we can do now to remedy it. But the facts are clear: in the country districts of the South the Negro farmer has no voice in his own government; he is taxed without representation; he has the poorest schools of any group in the United States; he is subject often to terrorism, mob violence and lynching; and over large districts he is in actual peonage. There can be no question about these conditions. The testimony is too universal. Or, if there is any doubt, the matter cannot be settled by ignoring the testimony, and the Rosenwald Fund should make a careful investigation into the facts.\nWithout speaking of schools, Mr. Woofter refers to the ignorance of the black farmers. Without speaking of caste and mob violence, he stresses the lack of leadership, when he must know that 3,500 Negroes have been lynched in the United States since 1882, and that the chief centers of lynchings are the small towns which dominate the country districts. Not once but thousands of times, Negroes of initiative, thrift and leadership have been driven out of the country districts of the South by cheating, threats and violence. Mr. Woofter makes no mention of this.\nHe speaks of credit—of its unwise and uneconomic use, just as if the Negro tenants had any choice in the matter. Negro farmers over wide areas in the Southern states are compelled to borrow, are compelled to pay exorbitant interest, are systematically misled and cheated in the sale of crops and seldom allowed to get out of debt to their landlords. This is a system so universal in the southern South that not to mention it, or to make it appear that the tenants’ one-crop credit system is due to sloth and stupidity, is deliberate deception.\nAfter the glossing of the plain truth, what is Woofter’s cure for depressed Negro agriculture?\n\nStrengthening agricultural education in the schools.\nStrengthening the work of farm demonstration agents.\nMore efficient use of the land.\nCo-operative marketing.\nBetter credit.\nLand buying.\n\nNot a word of education; of taxation without representation; of unjust arrest and mob violence; of cultural stagnation and death!\nThis is astonishing. Hampton, Tuskegee and a dozen well-endowed schools have been teaching agriculture, for a generation. Have they failed in their teaching? No, but their graduates who receive any beginnings of education had too much sense to return to the country districts of the South to fight a failing battle with the conditions which they knew they would find there. Consequently, there are fewer Negro farmers than ever, and land owning is beginning to wane; and all Woofter can ask is more teaching of agriculture and more intelligence from people without schools, and more ‘land buying’ by peons!"

The work has been advertised all over the world. The best teachers have been hired. Philanthropists have swarmed here to praise. And yet what is the result? The population of nearly 9,000 in 1900 has been decreased to 4,785 in 1928, and all indications are the rest are just slipping away as fast as they can. Why? Why is this the result of “farm demonstration work,” efficient “use of the land,” and “co-operation?” Woofter knows exactly what the trouble is in St. Helena. It is due to the concentration of the political power over five thousand Negroes, most of whom are landholders, in the exclusive control of only 25 white voters! This leads to over taxation; to public schools, which altogether cost only $2,500 a year for the whole island and to an economic life which is wholly dominated by the white capitalists of Beaufort and Charleston.\nIf there were on St. Helena Island, with Negro landholding peasants, good-hearted, hard-working and naturally intelligent people, a chance for self-government, universal education, and protection from hostile neighbors, who could doubt but that agricultural education, farm demonstration work and co-operation, would make here a model rural settlement? But to suggest that this can be done without political power; without public schools; and without law and order, is to suggest the impossible. And to call a study which does this scientific, is surely a misuse of terms.\nThere are many differences in different parts of the South, but over the whole South it is true that political, educational and economic conditions, beyond the control of the colored farmer, are the main cause of exactly the conditions which Woofter finds. He tells us “a decrease of 96,000 farms, between 1920–25, was almost entirely due to the movement of Negro farmers. Eighty-four thousand colored farmers and 12,000 white farmers were lost.”\nThere were 161,600 Negro owners in the Southeast in 1910, and only 145,900 in 1925, showing a “surprising proportion who are losing heart and moving to the city.”\n“It is depressing in the extreme to travel through many sections of the cotton belt where idle land stretches by the roadside for many miles and all houses are vacant.”\nWhy? For lack of “agricultural education?” Nonsense."

    "text": "Industry\nThe recommendations of this Report for the Negro in industry are not much more satisfactory. The conditions to which Mr. Woofter refers are fairly well-known. During slavery, the Negro supplied the household service and unskilled labor and very largely the semi-skilled and skilled labor of the South. In the North, he was a servant and laborer but only to a small extent a skilled worker because of the opposition of white workers. After the Civil War, he maintained a foothold as the servant and laborer of the South and as a skilled worker, particularly in the building trades and certain other industries. In comparatively small numbers, he entered the North as a common laborer and servant but here the opportunity to work was small because of the great migration of white workers from Europe. In skilled work, he was almost excluded by the attitude of the rising trade unions. Then came the World War, with its sudden stoppage of foreign migration and its great increase of certain industrial activities. Negroes poured into the North in a great stream to do not only common labor but a considerable proportion of semiskilled work and even of skilled work.\nThey secured a foothold in a number of important industries: the automobile industry, in the stockyards, in steel manufacture, in the making of clothing, in the mining industry, etc. They had a hard fight. They were in the situation of ignorant immigrants; they had to live in the worst and most unsanitary dwellings; they often met mob violence and discrimination and they were excluded not only from the unions which dominated the better paid trades, but also they met very often an attitude on the part of employers who would not hire colored labor under any circumstances and of workers who would not work with Negroes or would not endure them in anything but the lowest jobs."

    "text": "The Negro in the North\nDespite all this, the Negroes have won a foothold which they are maintaining. With their new and increased political power, they have not only secured new jobs but have protected themselves against race prejudice in the jobs which they have. They have bought an enormous amount of property and under great difficulties they are entering the business world in a small way and beginning to give employment to their own people.\nThese are well-known facts which Mr. Woofter confirms. What now is the obvious remedy for the betterment of this situation and for the encouragement of the economic development of the Negro? It is surely the opening up of wider industrial opportunities according to the demonstrated ability and skill and desert of Negro workers. They must have a chance to do what they can do; they must have a chance for promotion, according to their accomplishment and desert; and they must be paid the current rate of wages without discrimination. Their children should not only be in school but should receive encouragement and incentive to ambition, to train themselves for the best work for which they are naturally fitted. Every effort should be made to open up industrial opportunity for intelligent Negroes, to break down the discrimination of trade unions and to alter the attitude of many employers.\nThis, it seems to me, is the obvious path for the uplift of the Negro worker, North and South. What are Mr. Woofter’s recommendations? They are as follows:\n\nThe quota system for Mexican immigrants.\nDoing away with discrimination by the trade unions.\nVocational guidance.\nIndustrial education.\nEmployment offices.\n\nAt first glance, one might think that these recommendations cover most of the points mentioned; but a little further reading proves that they do not. He wants Mexican laborers excluded because they are in competition with the lowest grade of Negro common labor. But what are his proposals to raise the average grade of Negro labor by giving it opportunity at the top? He speaks of discrimination by trade unions and gives a list of unions which exclude Negroes. But he does not emphasize this. He asks for “more effective policy” for organizing Negro unions, and an “abatement” of discrimination; but he does not emphasize the fact that the greatest hindrance to the Negro worker in the North is the fact that under ordinary circumstances, no matter what his intelligence or skill, he cannot become a boiler maker, ship builder, machinist, railway worker of any grade except common labor, engineer, fireman, wire weaver, telegrapher, boot and shoe worker, electrical worker, photo-engraver, granite cutter, metal worker, plumber, or follow dozens of other trades. Into some of these trades he may slip by way of the open shop, or as a scab. Otherwise, he is excluded. Upon all this, Mr. Woofter lays little stress. He speaks of vocational guidance, but it is soon clear what he means by that. He means keeping the Negro in his place, curbing his ambition, preserving him, as in the Atlanta experiment which he lauds, as a domestic servant. There isn’t the slightest intimation in Mr. Woofter’s discussion that there are any numbers of Negro youth who have ability and talent for law, medicine and dentistry; for the work of the scientist and artist. He wants vocational guidance to dissuade colored children from the professions and “white-collar” jobs and to create in the mind of the Negro “a right attitude toward work.” He puts stress again on industrial education, apparently forgetting that he himself has furnished the strongest argument against industrial education, as it is now carried on by Negro schools."

    "section": "Industrial Training",
    "text": "Industrial Training\nFor twenty-five years, Negro industrial schools have been teaching industrial education. And in most of the very branches where they have been teaching, especially in building, bricklaying, carpentry, shoe-making, wagonmaking, and a dozen other lines, precisely in these lines Negroes have lost in numbers and status in the South.\nThis is proven by Mr. Woofter’s own testimony. He says, for instance, that Negro “carpenters have lost ground in skill and status.” In Macon, Georgia, “The Negroes have been losing ground very rapidly in practically all the trades.” In Raleigh, North Carolina, “white contractors no longer hire Negro carpenters.” In Charlotte, North Carolina, “Negroes have lost proportionally, as in the building trades.” What light does this throw on industrial training? Does it mean that all the time and money poured into Hampton, Tuskegee, into the state schools and in dozens of other industrial schools have been wasted and in vain? No. But it does mean that, first, the Negro industrial schools have been prevented from teaching the industries which would help the Negro worker; and secondly, there are other forces which Woofter ignores or does not connect with these facts which have been potent in driving out the Negro skilled worker. To illustrate: if industrial training among Negroes had been designed to increase their industrial efficiency and not merely to confine them to several trades already established, they would have been taught cotton-spinning in the cotton fields of Alabama; they would have been taught to run shoe-making machines, instead of doing cobbling by hand; they would have been taught the newer building trades, instead of confining them to carpentry, which is losing ground, even among the whites; they would have been taught the history of the labor movement and the principles of co-operation.\nBut all this was neglected. Industrial education was used to fix a closed industrial status upon the Negroes in the trades, the status of which has been changing or falling in significance. Moreover, in the new mass production, it is no longer a question of learning a skilled trade, but rather a matter of general intelligence and the opportunity of working in great co-operating groups. Here again the Negro has had no chance. And this fact, too, has handicapped him, when he is displaced, as he is so often, by machinery. Woofter tells of the displacement of Negro brickmakers, of skilled drillers, of workers in coke and puddling by machines. Under such circumstances, white workers have a difficult time, but they can turn to other trades and other occupations. The Negro does this with the greatest difficulty. One of these difficulties is his political disabilities in the South. His disfranchisement in voting leads to disfranchisement in working. Here again Mr. Woofter gives some testimony but makes no logical use of it. “In Raleigh, North Carolina, a white contractor employed Negro carpenters in 1915; he was called a Jim-Crow contractor; pressure was brought to bear on him by white carpenters, and he went bankrupt.”"

    "text": "Disfranchisement\nSo long as white workers come in competition with Negro workers, and have the ballot in their hands, while the Negro is disfranchised, they can force the Negro worker out of work. No amount of industrial training is going to overcome this difficulty.\nFor this reason, in Atlanta and New Orleans, Negroes have been driven out of their traditional work as garbage collectors. He speaks of political jobs gained by Negroes in the North but says no word of the fact that it is not these comparatively few jobs which are the real meaning of the Northern Negro’s political power; it is the additional fact that his political power keeps him from being ousted from many non-political jobs.\nThe author stresses the need of employment offices, but there again he misses the main point. What good are employment offices going to do if the opportunity for employment remains narrow or closed? Here are great industries, like Dennisons, the National Cash Register, Sears, Roebuck and Company, Filene’s, great organizations of commerce and industry throughout the United States, who not only employ large numbers of people, but have set certain standards as to wages and conditions for protection from unemployment, for wages and opportunities, for personal integrity, for a chance to show ability and to gain promotion. If organizations like this, without argument or investigation, simply refuse to hire persons, no matter what their talent or ability is, if they have a drop of Negro blood, how will the opening of employment bureaus remedy this case? In other words, more subtly but just as surely, Woofter’s remedies for the Negro industrial status deliberately miss the chief point of color discrimination and lack of Negroes’ opportunities."

    "text": "Domestic Service\nTo return to one point: Mr. Woofter, like any number of his ilk, stresses domestic service as a career for colored women. Industrial schools by the hundreds have been teaching “domestic science” to colored people for a generation, and the number of colored domestic servants has progressively declined and will decline. If white philanthropists really wish to make domestic service a modern vocation instead of a medieval caste, they could help organize it, raise its wages, shorten its hours, protect and dignify its workers, establish central offices, with careful inspection and standards of efficiency.\nIt may be said that colored people themselves ought to do this, but this requires experience and capital and influence, which few colored persons have had a chance to get. But in such a development of a new and self-respecting industry, Mr. Woofter is not interested. He is interested in the old “darkey” servant, paid low wages, working under conditions of personal subjection, which the working people of the world and of all colors are trying to repudiate. House service in the past, and particularly in the South, has been an open door to prostitution, concubinage and peonage. Every effort to make it appear attractive has failed and ought to fail. Southern people get poor Negro servants because only those who can do nothing else go into this work. What good servants need is not simply “domestic training”; they need a new economic status."

The real problem is not simply that of protecting Negroes from Mexican competition; it is not a vocational guidance which assumes that Negroes do not want to work and tries to force them into the lowest work with least wages and least protection; it is not simply industrial training as ordinarily understood, and it is not simply public employment bureaus.\nIt is, on the other hand, opening up opportunities at the top. It is giving the Negro the same wage as white men for the same work; giving the same chance for ability and promotion, and increased effort to bring a segregated Negro industrial group into modern American industry. On this aspect of Negro employment there is hardly any mention in the Woofter Report and certainly no emphasis.\nOne wonders just what the object of this report is. The figures and facts which it brings forth are perfectly well-known and have been collected and referred to a dozen times. There are practically no new facts, except a few unimportant local studies, and the results of some questionnaires, no more significant than a half-dozen others of this sort among Northern employers. But above all, there is an attempt not so much to say as to assume as for granted, the dictum that color prejudice, disfranchisement and poor schools, have nothing to do with the problem of the industrial colored employment in the United States.\nWe would like to ask Ira DeA. Reid, T. Arnold Hill, George Arthur and Benjamin F. Hubert, all colored men, and Alfred K.

    "text": "This is the speech made by the Editor of The Crisis when the Lieutenant Governor of the State of New York bestowed the 17th Spingarn Medal on Richard B. Harrison.\nThe investiture took place in Mansfield Theatre, New York, where “The Green Pastures” is beginning its second year’s run. There were present, the author and producer of the play, four Spingarn Medalists, the founder of the Medal and an audience of one thousand.\nMost of the audience applauded the speech, but there was a grim and critical group who quite evidently did not like it. What do you say?\nThis is peculiarly the occasion to say a word of the relationship between the theatre and the American Negro. The stage still retains among us something of freedom and the forward gaze. Behind the footlights one is permitted to examine and discuss Truth under circumstances where literature is stifled, painting inarticulate, sculpture choked of convention, architecture drowned in weaves of monstrosity and music fettered by death.\nBut this continuing freedom of dramatic art is due to no courage of managers nor merit of dramatists, and is threatened not only by the well recognized fat degeneration of musical comedy, but by that secret, internal and devastating malady which attacks an art which is free to treat in truth, and yet afraid to look it fair in the face. This is the present attitude of the American theatre as it faces the Negro.\n\nThe stranger from the stars bursting in upon earth today would, without shadow of a doubt or moment of hesitancy, fasten upon the plight of the black man in America as the most dramatic stuff of the modern world. Convict this harsh and heavy thrust of the dark and primitive peoples, out of the soft green and gold and clan tradition of the tropics, into the anarchy of the Reformation and French Revolution and the punishment of Victoria’s African territories fed on flesh across the whole Atlantic. The isles of the Caribbean shrieked to Boston and New Orleans; the Mississippi swept the white labor on black slavery and fought valley of black lowlands and Appalachians.\nNothing escaped it—neither religion nor philosophy, literature nor art, science nor government. Across a continent, across a world, the horror and tragedy and farce of this stupendous drama flew, and beside it men and women danced, and above it rolled a nerve-to-forgotten song. The souls of stricken millions descended into Hell and the third century arose again from the dead—with what blood and pricking pain—with such exquisite horror of hurt, as humanity has seldom known.\nEvery known element of human drama, every device of theatrical effect was here—the crucifixion of motherhood, the murder of children, the rape of homes; piteous debasement and nameless exaltation of the spirit of man. There was lacking no impudence of wealth nor depths of uttermost pits of poverty. There was the ding of whips, the fangs of dogs, the laughter of power, the refinement of cruelty and the sobbing abasement of the lowliest of the low—dragged slowly and bitterly and relentlessly out over endless years. This is the thing that today America makes merry over. It is our major amusement. It is material for clowns and braying jokes. It is our national perennial issue.\nYet for four hundred years of the fury fire and blood of this land’s history, wars black and crimson thread of a madcap hand wove end every pattern, and not the double tongues of all the Donnius and Charles Beard shall alter the red record of one jot of it.\n\nBefore this mightiest of human dramas, save here and there a lucid interval, the American theatre has sat distraught, dumb and stupid, with a vacant grin on its face: afraid of the truth, cowed by the tragedy, aghast at the very intricacy and endless implications of the plots. American playwrights have strained their inwards to submerge this drama into farce; to turn the piteous tragedy of the Negro into cheap pornographic bathos; to paint this all too human life into a degenerate reflection of their own sadistic desires. Until today on stage and in literature, in painting, in all art, save alone in music, the souls of black folk have been submerged in fetid filth and white pimps who finance and exploit black prostitutes in “Nigger Heaven” have quite concealed the blazing Hell beneath; and persuaded a complacent world that Harlem has no light of common day; that underneath our sale of laughter lie no pools of bitter tears.\nNot only has the American theatre refused to face the drama of the Negro problem, but it has opposed every effort of the Negro himself to find dramatic expression on the stage. It is not enough, in this great and free commonwealth of the spirit of man, that most training schools of drama and art are closed to black folk; it is not enough that in the annual nationwide radio audition no voice of an angel in a black skin may be heard; it is not enough that the American schools at Fontainbleau, supported by the leaders in American painting, sculpture and architecture, have sought to extend the American color line across France—all this perhaps must be tolerated and even awaited in arts dominated by money, by the private profit ideal and by cheap and smug convention. But in the freer air of the drama, despite its all too evident pandering to monopoly and the intellectual mob, it is astonishing to realize the fight which the black actor has had to gain the merest shadow of foothold on Broadway. No one is child enough to believe that a black skin makes an actor, or that the suffering of a people creates of itself the delicate art to portray it. But when the artist does appear, proven and clear, it is almost unbelievable that his fellow white artists would so long and so persistently deny him full recognition.\n\nWhen Europe of the early 19th Century recognized the great Jewess, Rachel, and the great Negro, Aldridge, as the two outstanding leaders of the stage, whom governments and science and art delighted to honor, that black man could not put foot on a single legitimate stage in the land of his birth. But even after slavery, and from 1870 down nearly to our day, the Negro actor could appear at Court only as the king’s fool, with cap and bells, with quip and joke, ready over his own heartbreak to guffaw lustily and dance fantastically for the massed amusement of morons. Even when the unchangeable logic of a particular plot demanded black characters, up until yesterday, even these parts must be taken by white folk with blackened faces, unknown dialect and an unusually dumb mental equipment. This nonsense in time went beyond the limit of New York complacency and today not even burnt cork could save a miserable play, although supported by the bad acting of the royal family.\nThis hesitancy of our freest form of art really to be free; this refusal of managers, playwrights and players to use normally and intelligently, the abundant stuff of dramatic material and the not infrequent genius in acting which a nation within a nation furnishes—a black nation greater than Ireland, Belgium, Austria or Portugal—a nation equal in numbers to Egypt, Persia, Czechoslovakia and all Scandinavia—this studied neglect of the most dramatic material in America, has already reacted and will react on the theatre in the United States. A freedom unused is perverted or lost. If the stage dare not frankly and fully portray the Negro problem because of fear and snobbery—because of a provincial mentality born of the slave oligarchy, spawned south of the Mason and Dixon line and transplanted to the congenial concrete sidewalks of New York—the American theatre will find itself with all the greater ease and easier logic denied the right to discuss sex and war, socialism and Russia, liquor and wealth, and anything which at any time an entrenched autocracy or a prurient puritanism or a Nordic impudence may guard with the shackles of censorship.\n\nThe abiding refuge of our optimism is the slow growth of normal dramatic instinct among us even anent the Negro; the slow expansion of a national receptive audience unafraid of racial problems. True it is that the fear still lurks; for the stage is still slow and the effective audience too small—and already something may have been eternally lost in creative genius, dramatic ability and the unhampered critical spirit; but “The Green Pastures” has helped our hope, and it has helped not so much in form and word and authorship as in the deft and subtle marvel of its interpretation. For skillful as the written play may be, the secret of its triumph lies in its interpretation by Negro actors, and above all in the high and delicate genius of Richard Berry Harrison.\nEven here an abundant satisfaction is haunted by a bleak memory. I have known Richard Harrison for thirty-five years. He stands before you tonight with smiling lips and the tranquil courage of a high heart. But I know—I know what crucifixion this man has suffered. Here is a white man of singular capacity and noble beauty who had a black great-grandfather. And who because of that fact and that alone—because of a truth he saw no reason to deny or conceal,—he has been given in this land of the free and home of the brave, from 1864-1930, sixty-six years, no real opportunity, no fair chance, no liberty for the genius that always lay in him, until 1930 and even then almost by accident.\nWhat the author of this play expected in its presentation, I do not know; but you and I know full well and of a certainty what the first audiences expected—what any average American audience expects when Negro actors appear in a Negro play. They expected amusement; they expected slap-stick and broad farce; they expected filth. They licked dry lips, for “The Green Pastures” of their imagination would be gaudy with food and fun, and of the Still Waters beneath they recked nothing.\nIf Richard Harrison had learned to dance clog and make faces in his youth, he might have riches now. But his demand for sincere drama, for the sting of tragedy and the high humor of true comedy, had led him long years face to face with hunger and poverty, straight on toward careless neglect. He was not one to complain. He has the high and African gift of laughter. He too has looked at death and smiled.\n\nAtlast the closed gate opened, so casually, so carelessly, that Harrison himself was not sure of what he saw—not sure it was The Gate. Someone was needed to portray God as a “nigger” minstrel on Broadway. But it had to be delicately done. There were churches and censors to avoid, there were susceptibilities to be soothed and creeds to be mollified. The audience must surely be tickled and amused, but its mirth must be in bounds, subdued to something like decorum at least in spots.\nThis called for subtlety in interpretation and understanding—for a deep and human knowledge of mankind, especially of that manner of men who live behind the veil of color, yet are men. Human beings, whether dark and singing slaves or white and bored seekers of Broadway pleasure, must on this stage, see God and live. Who could do this miracle of acting?\nWhen manager and playwright turned to find such a man they faced a wall. They knew few Negro actors. To Broadway the Negro was not an actor, he was a vaudeville turn. True it was that Charles Gilpin, by the tragedy of his own damnation had, with dying flair of genius and clairvoyance of O’Neill, forced the Negro defeatist psychology partially across the footlights. Half willingly thereafter, Broadway endured patronizingly Robeson and Rose McClendon for limited periods and with the clearly expressed proviso, that the author engage in the climax to kill the black hero, or destroy him or rend his soul from his body. Then the white audience could depart secure in the knowledge that all Negro aspiration and effort, by the very constitution of the universe, must ever end in annihilation and defeat, frustration and death.\nBut this climax would not suit “The Green Pastures.” Even on the American stage, God must be reasonably successful; and Richard Harrison almost as a last resort was offered the opportunity to try this role.\n\nWhat he accomplished, the nation knows. By the breadth of a hair and half-turn of a phrase—by a gesture and a silence, he guided a genial comedy into a great and human drama. Small wonder that only those who see the miracle, can gauge the genius of its doing or realize the rare perfection of its detailed accomplishment. The south, the west, which have not seen the actor and the play are curious and skeptical concerning it. With puzzled frown they inquire into its impression and results and shake vague heads. One can clearly understand how England, reading the text alone, can not escape the feeling that its content must either be blasphemy or farce. And yet no human soul witnessing a performance can doubt the lure of its human kindliness and the mighty tragedy beneath the deep and reverent guidance of a great actor.\nWhat you then as audience and two as authors have unleashed and unbound in this great soul—what you have freed and unfettered in a man and a race, is but earnest of what actors you may see and what drama you may evoke, if instead of hiding your heads in the sand and scurrying abroad to borrow for the American stage the second-hand situations of Paris and Vienna, you open purblind eyes and glance about you.\nThis meeting tonight is a tribute to Richard Harrison—a tribute belated and artificial, but none the less sincere. He is in his charm and courtesy, his tact and tolerant philosophy, one to be emulated and envied. Toward this distracting problem of race, he is far finer than many of his darker friends, for he walks without plaint or protest even in his hurt; while I, by God, front earth and high Heaven with insistent and unceasing clamor against this throttling of the Art of beauty, against this enchaining of the human spirit—against, to be sure, its cruelty and pain,—but even more, against its crass stupidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPrecept and Practice (1910)\nThe Fruit of the Tree (1913)\nDePriest (1929)\nThe Negro Politician (1928)\nNegro Writers (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1931. “Beside the Still Water.”\nThe Crisis 38 (5): 168–69. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/38/05/beside.html."

    "text": "This article was read before the National Inter-racial Conference at Washington, D. C., December 19, 1928. It is published here entire, with only verbal changes.\nWhat we know about the civil and political rights of Negroes in the United States; what significance this knowledge has for social organizations whose purpose it is to improve conditions; and what further study by universities and research organizations is called for, is the subject of this paper.\nOur general knowledge may thus be summarized: There is a system of color caste in the United States based on legal and customary race distinctions and discriminations, having to do with separation in travel, in schools, in public accommodations, in residence and in family relations. There is discrimination in the kind and amount of public school education and in civil rights of various sorts and in courts, jails and fines. There is disfranchisement of voters by means of various tests, including restrictions as to registration, and as to voting in primaries; and including the right of summary administrative decisions; and finally there is lynching and mob violence.\nOver against this there are the war amendments of the Constitution and various civil right laws of the states and the decisions of the courts in these matters.\nThe results of these discriminations have been pretty carefully studied in the case of education and lynching, but have received little systematic study in the matter of voting and civil rights.\nI doubt if it would be worth while to examine and expatiate on the general and pretty well-known facts of Negro citizenship and caste. I, therefore, pass to the matter of the significance of this general knowledge for social organizations whose purpose is to improve conditions."

    "text": "Afraid of Facts\nWe are confronted not simply by lack of exact data but by a clear disposition not to investigate or even to discuss. I know of no organization that has ever proposed to study Negro suffrage.\nI distinctly remember when this recoiling from the facts covered other fields. There was a time when social studies, having to do primarily with the health, physique and growth of the Negro population, were of pressing importance because of the widespread assumption that the Negro was not adapted to the American climate or to conditions of life under freedom and that he was bound sooner or later to die out.\nIt was necessary, therefore, to test by such scientific measurements as were available these assumptions. Yet for a long time universities and social organizations refused to touch the matter and philanthropists refused funds and encouragement when Atlanta University attempted its wretchedly restricted pioneer work. Times changed. Today, tests and measurements have gone so far that there is no further question of the survival of the Negro race in America and the physical studies connected with him are no different and demand no different technique or organization from the general physical studies carried on in the nation. The real question narrows down to matters of sanitation, hospitals and income. What has Negro suffrage to do with these?\n \nAgain, between the years 1890 and 1910, the right of the American Negro to modern education had to be established and proven. It was assumed that the ability of the Negro to assimilate a college education was at least questionable; and it was dogmatically stated that the economic future of the Negro in America was such that all that he needed was industrial training to make him a contented laborer and servant; that this class of people did not need political power and could not use it; but that on the contrary their disfranchisement would free the South so that it could divide its vote on pressing political matters; and that the South could be depended upon to guard the rights of this working caste.\nThe fight was bitter and long drawn out. Those of us who insisted that in modern industrial life no laboring class could maintain itself without educational leadership and political power were assailed, put out of court, accused of jealousy, and of an overwhelming desire to promote miscegenation.\nToday finds the educational part of our contention answered by facts. We have twelve thousand college students, where we had less than one thousand in 1900, and we are graduating today annually 1500 Bachelors of Art, when in 1900 we sent out less than 150. It is admitted now without serious question that the American Negro can use modern education for his group development, in economic and spiritual life.\nThere is, however, still the feeling that the present problems of Negro education are problems of charity, good will, self-sacrifice and double taxation and not problems which depend primarily for their final solution upon political power.\nSo, too, in the matter of housing, recreation and crime, we seem to assume that a knowledge of the facts of discrimination and of the needs of the colored public are sufficient, with faith, hope and charity, to bring ultimate betterment; and that in presenting demands to the government of city, state and nation, we have only to prove that Negro poverty, disease and crime hurt white citizens in order to induce the lawmakers elected by white citizens to do justice to black citizens."

    "text": "Political Power\nIn the matter of occupation and income the need of political power in any laboring class is conceded by every social student; for the American Negro or his friends to dream that he can sustain himself as a peasant proprietor, an artisan or day laborer, and secure recognition from his organized voting white fellow worker and a decent wage from his employer, without a vote, is extraordinary. It is a conceded impossibility in every modern land.\nWe can point with some pride to what has been accomplished in the courts in breaking down caste and establishing Negro citizenship, and in the abolition of mob law and lynching. But we are still uncertain in estimating the cause and effects of such actions.\nI have heard a number of plausible and attractive explanations of the decline of lynching from 226 in 1896 to 11 in 1928. Some attribute it to prayer, and others to inter-racial resolutions; but I see it differently. I see lynching increase and decrease indifferently, until in 1919 a nationwide agitation was begun by the N.A.A.C.P., backed by statistics, advertisements and meetings. The curve of mob murder fell lazily. Then suddenly in a single year it dropped 75%. I study the occurrences of that year, 1922. And that study leads me to believe that the effective check to lynching was the organized political power of Northern Negroes that put the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill through the House of Representatives January 26, 1922, by a vote of 230 to 119."

The only way that the South accomplished its defeat was by refusing to allow the government of the United States to function. Knowing that such high-handed measures were going a bit too far, the South promised to stop lynching and it has pretty nearly kept its word. And yet consider the cost: there has not been in Poland or in Haiti, in Russia or in the Balkans, a more open, impudent, and shameless holding up of Democracy than the senators of the Bourbon South, holding office on the disfranchised Negro vote, accomplished in November, 1922.\nThe success which we have had before the courts in abolishing the hereditary right to vote which the “Grandfather” clauses bestowed on white Southerners; the fight against segregation in residence and its spread in schools; the fight against the white primary and numerous Civil Rights cases have not simply been brought to successful issue because of our present small but increasing political power, but are without significance unless they point to fuller political power.\nI do not for a moment argue that political power will immediately abolish color caste, make ignorant men intelligent or bad men good. We have caste and discrimination in the North with the vote and social progress in some parts of the South without it. But there is this vast difference: in states like New York where we are beginning to learn the meaning and use of the ballot we are building a firm and unshakable basis of permanent freedom. While every advance in the South unprotected by political power is based on chance and changing personalities and may at any time be vetoed by a hostile voting group. I maintain that political power is the beginning of all permanent reform and the only hope for maintaining gains."

    "text": "The Negro Vote\nThere is today a surprisingly large number of intelligent and sincere people, both white and black, who really believe that the Negro problem in the United States can ultimately be solved without our being compelled to face and settle the question of the Negro vote.\nNearly all of our social studies apparently come to this conclusion, either openly or by assumption, and do not say, as they ought to say, and as everyone knows in the long run they must say, that granted impulse by philanthropy, help by enlightened public opinion, and the aid of time, no permanent improvement in the economic and social condition of Negroes is going to be made so long as they are deprived of political power to support and defend it.\nNowhere else in the world is there any suggestion that a modern laboring class can permanently better itself without political power. It may be a question, it certainly is a question, as to just how labor is going to use this power ultimately so as to raise its economic and social status. But there is no question, but that such power must be had and today the world over it is being used.\nWith all the research that has gone on formerly, and especially in the last few years with regard to the American Negro, with singular equanimity, nothing has been said or done with regard to the Negro vote. I am, therefore, stressing in this paper the significance and the danger of this omission and I am seeking to say that of all the questions that are before us today that of political power on the part of the American Negro occupies, to my mind, the key position, and is the question which peculiarly tests the good faith of the American people, the honesty of philanthropy in America toward the Negro, and the sincerity of the National Inter-racial Conference."

    "text": "A Debate\nI listened yesterday with mounting astonishment to a discussion of school betterment in the South. I am convinced that in no other civilized country in the world could such a discussion have taken place. The crucial problem was that of raising local funds for schools and of having the National Government supplement those funds in the poorer states: and the essential point in the whole matter was surely the selection of local officials who would spend the money as the local voting population wished; would raise funds by local taxation fairly placed on local wealth and would expend National monies equitably. In any other land the first point of the debate would have been the question of the selection of such proper officials and of the democratic control of their actions.\nThat question in the debate to which I listened was never raised. It was assumed that, although there were to be separate schools for Negroes, Negroes were to have no voice in the selection of local officials, no control of their own taxation, no vote on expenditure; and that despite this through philanthropy and good will you were going to get and maintain a decent and adequate school system for them.\nIf the present rulers of Russia had heard this debate they would have gone into gales of laughter; and if any government had attempted to carry on a debate on these lines in the English Parliament, the German Reichstag or the French Chamber of Deputies, the government would have been thrown out forthwith. Every Englishman, Frenchman and German would have said, without qualification, that education today can not be carried on as a matter of philanthropy and good will: that it is the duty of the State and that back of the State must stand some effective democratic control."

The United States is the one great country of the world where wealth is escaping taxation and where the burden of public contributions that falls upon the farmer, the small householder, the laborer and particularly the black laborer is crushing in its incidence; and yet how little is said of drafting by universal suffrage sufficient wealth for the public good to pay every reasonable expense and of putting the people, black and white, back of such draft.\nI hold this truth to be self evident, that a disfranchised working-class in modern industrial civilization is worse than helpless. It is a menace, not simply to itself, but to every other group in the community. It will be diseased; it will be criminal; it will be ignorant; it will be the plaything of mobs, and it will be insulted by caste restrictions.\nSo far we are upon old ground. This argument has been urged many times in the past. It has failed to impress the people of the United States simply because so many folk do not care about the future of American Negroes. They once almost hoped that the problem would be settled by the Negroes dying out or migrating, or bowing in dumb submission to any kind of treatment that the people of the United States decided to give them.\nBut, today, the matter is changed, and it is changed because those Americans who have any ability to see and think are beginning slowly to realize that when Democracy fails for one group in the United States, it fails for the nation; and when it fails for the United States it fails for the world. A disfranchised group compels the disfranchisement of other groups. The white primary system in the South is simply a system which compels the white man to disfranchise himself in order to take the vote away from the Negro.\nThe present extraordinary political psychology of the Negro in the South; namely that the voluntary disfranchisement of intelligent and thrifty black men is helping to solve the Negro problem, is simply putting into the hands of scoundrels and grafters white and black the meagre remains of those political rights which 200,000 black civil war soldiers fought to gain."

But it is not simply that the Negro remains a slave as long as he is disfranchised, but that Southern white laborers are dragged inevitably down to the Negro’s position, and that the decent white South is not only deprived of decent government, but of all real voice in both local and national government. It is as true today as it ever was that the nation cannot exist half slave and half free.\nToday, in the South, politicians have every incentive to cut down the number of voters, black and white. The Republican organization, in nine cases out of ten, becomes simply the tail to the Democratic kite. Party government disappears. Political power is vested in the hands of a clique of professional politicians, white and black, and there is nothing that has been done in dirty politics by Tammany in New York, by Thompson in Chicago, or Vare in Philadelphia, that you cannot find duplicated by the political oligarchies which rule the Southern South.\nPolitical ignorance in the South has grown by leaps and bounds. The mass of people in the South today have no knowledge as to how they are governed or by whom. Elections have nothing to do with broad policies and social development but are matters of the selection of friends to lucrative offices and punishment of personal enemies. Local administration is a purposely disguised system of intrigue which not even an expert could unravel.\nToday, a small group of Western Congressmen, to the dismay of East and South, are investigating the sale of offices by black Republicans in the South; but offices from the highest to the lowest have been regularly sold by white Republicans and white Democrats in the South and are being sold today.\nAnd yet, of all this, there must be no criticism, no exposure, no real investigation, no political revolt, because decent white South lacks the moral courage to expose and punish rascals even though they are white and to stand up for democracy even if it includes black folk.\nI yield to no man in my admiration for what the new young South is doing in liberalizing race relations and humanizing thought, but I maintain that until the liberal white south has the guts to stand up for democracy regardless of race there will be no solution of the Negro problem and no solution of the problem of popular government in America. You cannot build bricks of molasses.\nNor is this all. Because of the rotten boroughs of the South, real Democratic government is impossible in the North. The Democratic Party cannot become a liberal body because the bulk of its support depends upon disfranchisement, caste and race hate in the South. It depends on minimizing participation in politics by all people, black and white, and stifling of discussion. It is the only part of the nation where the woman suffrage amendment is largely ignored and yet the white women do not dare to open their mouths to protest.\nSo long as this party holds this grip on 114 electoral votes despite argument, with no reference to dominant political questions and with no reference to the way in which votes are actually cast, this party cannot be displaced by a Third Party. With no Third Party corrective for a discredited minority, democratic government becomes simply impossible without something resembling revolution."

It is too well-known for me to comment. I only remind the reader that the right of Southern white men to vote as they wished on public questions was openly and vehemently denied and the right of dominant political cliques holding their power by disfranchising four million white and black voters, to make their own election returns as to the vote cast, without state or national investigation or inquiry, was successfully maintained. This is the only modern nation in the world which does not control its own elections."

It is not a question of the millennium; of being able through democratic Government to do everything immediately. But it is a question, and a grave and insistent question, whether the United States of America is going to maintain or surrender democracy as the fundamental starting point of permanent human uplift. If democracy is still our corner stone, must it be smashed because of twelve million Negroes? Better cut their throats quickly and build on.\nOn the other hand, if Democracy fails in the United States, and fails because of our attitude toward a darker people, what about Democracy in the world, and particularly in India, in China, in Japan and in Egypt? We have got a chance today, and an unrivaled chance, again to rescue and guide the world, as we did at the end of the 18th Century. And we have the same kind of dilemma.\nIn those days when we started to build a nation of equal citizens, Negro slavery could have been abolished; its abolition was begun even in the South; but the respectable people, the smug people, sat down before it and organized the American Colonization Society, which was the interracial movement of that day; and instead of fighting evil they were content to congratulate themselves on the good already accomplished. In the long run, they did less than nothing.\nSo today it is fortunate that people can sit down at Interracial Conferences and find so much to congratulate themselves about in the improved relation between races, and the increased knowledge which they have of each other. But all of this is going to be of no avail in The Crisis approaching unless we take advantage of the present desire for knowledge and willingness to study and willingness to listen, and attack the main problem which is and has been the question of political power for the Negro citizens of the United States.\nI do not for a moment minimize the difficulty of inaugurating in a land but a generation removed from slavery, of universal suffrage which includes children of slaves. It is extraordinarily difficult and calls for patience and tolerance. But my point is that the sooner we face the goal the quicker we will reach it. We are not going to make democracy in the South possible by admitting its impossibility and refusing to study and discuss the facts. Let us first of all say, and broadcast the fact, that all Americans of adult age and sufficient character and intelligence must vote and that any interference with or postponement of this realization is a danger to every other American—a danger to be attacked now and continuously and with dogged determination with a clear avowal of intention by every open-minded man.\nWhat then is called for? Facts. A foundation of actual fact concerning the political situation of Negroes; their voting, their representation in local, state and national government; their taxation, their party affiliation and subserviance to political machines; the economic nexus between political power and occupation and income.\nThis study beginning with Negroes should extend to whites. We must lift the curtain from democracy and view it into the open. We must insist that politics is no secret, shameful thing known only to ward heelers and political bosses, and to the corporations who buy and sell them. Here is the greatest and most insistent field of scientific investigation open to the social reformer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nColor Caste in the United States (1933)\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Race Segregation (1934)\nThe Social Equality of Whites and Blacks (1920)\nEducation (1930)\nSocial Equality (1928)"

Indeed, for centuries it was the main justification for that slavery on the consciences and lips of Christians.\nBut careful inquiry among missionary societies reveals today an astonishing state of mind. For instance, in the case of the African Inland Mission: “The question has never been raised.” The United Missionary Society says: “The matter has not come before the Board.” The Foreign Missionary Society of the United Brethren-in-Christ has “not made it a practice to send out American Negroes”; the American Friends Board of Foreign Missions has “never formulated any policy concerning the sending to Africa of American Negroes as missionaries”; the Foreign Mission Board of the Brethren-in-Christ, “have not had any applicants”; the Women’s General Missionary Society of the United Presbyterian Church has “never discussed the matter”; the Missionary Society of the Evangelical Church has “no policy!”\nOn the other hand, the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention is frank: “Our policy is not to send American Negroes as missionaries”; also, the Sudan Interior Mission has a policy, and states it plainly: “Our brethren from the American Negro churches practically have to live on the same plane almost as their white brethren, and this creates a problem”; the American Bible Society scents some trouble and hastens to say: “I presume your inquiry is evoked by some thought that there may be racial discrimination asserted by the missionary agencies of the churches selecting missionaries. I have been more or less closely associated with missionary work in the last ten years and have never known of such a case.” Thus writes Mr. Eric North, who evidently does not dwell on earth but in a Heaven of his own.\nMost of the missionary societies who try to apologize for their discrimination seek to explain their stand by saying that they are training “native” helpers. Certainly, this should be true. But why not use American Negroes as the obvious instruments for such training? The Presbyterian Church began sending Negro missionaries and then stopped. Only this year have they finally been induced to send two. The American Baptist Foreign Mission Society tries to put the whole onus upon Negro churches, and declares that “no qualified Negro applicants” have applied in recent years. If they should apply, the Society does not promise to send them, but only to give the matter “most careful consideration.” The Women’s General Missionary Society of the United Presbyterian Church says that “no action for or against the sending of Negroes to work as missionaries in Africa has been taken. I can see complications that might be unpleasant and hard to surmount.” The Friends and others also admit the fact that several foreign governments, and especially the Belgian Congo, object to American Negroes.\nAs a matter of fact, missionary societies of the United States started out, for the most part, with the obvious policy of sending Negroes to convert Africa. Then they found out that this involved social equality between white and black missionaries; the paying of Negro missionaries on the same scale as white missionaries, and their promotion and treatment as civilized beings. With few exceptions, American white Christianity could not stand this, and they consequently changed their policy. Several of them stopped sending Negroes, altogether. Others tried to get their assistance from the natives, where discrimination in treatment and wages could be made without complaint; while still others intimated, as the American Baptist Foreign Missionary Society puts it: “The failure of quite a proportion to live up to their all important moral obligations has necessarily been a serious consideration,” which is a chaste way of saying that American Negroes are too immoral to convert Africans to the kind of Christianity which this Society has for sale.\n\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1929. “Missionaries.” The Crisis. 36(5):168.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Methodist Church, North (1911)\nCrime (1918)\nThe Church and the Negro (1913)\nSteal (1920)\n‘Social Equality’ (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1929. “Missionaries.” The Crisis\n36 (5): 168. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/36/05/missionaries.html."

    "text": "Nothing is more dangerous than unintelligent optimism; childish faith in the triumph of good; the “God’s-in-His-Heaven” attitude, assumed because one is too lazy to be worried. On the other hand, the worst moral dyspepsia must face facts; and looking back on the history of the Negro race in America for the last few years one cannot help feeling a sense of tremendous encouragement.\nThe legal defense of black men instead of being sporadic and occasional is taking definite, determined form and it is becoming increasingly difficult to cheat and oppress and mob colored people simply because they are colored.\nBut this, after all, is merely negative. Yet on the positive side there is even greater cause for self-congratulation. There is a new self-assertion which is not merely empty impudence. Quietly and unswervingly Negroes have laid down the law that their higher institutions of learning can no longer be run regardless of colored folk’s ideals and desires. Again Negroes have begun to undertake their own self interpretation and are no longer content merely to sit by, smiling delightedly, when some white outsider carelessly evaluates their history, their song, their hopes, their personal appearance.\nFollowing a rather sudden, almost hysterical renaissance of art among them, there is slowly coming a determined Will-to-Create. Self-expression wells up among us even though it is not all of the highest order, and often lacks careful finish; it is nevertheless a true and sincere mirroring of new souls and valuable because of its sincerity and newness.\nIn the economic field one senses in every part of the country, better home life, larger incomes and more careful spending. The old ideal of imitating the extravagance of rich whites has not altogether passed but it is evidently passing. One finds little homes of cultured colored folk who are quite willing to admit that they are living on one hundred dollars a month and really living. Children are crowding into high schools and colleges not simply because it is the thing to do but because their parents are getting clear ideas of just what education is for. There is a small new army of colored artisans who know the technique of their work and of the labor movement. And finally, in the dull brain of white America it is beginning to become clearly evident that the most virile future force in this land, certainly in art, probably in economics and possibly in science is the Negro.\n\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1929. “Optimism.” The Crisis. 36(5):168.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOptimism (1927)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\nCounsels of Despair (1934)\nA Statement (1919)\nThe White Church (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1929. “Optimism.” The Crisis 36\n(5): 168. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/36/05/optimism.html."

    "text": "We have received the following letter from Margaret Deland, the well-known writer:\n\nI remember with great pleasure meeting you very many years ago at the house of my friend, Mrs. Evans, in Boston. I recall that William James was there also, and that we four had a delightful time. As I have always been profoundly interested in the political, industrial and spiritual welfare of the people who were so deeply wronged some three hundred years ago, I am keenly alive to the advancement of Negro Americans to-day.\n\nSo, remembering your good nature in answering the questions I asked that day at Mrs. Evans’, I am venturing to send you the enclosed clipping in regard to the election to Congress of Oscar DePriest. I have a feeling that few things would be so impressive to persons who desire not only justice, but spiritual advancement, for the colored people, as to have a colored man of your eminence protest against the political advancement of any persons of his race who does not display intellectual and moral integrity. Of course, the same protest should be made to the political advancement of any unethical white man—and, as we both know well, there have been many opportunities for such protest! But political indignation expressed against white scoundrels, in papers conducted by white men—desirable as such expression of opinion is—can not draw forth the same approval, as that same indignation expressed against an unethical colored man, in a magazine such as The Crisis.\n\nI am sure that you will see my point in this, and I most earnestly hope that The Crisis will repudiate this man in no uncertain terms.\n\nThe Crisis regrets that it cannot do this. On the contrary, it congratulates Oscar DePriest upon his election. We do not approve of all that Mr. DePriest has done in the past and probably shall not approve of much that he will do in the future, but we do know that Oscar DePriest stands solidly and unwaveringly for the following things:\n\nThe enforcement of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.\nThe passage of the Dyer-Anti Lynching Bill.\nThe abolition of the “Jim-Crow car in interstate commerce.\nThe abolition of color segregation and discrimination in the Civil Service of the United States.\n\nWe wish that in addition to this, Mr. DePriest believed in clean politics; in the smashing of Big Business, bootlegging and crime in their present alliance for political power; and in the organization of political life in Chicago so that the intelligent will of the majority could be openly and efficiently expressed.\nWe wish that Mr. DePriest stood for these things, but we acknowledge with bowed head that if he had stood for such a program as this he never would have been Congressman from Illinois. In other words, the only organized interests in the United States who could be induced to send a colored man to Congress or any man who stands for the five things outlined above, are the same interests which are allied with the rule of wealth and crime.\nWe find ourselves compelled in political life, therefore, to choose the least of evils. If we remember that Senator Borah stands for clean politics, we also are compelled to remember that he stands for the disfranchisement of Negroes; that he did not vote for the DyerAnti Lynching Bill, and that he has grown dumb in the fight for Haiti. We would like to admire Al Smith because of the high level of his appointments to office, and his fight against the power trust. But we are compelled to vote against him because never in all his career has he given the slightest attention to the American Negro or expressed the slightest interests in his problems. We support Oscar DePriest, therefore, for the same reasons that we oppose Borah and Smith, namely: the things that DePriest stands for are more vital to the future of democracy in America than prohibition, crime and privilege. Given democracy in this land and we can fight drunkedness, prostitution and monopoly; without democracy and with a “Solid South” we can only wobble between Hoover and Raskob.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSocial Equality (1916)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nThe White Church (1917)\nOptimism (1929)\nAgain, Social Equality (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1929. “DePriest.” The Crisis 36\n(2): 57. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/36/02/depriest.html."

Perhaps the institution feels a bit new and self-conscious and over-eager, and yet it is genuine. It has buildings, good-class rooms, and a teachers’ home that is homelike. It needs a library.\nI am confirmed in my feeling that the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute at Petersburg is a well-run institution. It has, for instance, one of the best school libraries that I know: a library that is not a miscellaneous collection of old books, but a new thing planned and bought for use and used. It is building the most complete set of student dormitories that I saw in my journey. And what it needs, as so many institutions need, is some method of getting rid of buildings already there.\n\nWhat shall one do with an old building? The great central hall at Petersburg is a monstrosity. It ought to be sunk into a deep hole and covered up. A general destruction at Shaw would be an improvement. Johnson Smith could spare a couple of buildings, and so can Allen at Columbia. Bethune-Cookman, Waters, Haines, Atlanta and Fisk have all one or two or more buildings that need to be burned.\nBut to go back to Petersburg. It moves like clockwork. The curriculum is complete and all-embracing in its theory, and yet, do I not seem to feel a little too much machinery, a certain lack of spontaneity and initiative on the part of the students? The student audience did not have the same air of intelligence that I found in many other places."

He promised to hire one, but could not. Nevertheless, it mattered little. The roads were excellent and the Principal himself owns two autos: a Cadillac and a new Ford. He sent his chauffeur with me and we made the trip in an hour and a half, with an expenditure of less than three gallons of gas, and the Principal charged me Ten Dollars for the courtesy! The next time I go to Fayetteville I shall walk."

There were roses in my room.\nAllen, at Columbia, had again an unusually intelligent and attentive audience. It occupies a whole city square, with many good-looking buildings. Four modest and rather pretty girls sang Negro folk songs. But they sang them with quavers, and_ halftones, and succeeded in taking every shred of melody, even out of “Steal Away.”\nI spent a Saturday off at Jacksonville with Colonel Floyd, but that is another story and a long one.

It is on exhibition and numbers of tourists pour in to see it of a Sunday. I was distressed to find my student audience behind me singing, instead of in front of me listening. I think next time I shall turn my back to the audience. But the institution has been built and planned by the indominable energy of one black woman and her enthusiastic spirit inspires it and makes it live. The students are unexpectedly alive. I talked with those in the Junior College, all alone and cosily sequestered in the Principal’s parlor with no teachers there. Goodness! but they walked into things. There were no hesitations or reticences. They started right out with social equality, racial intermarriage, companionate marriage, the sex morality of the younger generation, occupations, and so on. It was a breathless living hour, and quite worth going to Florida for.\nI come back again to the extraordinary vitality and eagerness, the curiosity and intellectual freedom of these new colored students. It is beyond that of the white students that I have been talking to in numbers of Northern institutions. And I presume it is more vital because it reflects a freedom but very recently gained and not yet quite recognized. Some of the teachers rather look to me like hens with ducklings and I am sure that teachers and principals were several times on the edge of apology when | hurried to forstall them by some remark. As compared with the colored student body which I knew and bullied as a teacher and which I have seen in vague glimpses during the last twenty years, I should say that since 1920 intellectual revolution had struck the colored college student; and trustees and teachers had better yield gracefully. Indeed this is what they show many signs of doing.\n\n\n\nTapley Hall, Spelman College, as Seen Through the Pillars of Sisters Chapel."

    "text": "Jim-Crow\nI rode to Augusta, starting early. This riding in the South is interesting. From New York to Sedalia, 463 miles, I went in a Pullman. After reaching the South I traveled in a Pullman, 190 miles back to Virginia—and then 275 miles from Columbia to Jacksonville; 166 miles from Atlanta to Tuskegee and 205 miles from Birmingham to Nashville.\nIn all these cases, however, special and careful arrangements had to be made. Friends of mine who knew some white persons or officials of importance, had to intercede and conduct subtle negotiations. Where the matter was a night ride, as from Greensboro to Petersburg, Columbia to Jacksonville, and Birmingham to Nashville, the matter was arranged with a certain secrecy and ease. After all, the white folk did not see their dark passenger until morning had dawned, and he was already there. And in most cases, even then, they said nothing. Indeed, at Petersburg, they were quite polite, and at Jacksonville and Nashville, they bore up without comment, so far as I could see. The matter of the day ride from Atlanta to Tuskegee, was of course much more grave. I paid $6.30 to ride in the drawing room. If I had been white, I could have ridden in some of the empty seats of the main car at a cost of less than $2.00.\nOn the “Jim Crow” car I rode frequently and at length. From Petersburg to Raleigh,190 miles, over the Seaboard: the Negro coach was half of a smoker and not as modern a coach as that of the whites. It was, however, clean and the conductor said “please” when he asked for tickets. This is a decided improvement over ten years ago. The news boy, or rather the news old man, was unobtrusive and kept in his place. From Selma to Fayetteville, I rode fifty miles on a separate coach, old and empty. From Hamlet to Charlotte I rode seventy miles over the Seaboard in a miserably dirty car which any decent State Board of Health would have condemned.\nFrom Charlotte to Columbia I was on the Southern in a fairly clean coach, but very slow and roundabout, taking nearly six hours to go 108 miles. From Jacksonville to Charleston, I not only could get no Pullman for the all-day ride of nearly three hundred miles, but I could not even get a ticket on the nine o’clock train, which was the fast train, and connected with Charleston by coach. I must go on the 9:05, which took an hour longer!\nI remembered of old that ride from Charleston to Augusta, five hours for 150 miles. From Nashville, north, there were difficulties about certain crack trains. The Noon train which makes only one stop to Bowling Green was all Pullman. I could not go on that. I had to take the half past eleven train, which occupied three hours instead of two. From Bowling Green to Cincinnati, had I been white, I should have taken the 10:41, arriving bright and rested, at 8:00 A.M. As it was, I started the next morning and took the 9:46, having an all-day ride of 231 miles, looking out at principally nothing, from an almost empty car.\nMy chief joy in these “Jim Crow” rides was these empty cars. The automobile is certainly bringing just retribution upon the silly profiteering of Jim Crow. All over and everywhere the colored people are traveling in their automobiles. They took me from Raleigh to Selma, sixty miles, by auto; from Fayetteville to Hamlet, sixty miles; from Jacksonville to Daytona, and back, 200 miles; from Tuskegee to Talladega, 95 miles, and from Talladega to Birmingham, 121 miles; five hundred and thirty-six miles by auto, and only my lack of time kept me from increasing this. By auto, of course, we avoided all sorts of things: the waits for tickets in the depot; at Charlotte, the ticket agent served every single white person at the white window before he came around to the colored window. I must have stood for fifteen minutes. The matter of food and luncheons was, of course, made easy. In fact, the only discriminations that we chanced upon was one at which we heartily laughed: a filling Station on the Jacksonville-Daytona road had a sign “For white trade only.” We passed it four times and saw no single car there. “These Crackers persist in being fools!” says my companion.\nEspecially is the automobile a boon for the colored Bishops, the officials of fraternal societies, insurance agents, and the like. I remember once that the venerable Bishop Turner stricken with paralysis, could for neither love nor money, hire a Pullman berth from Savannah to Atlanta. They fixed the old man up in the “Tim Crow” smoker across two seats. Yesterday, I saw the African A. M. F. Bishop of Florida. He was gliding along in his Cadillac car with a chauffeur on the way from Jacksonville to Atlanta. He looked extremely comfortable."

    "text": "Augusta and Atlanta\nAugusta shows a sort of dogged stagnation. It is the home of rich Northern golfers, grim cotton mills, and disinherited black folk. For fifty years it has refused any substantial improvement to its Negro schools and the Negro section still has its unpaved _ streets. Increasing _ poverty among the poor white folk is leading to every effort among the well-to-do whites to displace Negro labor. In fact, this movement is characteristic of the Southeast. It is perhaps widest in Florida, where the whites have poured in from Georgia and Alabama, like a plague of locusts. Wherever they could get a Negro’s job by legislation or mob violence, they did so. The Negroes underbid them only by semi-servile work, as for instance, when white women of Jacksonville canvassed the business center for white truckmen; it was revealed that the colored truckmen not only drove their trucks, but loaded and underloaded them; which, of course, no lordly white men would be expected to do! So in Augusta, the colored people are fighting for lowly jobs.\nHaines Institute looked grey and slow. Its guiding genius still sits within, sedate and firm, and lonesome. Yes, Lucy Laney looks lonesome. Haines calls for new blood and new blood means new money. ’There was an intelligent and responsive audience, both of citizens and of students.\nAtlanta is taller and fiercer and richer. A terrible blood-sucking crowded hell with heavens for the white rich, roundabout, outside. Money, money and gaud. No culture, no humanity, American in the crassest sense. Here even as in Jacksonville and Augusta, they are piling the white “Crackers” on black folk, and adding insult. At the depot, no colored persons can hire a yellow cab, and no black man can keep his cab at or even near the depot. All the Negro quarter is neglected. “The main bridge from the center of Negro population out past Atlanta University to the High School is broken down and roped off. The High School and all the colored schools have two and three sessions a day. Down in the low bottoms is the unpaved mud and unsewered homes of the black poor, looking much as they did twenty years ago, when I first saw them. Ugliness is rampant in Atlanta save in the white residential developments that circle roundabout and add suave and gracious beauty to the carcass of the city. A city of dope and coca-cola. Atlanta University is falling behind in buildings and equipment. It has its old spirit, its library and laboratories and a good body of students, but they are not as enthusiastic and do not give the evidence of intelligence that I saw in many other schools. New blood and new ideas are needed in the faculty; and yet probably no institution in the South has so significant a body of loyal alumni. Over across the hill are Morehouse and Spelman. 1 did not see Morehouse in the light, but the alert body of Morehouse and Spelman students was up to the highest mark. I could feel the audience thrill beneath me. I am not sure about the Morehouse teachers. I saw only a few. But Spelman has risen from the dead. It has a library with books, a new and beautiful quadrangle and a _ chapel which is a shrine, although one is sorry that it wasn’t built to be something more useful than a shrine. The President is an energetic woman, whom it is a pleasure to meet."

    "text": "Tuskegee\nAnd now to Tuskegee. It is twenty-five years or more since I saw Tuskegee. Booker Washington was then at his zenith and the Tuskegee idea was triumphant. It was a combination of something insistent but suspicious that led to my invitation twenty-five years ago to talk to the Tuskegee summer school. I come back to find the school a city. One can no longer speak of a single institution, or judge this mass of buildings, roads and institutions as one thing. It is a great historic growth, and most significant of all, it has grown beautiful. It lies in curving undulating hills, with pines and trees and grass, and the happy voices of thousands of young folk.\nI was interested to know about these young people, but I had only time to glimpse them. In other days, Tuskegee was a silent marching regiment. It had no soul. There is still regimentation. The silence of the chapel was uncanny. The marching is overdone, and yet, the grade of the students, their intelligence, their initiative, has greatly increased. I talked to a college of over 100 students (fancy a college at Tuskegee! and no openings of graves, no waving of cerements.) They were bright-eyed men and women. They were doing something. But, of course, Tuskegee is caught in the problem of its own making. It has its artisans and its grammar school students, its High School students, and its college, it has its teachers, who are a jumble of all kinds of culture and training. Only the unity of a great ideal can carry such an_institution on to success. And there can be no doubt, it is moving on.\nThe National Hospital at Tuskegee is a miracle. Here black Americans have done the impossible with great buildings and beautiful grounds, and the Circle of the officers dwellings. The spirit of efficiency and discipline, is exactly the thing which even black people, a few years ago, suid we were not prepared for. Of the fifty-one Veterans’ Hospitals, this one stands well within the first half dozen. It has an excellent library with books that are read. It has secured experts, and it succeeded in the face of an Alabama mob, which threatened to lynch Robert R. Moton, unless he put white men in the control of the hospital, and sent “nigger nurse maids” to wait on white nurses, lest they touch black skins. One can hardly reconstruct that extraordinary outburst, even in memory.\nThere has been reconstruction at Fisk University. It is the one institution that I visited which feels thoroughly modern, and that feeling comes in some very little things. When I think that for thirteen years I had to get up at Atlanta University and eat breakfast at 6:45, I unconsciously make one test of modern culture, the hour of breakfast in these schools. It varies from 6 A. M. on. But at Fisk alone, is there a moveable breakfast hour from seven to seven thirty, with students who may go and come, within these limits. Men students smoke on the Fisk campus. I am not sure about the women. I hope they do, too. The men and women mingle quite naturally. I saw them walking and talking together at times and places, which would have sent us to the penitentiary in my day, and made them liable to hanging, drawing and quartering under the MacKenzie regime.\nAll this does not solve the problem of discipline by any means. It simply opens the door to its solution. There must be scores of young people who can not stand this freedom, having never been required to before. But it gives one a sigh of human relief to see baby nurses and swaddling clothes dropping at last from grownup Negro students.\nFisk has a good library. It has excellent laboratories in Chemistry and Biology. It needs buildings. In Fisk, everything except historic Jubilee and the chapel could well be swept out of\nIn teaching force, Fisk has the difficulty of the newer Negro colleges, It is more and more easy to get black men who know higher mathematics, but these men may not know enough not to proceed the hostess out of the dining room. Difficulties of culture and knowledge are bound to recur at an institution like Fisk. But the same thing is true when we compare Western and Eastern universities, or American and English. Knowledge comes but culture lingers. Fisk and °Talladega were the only institutions on my list that dare choose “The Russian Revolution” as one of the subjects, and on the night after the lecture, there was assembled in the historic parlors of Jubilee, a gathering that astounded me. Teachers and students mingling quite freely. A few white teachers and one or two students from Vanderbilt and other white institutions, and fifteen or sixteen representatives of foreign peoples: Chinese, Italians, South Americans, Russians, Dutch, Swiss, and others. It was an unusual and inspiring scene.\nThere is always one looming and insistent difficulty at Fisk: the teachers and students of white Vanderbilt and Peabody come in contact with at least the white Fisk teachers and executives. Unconsciously they will seek to dominate and advise, and the authorities at Fisk may easily be tempted to defer to this public opinion, rather than to the more reticent and poorly expressed public opinion of the black world. But right here, let Fisk beware. It went on the rocks in a former administration because the Chamber of Commerce of Nashville tried to set standards for it. The standards of Fisk University are being set today by its own Alumni and the colored world. It must continue in this line despite Vanderbilt, Peabody and all white Nashville.\nTalladega is a small, quiet New England college, built in the heart of Alabama. It has splendid work in biology, a thorough going library, good dormitories, and probably the best dining hall in the colored South. It has a President who is quiet and courteous and gives his teachers and officers real authority, and it has, what seems to me, a rather unusual collection of white and colored teachers and officers. Talladega is today one of the best and best growing institutions of the South.\nI made my last speech to the colored citizens of Bowling Green in a Baptist Church on a grey and drizzly Thanksgiving evening. I had missed my Thanksgiving dinner, but my audience had not, and one girl got colic while I was speaking. But it was a kindly audience and it listened. And so, out of great waters, and with billows of new knowledge rolling in my ears, I came across the Ohio to the ramparts of Cincinnati and over the Alleghanies and home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNegro Education (1918)\nLight (1912)\nThe Negro College (1933)\nSchools (1917)\nEducation (1911)"

    "text": "Dr. R.L.A. Pechstein of the University of Cincinnati last February made a Report at the National Society of College Teachers meeting in Cleveland. His thesis was that the “Segregation of Negro and white children in separate schools accomplished far more for the black race than can be gained in mixed classes.”\nHe stated that among Negroes there were two opinions: That the Radicals ask for mixed schools, and the Conservatives want separate schools. His basis of fact was that Negro high schools had more Negro graduates than mixed high schools; that a study of 100 Negroes of eminence showed that 83 per cent attended separate elementary schools, and that about half attended mixed colleges; a study of 3,000 Negro pupils showed much mental deficiency and retardation, calling for special classes.\nIt is reported that he relied for his facts on the thesis of a colored school principal, Dr. Jennie Porter.\nPropaganda further advocating this proposal has followed Pechstein’s paper. It is time that the matter be fairly faced and threshed out."

    "text": "School Democracy\nIn the first place, it goes without saying that Pechstein ignores the background of his facts. He says nothing of the long battle for educational democracy which Negroes conservative and radical have fought in Boston, New York, Philadelphia and _ elsewhere. He knows perfectly well as an educator that the public school is not the best possible instrument for every single child. Very bright children, very dull children, timid children and over-grown, the children of the rich and cultured people, Catholic children, Jewish children,—can all make great and undoubted advance in certain lines if educated by themselves and segregated from the rest of the community.\nYet, the United States, Germany, France, and most civilized countries have urged the public school and democracy in education for all. And they have done this because of the fact that whatever may be lost in this group education, the human contact which comes through democratic education of all the youth of a great country, infinitely over balances it. They realize that if peace, good-will and industrial democracy are going to triumph in the world, they can only triumph by increase in the intelligence of individuals and the increase of direct knowledge and sympathetic human relationship among men. Any step backward from this: any building up of artificial barriers, Or over-emphasizing of natural barriers, is a blow in the face of civilization and human advance.\nIn the United States, we rightly fear the growth of a separate Catholic school system; we are apprehensive at the increased tendency of the rich and cultured to take their children out of the public schools and to make certain colleges segregated institutions for these children. We dislike the exclusive fraternities in colleges, and we ban them almost entirely in high schools.\nOur feeling in all this matter is that the forces of disruption, of hatred, of enmity and of misunderstanding between groups and individuals are so tremendous today and have been so fatal in the past that there is almost no sacrifice that we ought not to be willing to make in order to put down increased separation among men and in order to multiply understanding, sympathy and human acquaintanceship.\nThis is the great foundation for the public school.\nThis program involves many difficulties. When the poor Irish came to Massachusetts in the middle of the 19th Century, there was bitter opposition to their presence in the public schools. They were ignorant, dirty, ragged and retarded. Italians and people from the Balkans of Southeast Europe later brought the same problems. Naturally, the Negroes, both in the past and present, have been a severe problem for the mixed public schools. By slavery, caste, law and custom, they have been ignorant and poverty-stricken and have lagged behind the average school age."

    "text": "The Negro in School\nAnd what of it? In a thousand different communities Negro pupils have proven their ability to profit by the public schools; they have made high records and graduated with honor. Their poverty is part of a universal problem; their retardation is due to wretched Southern school systems; their dullness comes from poor food and poor homes and there is absolutely no scientific proof that it is Negroid. Every one of these problems has a well known and adequately tested solution.\nThe recent migration of Negroes to the North has naturally intensified and re-opened these problems but it would be a despicable yielding to reaction and cowardice to give up democracy in the public schools because of the very disadvantages which lack of democracy and opportunity have fastened upon the Negro population of the South.\nIn the face of these problems many like Pechstein, narrow in reasoning and ignorant of all the facts are always rushing to find the easiest way out of the difficulty. With them work the Pecksniffs—the hypocrites who use any excuse to degrade and beat back the Negro. It is peculiarly Pecksniffian to raise the fact that most prominent Negroes have been educated in separate schools, as an argument for separate schools. Most Negroes had to be educated in separate schools or not be educated at all since for a hundred years more than 9/10 of them were offered “Jim-crow” schools or nothing. It is obvious that the well-known and magnificent Negro high schools of Baltimore and Washington send out a much larger proportion of well-trained Negro graduates than the Negro-baiting mixed high schools of a hundred different Northern cities. But Merciful God! is this an argument for segregation, or against discrimination, cruelty, cheating and hate on the part of white pupils, teachers and officials? If the success of the Dunbar High School is to be built on the lawless snobbery of Gary, what is American democracy headed for? The success of some separate Negro schools is a crushing indictment of hatred and prejudice and not a demand for further segregation.\nIf Negroes have done well in certain separate Negro schools, two speculations arise: how much more might Negroes have done if all their separate schools had been adequately equipped and taught; and further what might not the Negro pupil have done if without hurt or hindrance the whole educational opportunity of America had been open to him, without discrimination."

    "text": "The “Jim-Crow” School\nThe well-equipped “Jim Crow” school is a rare exception. For the most part, such schools have been run on wretchedly inadequate resources; taught by ignorant teachers; housed in huts and dumps; and given just as little attention and supervision as the authorities dared give them. The discrimination against the separate Negro public schools in the United States is one of the most despicable and disgusting of the discriminations against this enslaved race and if Pechstein does not know this he is far more ignorant than we suspect.\nIf he does know it and still advocates separate schools, he may believe that funds can be had to make Negro schools decent and that segregation really settles the problem of Negro pupils. But how can a man of even elementary mentality argue this? Segregation if logical would double the cost of schools in the South and it distinctly increases it in Cincinnati. Any proposal for separate Negro schools is in effect a demand for schools less well housed, less well supported, less well-equipped and less wellsupervised than the average public school. How can segregation by color settle the problem of the retardation of stupid pupils? Not even the wildest Nordic claims that all Negroes are morons. If South Carolina spends $1.00 a year to educate.a colored child, when that child appears in the Cincinnati schools, he is bound to be backward. Mr. Pechstein proposes properly to give such children the special training which they need; but he does not stop here. He also proposes that into this special school shall go all colored children whether they are stupid or not! Now what is there that a purely Negro school can give backward Negro children which any school for the retarded cannot give them? And what can normal Negro children get in a Negro school that they cannot get in a mixed school? Everybody knows: everybody knows that a Catholic school differs from other schools by teaching catholicism in addition to the school curriculum; that a Young Ladies Finishing School teaches _refined snobbery and that a Negro school teaches race solidarity and race pride and (whether consciously or unconsciously) distrust of all white folks. Cf course the Negro school and the Catholic school and the schools for the rich will have teachers more sympathetic to their propaganda but this is the damnation of democracy and the shame of the teaching profession and not the goal and ideal of the public schools. Have we come to the day when only cripples can teach cripples and when the only hope of the Chinese is to protect them from white teachers?"

    "text": "Hypocrisy\nNaturally little or nothing of this is in the Pechstein mind. Here, deliberately or gropingly, this mind goes Pecksnifian: Negroes can be best kept from too great and fast advance by segregating them into cheaper facilities and opportunities. They can be induced thus to commit hari-kari by subtle appeals to pride and poverty. After all black folk are no less stupid and avaricious than whites. Give them one extra fine public school such as the people of Cincinnati gave them, and the majority of Negroes will jump to receive it. It gives them their one opportunity to teach at home at good salaries; it gives them some chance to direct their own children’s education. The children themselves discover a school that welcomes and encourages them instead of sneering at them and kicking them out. But is this all? O, no! The Negro who comes through the Negro college and studies Negro history under black professors; the child who comes through the Negro school with Negro teachers, is going to grow up as a Negro and not as an American. He is going to hate and despise the civilization that enslaved him, and now insults him. He is going to believe that the world of white folk is armed against the world of black folk, and that one of these days they are going to fight it out to the bitter end. He is going to demand more and more the power to equip himself for this fight. Segregation breeds segregation. If Negroes must have separate schools, they should have separate school officials, a separate school budget, and a separate system of text books. They should push on to more separation and more self-government in every line of life. They will more and more resent the intervention of white folk in their life and suspect their every motive."

At Chattanooga she was asked if her movement meant the giving of votes to colored women. Mrs. Belmont was most adroit. The expectant hush fell on the audience and instead of standing up like a frank woman and saying “Yes,” Mrs. Belmont quibbled and twisted after the most approved southern fashion. “We want,” she said, “the same voting privileges for colored women as are given colored men.” And there the adroitness stands naked and unashamed.\nIt will undoubtedly attract the support of those southerners who want aristocratic white women to vote and to vote their narrow-headed prejudices into a new southern oligarchy. But there are people whom such dishonesty will not attract. It will not, for instance, attract the tens of thousands of black voters who are going to cast their ballots in certain states this fall where the suffrage question will come up. They will not be satisfied in having their black sisters of the South disfranchised like their black brothers and they will hold in frank and logical suspicion a party that is working for that kind of democracy.\nMoreover, there are thousands of white people in this country whom this kind of quibbling disgusts. Everybody knows what desperate effort has been made by certain elements among the suffragists to dodge the Negro problem, to try and work for democracy for white people while being dumb before slavery for blacks.

Murder, for instance, sounds very awful and yet we must remember that one of those lynched for murder was killed in defence of a colored woman’s honor. In another case a marshal had already shot a man whom he was about to arrest. The man then killed him and was promptly lynched. In two Florida cases proof that the lynched men were innocent came after they were dead. Blood hounds and posses have been responsible for desperate resistance on the part of men afterward lynched, and in one case the man who had been respited on account of doubt of his gruilt was promptly killed by the mob.\nThe so-called assaults were to a considerable extent fights where the white man was worsted. One constable received a flesh wound and his assailant was lynched, whereupon the constable promptly recovered. Another white man suffered the indignity of being struck by a hoe, and still another of having his chin bitten off. The assailants in both cases were killed with great enthusiasm.\nAttacks on property are most irritating, and one boy who stole a pair of shoes suffered the same fate as a man who stole a couple of mules. Mules are quite valuable in Mississippi. In the very recent lynchings in Louisiana it would seem that the search for a missing $500 was the chief motive. The burning of a barn in Mississippi resulted in two lynchings.\nThe chivalry of southern white manhood toward colored women has been particularly conspicuous this season. Two men raped a colored girl in Oklahoma. One was killed by her brother and their friends thereupon lynched the girl! A Mississippi mob killed a wife along with her husband, leaving a four-year-old child motherless, while in another case a colored woman who had the impudence to refuse to allow her home to be searched was summarily dealt with.\nOn the other hand, white womanhood received its usual protection. An impudent porter pushed a white woman off the sidewalk and was lynched. In two cases colored men were found in white women’s rooms. They were immediately charged with “attempted” rape and killed.\nHuman bonfires have been made in three or four cases: one in Georgia, one in Mississippi, and one in Louisiana. In Louisiana the victim was a nice old man of the “uncle” type which the white South particularly loves. A theatrical company playing “Potash and Perlmutter” made an excursion to the entertainment and several society women were present.\nAll this goes to show how peculiarly fitted the United States is for moral leadership of the world; for putting to shame the dreadful people who are fighting in Europe and seem quite lost to decency. It is a fine thing to have under these circumstances the stern cool leadership of President Wilson, who has recently raised his finger and with a sad look on his benevolent face told the South “as a Southerner” that they must “know the needs of the Negro and sympathetically help him in every way that is possible for his good and for our good.” The President ended with a charming story from Charles Lamb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLynchings (1932)\nCauses of Lynching (1931)\nLynching (1914)\nAnti-Lynching Legislation (1922)\nLynching (1928)"

With those of us who were most determined to keep our faith in the President the doubt has been growing steadily. At first, with his clear utterances to colored delegations and his letters during the campaign, it seemed impossible that so high-minded and scholarly a man could repudiate these plain, straightforward words. If they had been voiced by the ordinary type of politician we should justly have regarded them with suspicion; but here was a man who, despite his southern birth, his academic exclusiveness, and his presidency of a Negro-hating institution, nevertheless seemed so fine a type of cultured and honest American that there appeared absolutely no reason for doubting that he would fulfill his word to the letter and treat the Negro with absolute fairness.\nWhen, at the very outset of his administration he failed to do this, we put the blame on his southern subordinates and pressed him for some clear, outward sign or word which would prove his honesty of purpose. We were fed on quiet assurances of good will, unaccompanied by any supporting action. Finally, we had the extraordinary declaration of national “Jim-Crow” policy made to Mr. Trotter, but made as we hoped under such stress of feeling as to be not altogether taken at face value.\nWhen, however, Mr. Wilson, after careful thought and preparation summons before him The University Commission on -Southern Race Questions and gives utterances to the utterly banal assertion that we must “know the needs” of the Negro and “sympathetically help him” with the amazing qualification of restricting help to “sensible” lines—all this shows neither the statesman nor the sincere man, but the man who either not daring or not caring to utter clear, strong words for or against ten million people, contents himself with shifty and unmeaning platitudes.

In the latter work Negro charity has become institutional and the old folks’ home is perhaps the most characteristic Negro charity.\nThere are today in the United States not less than one hundred homes supported and conducted very largely by colored people. One of them, the Home for Aged and Infirm Colored Persons at Philadelphia, was endowed by a colored man in 1864 with a capital of about $100,000. Philanthropic whites have added to this until the Home’s property now is worth $400,000. In other cases, as in Springfield, Mass., a colored man, Primus Mason, founded a home for all races; and in New Bedford, a colored woman, Miss Elizabeth C. Carter, has a home for which she has collected over $35,000.\nThis article refers primarily to the Home for Aged Colored People in Cleveland, Ohio. It was founded by Mrs. Eliza Bryant in 1893 and incorporated in 1896. The present property containing eleven rooms and all improvements was purchased in 1901, burned down soon after, but reoccupied in 1902. The home is valued at $11,725, with a mortgage indebtedness of $4,000. The home collects through donations, entertainments and the like about $2,200 a year. There is a house furnishing committee which collected $373 worth of furniture last year; there is a $15,000 campaign committee which is hard at work. The institution is conducted by a board of trustees consisting of twenty persons of whom four are men and the rest women. The home is a member of the Cleveland Federation for Charity and Philanthropy and thus receives advice and co-operation in the latest philanthropic methods. This institution together with dozens of similar institutions throughout the United States call for the sympathy and co-operation of all right-minded people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWhite Charity (1922)\nTenements (1916)\nMuddle (1914)\nPhilanthropy and Self Help (1918)\nDeath Rates (1927)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “An Old Folks’ Home.”\nThe Crisis 9 (5): 242–43. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/09/05/old-folks-home.html."

There are in this country at least six times as many murders each year as in England, France and Germany; while Berlin has two murders for every hundred thousand of population, New York has six, Chicago has nine, Atlanta has twenty-three and Memphis has fifty-eight. The influence of the race problem can be directly traced by comparing southern and northern cities. Memphis, Charleston, Savannah, New Orleans, Atlanta, Nashville, Louisville, St. Louis and Cincinnati are hot-beds of homicide. It is not merely the murder of black men by white men in these cities, but also the murder of white men by black men, of white men by white men and of black men by black men.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many colored persons, and persons interested in them, may easily make the mistake of supposing that the present war is far removed from the color problem of America and that in the face of this great catastrophe we may forget for a moment such local problems and give all attention and contributions to the seemingly more pressing cause.\nThis attitude is a mistake. The present war in Europe is one of the great disasters due to race and color prejudice and it but foreshadows greater disasters in the future.\nIt is not merely national jealousy, or the so-called “race” rivalry of Slav, Teuton and Latin, that is the larger cause of this war. It is rather the wild quest for Imperial expansion among colored races between Germany, England and France primarily, and Belgium. Italy, Russia and Austria-Hungary in lesser degree. Germany long since found herself shut out from acquiring colonies. She looked toward South America, but the “Monroe Doctrine” stood in her way. She started for Africa and by bulldozing methods secured one good colony, one desert and two swamps. Her last efforts looked toward North Africa and Asia-Minor. Finally, she evidently decided at the first opportunity to seize English or French colonies and to this end feverishly expanded her navy, kept her army at the highest point of efficiency and has been for twenty years the bully of Europe with a chip on her shoulder and defiance in her mouth.\nThe colonies which England and France own and Germany covets are largely in tropical and semi-tropical lands and inhabited by black, brown and yellow peoples. In such colonies there is a chance to confiscate land, work the natives at low wages, make large profits and open wide markets for cheap European manufactures. Asia, Africa, the South Sea Islands, the West Indies, Mexico and Central America and much of South America have long been designated by the white world as fit field for this kind of commercial exploitation, for the benefit of Europe and with little regard for the welfare of the natives. One has only to remember the forced labor in South Africa, the outrages in Congo, the cocoa-slavery in Portuguese Africa, the land monopoly and peonage of Mexico, the exploitation of Chinese coolies and the rubber horror of the Amazon to realize what white imperialism is doing to-day in well-known cases, not to mention thousands of less-known instances.\nIn this way a theory of the inferiority of the darker peoples and a contempt for their rights and aspirations has become all but universal in the greatest centers of modern culture. Here it was that American color prejudice and race hatred received in recent years unexpected aid and sympathy. To-day civilized nations arc fighting like mad dogs over the right to own and exploit these darker peoples.\nIn such case where should our sympathy lie? Undoubtedly, with the Allies—with England and France in particular. Not that these nations are innocent. England was in the past blood- guilty above all lands in her wicked and conscienceless rape of darker races. England was primarily responsible for American slavery, for the starvation of India, and the Chinese opium traffic. But the salvation of England is that she has the ability to learn from her mistakes. To-day no white nation is fairer in its treatment of darker peoples than England. Not that England is yet fair. She is not yet just, and she still nourishes much disdain for colored races, erects contemptible and humiliating political and social barriers and steals their land and labor; but as compared with Germany England is an angel of light. The record of Germany as a colonizer toward weaker and darker people is the most barbarous of any civilized people and grows worse instead of better. France is less efficient than England as an administrator of colonies and has consequently been guilty of much neglect and injustice; but she is nevertheless the most kindly of all European nations in her personal relations with colored folk. She draws no dead line of color and colored Frenchmen always love France.\nBelgium has been as pitiless and grasping as Germany and in strict justice deserves every pang she is suffering after her unspeakable atrocities in Congo. Russia has never drawn a color line but has rather courted the yellow races, although with ulterior motives. Japan, however, instilled wholesome respect in this line.\nUndoubtedly, then the triumph of the allies would at least leave the plight of the colored races no worse than now. Indeed, considering the. fact than black Africans and brown Indians and yellow Japanese are fighting for France and England it may be that they will come out of this frightful welter of blood with new ideas of the essential equality of all men.\nOn the other hand, the triumph of Germany means the triumph of every force calculated to subordinate darker peoples. It would mean triumphant militarism, autocratic and centralized government and a studied theory of contempt for everything except Germany—“Germany above everything in the world.” The dispair and humiliation of Germany in the eighteenth century has brought this extraordinary rebound of self-exaltation and disdain for mankind. The triumph of this idea would mean a crucifixion of darker peoples unparalleled in history.\nThe writer speaks without anti-German bias; personally he has deep cause to love the German people. They made him believe in the essential humanity of white folk twenty years ago when he was near to denying it. But even then the spell of militarism was in the air, and the Prussian strut had caught the nation’s imagination. They were starting on the same road with the southern American whites toward a contempt toward human beings and a faith in their own utter superiority to all other breeds. This feeling had not then applied itself particularly to colored folk and has only begun to to-day; but it is going by leaps and bounds.. Germany needs but the role of world conquest to make her one of the most contemptible of “Nigger hating nations. Just as we go to press, the Berliner Tageblatt publishes a proclamation by”German representatives of Science and Art to the World of Culture” in which men like Harnack, Bode, Hauptmann, Suderman, Roentgen, Humperdink, Wundt and others, insult hundreds of millions of human beings by openly sneering at “Mongrels and Niggers.””\nAs colored Americans then, and as Americans who fear race prejudice as the greatest of War-makers, our sympathies in the awful conflict should be with France and England; not that they have conquered race prejudice, but they have at least begun to realize its cost and evil, while Germany exalts it.\nIf so great, a catastrophe has followed jealousies and greed built on a desire to steal from and oppress people whom the dominant culture despises, how much wilder and wider will be the conflict when black and brown and yellow people stand up together shoulder to shoulder and demand recognition as men!\nLet us give then our sympathies to those nations whose triumph will most tend to postpone if not to make unnecessary a world war of races.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nGermany (1916)\nClose Ranks (1918)\nThe Present (1917)\nA Winter Pilgrimage (1911)\nTravel (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “World War and the Color Line.”\nThe Crisis 9 (1): 28–30. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/09/01/worldwar.html."

    "title": "The Immediate Program of the American Negro",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The immediate program of the American Negro means nothing unless it is mediate to his great ideal and the ultimate ends of his development. We need not waste time by seeking to deceive our enemies into thinking that we are going to be content with a half loaf, or by being willing to lull our friends into a false sense of our indifference and present satisfaction.\n\nThe American Negro demands equality—political equality, industrial equality and social equality; and he is never going to rest satisfied with anything less. He demands this in no spirit of braggadocio and with no obsequious envy of others, but as an absolute measure of self-defense and the only one that will assure to the darker races their ultimate survival on earth.\nOnly in a demand and a persistent demand for essential equality in the modern realm of human culture can any people show a real pride of race and a decent self-respect. For any group, nation or race to admit for a moment the present monstrous demand of the white race to be the inheritors of the earth, the arbiters of mankind and the sole owners of a heritage of culture which they did not create, nor even improve to any greater extent than the other great division of men—to admit such pretense for a moment is for the race to write itself down immediately as indisputably inferior in judgment, knowledge and common sense.\nThe equality in political, industrial and social life which modern men must have in order to live, is not to be confounded with sameness. On the contrary, in our case, it is rather insistence upon the right of diversity;—upon the right of a human being to be a man even if he does not wear the same cut of vest, the same curl of hair or the same color of skin. Human equality does not even entail, as is sometimes said, absolute equality of opportunity; for certainly the natural inequalities of inherent genius and varying gift make this a dubious phase. But there is a more and more clearly recognized minimum of opportunity and maximum of freedom to be, to move and to think, which the modern world denies to no being which it recognizes as a real man.\nThese involve both negative and positive sides. They call for freedom on the one hand and power on the other. The Negro must have political freedom; taxation without representation is tyranny. American Negroes of to-day are ruled by tyrants who take what they please in taxes and give what they please in law and administration, in justice and in injustice; and the great mass of black people must stand helpless and voiceless before a condition which has time and time again caused other peoples to fight and die.\nThe Negro must have industrial freedom. Between the peonage of the rural South, the oppression of shrewd capitalists and the jealousy of certain trade unions, the Negro laborer is the most exploited class in the country, giving more hard toil for less money than any other American, and have less voice in the conditions of his labor.\nIn social intercourse every effort is being made to-day from the President of the United States and the so-called Church of Christ down to saloons and boot-blacks to segregate, strangle and spiritually starve Negroes so as to give them the least possible chance to know and share civilization.\nThese shackles must go. But that is but the beginning. The Negro must have power; the power of men, the right to do, to know, to feel and to express that knowledge, action and spiritual gift. He must not simply be free from the political tyranny of white folk, he must have the right to vote and to rule over the citizens, white and black, to the extent of his proven foresight and ability. He must have a voice in the new industrial democracy which is building and the power to see to it that his children are not in the next generation trained to be the mudsills of society. He must have the right to social intercourse with his fellows. There was a time in the atomic individualistic group when “social intercourse’ meant merely calls and tea-parties; to-day social intercourse means theatres, lectures, organizations, churches, clubs, excursions, travel, hotels,—it means in short Life; to bar a group from such methods of thinking, living and doing is to bar them from the world and bid them create a new world;—a task to which no single group is today equal; it is to crucify them and taunt them with not being able to live.\nWhat now are the practical steps which must be taken to accomplish these ends?\nFirst of all before taking steps the wise man knows the object and end of his journey. There are those who would advise the black man to pay little or no attention to where he is going so long as he keeps moving. They assume that God or his vice-gerent the White Man will attend to the steering. This is arrant nonsense. The feet of those that aimlessly wander land as often in hell as in heaven. Conscious self-realization and self-direction is the watchword of modern man, and the first article in the program of any group that will survive must be the great aim, equality and power among men.\nThe practical steps to this are clear. First we must fight obstructions; by continual and increasing effort we must first make American courts either build up a body of decisions which will protect the plain legal rights of American citizens or else make them tear down the civil and political rights of all citizens in order to oppress a few. Either result will bring justice in the end. It is lots of fun and most ingenious just now for courts to twist law so as to say I shall not live here or vote there, or marry the woman who wishes to marry me. But when to-morrow these decisions throttle all freedom and overthrow the foundation of democracy and decency, there is going to be some judicial house cleaning.\nWe must secondly seek in legislature and congress remedial legislation; national aid to public school education, the removal of all legal discriminations based simply on race and color, and those marriage laws passed to make the seduction of black girls easy and without legal penalty.\nThird the human contact of human beings must be increased; the policy which brings into sympathetic touch and understanding, men and women, rich and poor, capitalist and laborer, Asiatic and European, must bring into closer contact and mutual knowledge the white and black people of this land. It is the most frightful indictment of a country which dares to call itself civilized that it has allowed itself to drift into a state of ignorance where ten million people are coming to believe that all white people are liars and thieves, and the whites in turn to believe that the chief industry of Negroes is raping white women.\nFourth only the publication of the truth repeatedly and incisively and uncompromisingly can secure that change in public opinion which will correct these awful lies. The Crisis, our record of the darker races, must have a circulation not of 35,000 chiefly among colored folk but of at least 250,000 among all men who believe in men. It must not be a namby-pamby box of salve, but a voice that thunders fact and is more anxious to be true than pleasing. There should be a campaign of tract distribution—short well written facts and arguments—rained over this land by millions of copies, particularly in the South, where the white people know less about the Negro than in any other part of the civilized world. The press should be utilized—the 400 Negro weeklies, the great dailies and eventually the magazines, when we get magazine editors who will lead public opinion instead of following afar with resonant brays. Lectures, lantern-slides and moving pictures, co-operating with a bureau of information and eventually becoming a Negro encyclopedia, all these are efforts along the line of making human beings realize that Negroes are human.\nSuch is the program of work against obstructions. Let us now turn to constructive effort. This may be summed up under (1) economic co-operation (2) a revival of art and literature (3) political action (4) education and (5) organization.\nUnder economic co-operation we must strive to spread the idea among colored people that the accumulation of wealth is for social rather than individual ends. We must avoid, in the advancement of the Negro race, the mistakes of ruthless exploitation which have marked modern economic history. To this end we must seek not simply home ownership, small landholding and saving accounts, but also all forms of co-operation, both in production and distribution, profit sharing, building and loan associations, systematic charity for definite, practical ends, systematic migration from mob rule and robbery, to freedom and enfranchisement, the emancipation of women and the abolition of child labor.\nIn art and literature we should try to loose the tremendous emotional wealth of the Negro and the dramatic strength of his problems through writing, the stage, pageantry and other forms of art. We should resurrect forgotten ancient Negro art and history, and we should set the black man before the world as both a creative artist and a strong subject for artistic treatment.\nIn political action we should organize the votes of Negroes in such congressional districts as have any number of Negro voters. We should systematically interrogate candidates on matters vital to Negro freedom and uplift. We should train colored voters to reject the bribe of office and to accept only decent legal enactments both for their own uplift and for the uplift of laboring classes of all races and both sexes.\nIn education we must seek to give colored children free public school training. We must watch with grave suspicion the attempt of those who, under the guise of vocational training, would fasten ignorance and menial service on the Negro for another generation. Our children must not in large numbers, be forced into the servant class; for menial service is still, in the main, little more than an antiquated survival of impossible conditions. It has always been as statistics show, a main cause of bastardy and prostitution and despite its many marvelous exceptions it will never come to the light of decency and honor until the house servant becomes the Servant in the House. It is our duty then, not drastically but persistently, to seek out colored children of ability and genius, to open up to them broader, industrial opportunity and above all, to find that Talented Tenth and encourage it by the best and most exhaustive training in order to supply the Negro race and the world with leaders, thinkers and artists.\nFor the accomplishment of all these ends we must organize. Organization among us already has gone far but it must go much further and higher. Organization is sacrifice. It is sacrifice of opinions, of time, of work and of money, but it is, after all, the cheapest way of buying the most priceless of gifts—freedom and efficiency. I thank God that most of the money that supports the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People comes from black hands; a still larger proportion must so come, and we must not only support but control this and similar organizations and hold them unwaveringly to our objects, our aims and our ideals.\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “The Immediate Program of the American Negro.” The Crisis. 9(6):310–312.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nThe Strength of Segregation (1913)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nOptimism (1929)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1915. “The Immediate Program of the American\nNegro.” The Crisis 9 (6): 310–12. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/09/06/immediate_program.html."

Yet, he is here defending eleven people who have few friends and I have heard of no single word from any Christian minister of Detroit protesting against the mobbing of Dr. Sweet’s home and those of many other self-respecting, lawabiding Negroes here in Detroit. Leaving orthodoxy aside, which action, Mr. Darrow’s or the Christian ministers’, most nearly coincides with the tenets of Christianity?\n\nChristianity which stops dead at the color line or the dollar mark is a pretty poor religion. The Presbyterian ministry of Detroit might more appropriately have assailed Mr. Darrow’s ideas on religion and prohibition if they had, here in Detroit, done some definite thing towards the practice of their vaunted Christianity in the case of Dr. and Mrs. Sweet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Sweet Trial (1926)\nA Soldier (1920)\nCourts and Jails (1932)\nCrime (1920)\nThe Challenge of Detroit (1925)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “The First Battle of Detroit.”\nThe Crisis 31 (3): 114. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/31/03/first_battle_of_detroit.html."

    "text": "The New Negro, edited by Alain Locke. Albert and Charles Boni, New York, 1925. 446 pages.\n\nThis extraordinary book in many ways marks an epoch. It is in many respects sprawling, illogical, with an open and unashamed lack of unity and continuity, and yet it probably expresses better than any book that has been published in the last ten years the present state of thought and culture among American Negroes and it expresses it so well and so adequately, with such ramification into all phases of thought and attitude, that it is a singularly satisfying and inspiring thing.\nIt has, too, more than most books, a history. The well-known magazine, The Survey, which represents organized social reform in America, has always been traditionally afraid of the Negro problem and has usually touched it either not at all or gingerly. Even last year one of the editors at a great meeting of social workers in Los Angeles succeeded in talking over an hour on the social problems of America, dividing and examining them exhaustively both geographically and qualitatively, and yet said no word on the race problems.\nNotwithstanding this The Survey has grown and developed tremendously in the last few years. I remember vividly being asked by The Survey to furnish it for the New Year 1914 a statement of the aims of the N.A.A.C.P. I did so and said among other things:\n\nSixth—Finally, in 1914, the Negro must demand his social rights. His right to be treated as a gentleman when he acts like one, to marry any sane, grown person who wants to marry him, and to meet and eat with his friends without being accused of undue assumption or unworthy ambition.\n\nNo sooner had the editors of The Survey read this than they telephoned frantically to some of the directors of the N.A.A.C.P. and they found easily several who did not agree with this statement and one indeed who threatened to resign if it were published. The Survey therefore refused to publish my statement unless this particular paragraph were excised. The statement was not published. Since then much water has flowed under the bridge and it happened last year that the editor of The Survey was sitting next to Mr. A. G. Dill, our business manager, at a dinner given to Miss Fauset in honor of the appearance of her novel, “There Is Confusion.” The editor looked at the company with interest and Mr. Dill began to tell him who they were. It occurred to the editor of The Survey that here was material for a Survey Graphic; still he hesitated and feared the “social uplifters” of the United States with a mighty fear. But he took one step which saved the day: He got a colored man to edit that number of the Graphic, Alain Locke, a former Rhodes scholar and a professor at Howard University. Locke did a good job, so good a job that this Negro number of the Survey Graphic was one of the most successful numbers ever issued by The Survey. It was a happy thought on the part of the Bonis to have the material thus collected, arranged and expanded, combined with the painting and decoration of Winold Reiss and issued as a book which states and explains the present civilization of black folk in America. Mr. Locke has done a fine piece of editing. The proof reading, the bibliographies and the general arrangement are all beyond criticism.\nWith one point alone do I differ with the Editor. Mr. Locke has newly been seized with the idea that Beauty rather than Propaganda should be the object of Negro literature and art. His book proves the falseness of this thesis. This is a book filled and bursting with propaganda but it is propaganda for the most part beautifully and painstakingly done; and it is a grave question if ever in this world in any renaissance there can be a search for disembodied beauty which is not really a passionate effort to do something tangible, accompanied and illumined and made holy by the vision of eternal beauty.\nOf course this involves a controversy as old as the world and much too transcendental for practical purposes, and yet, if Mr. Locke’s thesis is insisted on too much it is going to turn the Negro renaissance into decadence. It is the fight for Life and Liberty that is giving birth to Negro literature and art today and when, turning from this fight or ignoring it, the young Negro tries to do pretty things or things that catch the passing fancy of the really unimportant critics and publishers about him, he will find that he has killed the soul of Beauty in his Art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nToward a New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nRadicals (1919)\nThe Name Negro (1928)\nBrowsing Reader - The American Race Problem (1927)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “Our Book Shelf.” The Crisis\n31 (3): 140–41. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/31/03/book_shelf.html."

    "text": "Porgy. By DuBose Heyward. George H. Doran Company. New York. 1925. 196 pages.\nDuBose Heyward’s little novel of colored Charleston life, “Porgy,” is a beautiful piece of work. It is the Iliad of a small black beggar in the underworld of labor and crime surrounded by whiskey and lust and sanctified with music, a queer and quaint religion and a great yearning flood of love.\nSeldom before has a white Southern writer done black folk with so much of sympathy and subtle understanding. Heyward knows Porgy and his fellows; but his very knowledge brings forward the old and ever young criticism: Charleston has 35,000 persons of Negro descent. They include not only pitiful and terrible figures—beggars, drunkards and prostitutes—but self-supporting and self-respecting laborers and servants, artisans and merchants, professional men and housewives. There is a group of educated and well-to-do folk, beautiful in character and face, who look back on generations of freedom and comfort and accomplishment. Out of Charleston for a hundred years has flowed leadership of the colored folk of America and in Charleston still rest men and women who would be a credit to any modern nation.\nAnd yet if Charleston were swept by a cataclysm tomorrow, and the archaeologists of the 40th century searched white men’s writings to learn of its inhabitants in the 20th century, “Porgy” would remain as the best, almost the only picture. It would be a fine picture of the best type of Negro which DuBose Heyward could really know. Into the black underworld he can go almost unhindered save by that subtle veil he so delicately paints. But between him and the main mass of Charleston Negroes there is an unpassable gulf. Whose ever the fault is, the loss to art is irreparable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLight (1912)\nThe Unfortunate South (1920)\nFall Books (1924)\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nThe Simple Way (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “Our Book Shelf.” The Crisis\n31 (5): 240. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/31/05/book_shelf.html."

    "text": "In the fight for human rights across the color bar where is the firing line? In the United States, in the West Indies, or in Africa?\nMany sincere persons seem to think that this line is in Africa. This is not so. It may be so one hundred years from now but today Europe has so manipulated matters that the fight for rights in Africa is exceedingly difficult. The European countries with the army, the navy and the police in their hands; with their domination of the courts; with their ownership of capital and commerce and all lines of communication make any effort at uplift and reform a matter of disloyalty and rebellion which can bring summary punishment of the most violent sort. Free speech is impossible. There is no right to vote in the larger part of Africa. Consequently the fighting line-in Africa reduces itself to appeals to far-off powers who may perhaps never hear the appealing voices. Or it is a matter of revolt with every chance in favor of the oppressor. No, the firing line today is not in Africa.\nIs it in the West Indies? Again, no. In the West Indies we have an overwhelming majority of Negroes and a large number of Negro leaders of wealth and education, but the ownership of land and capital is predominantly in the hands of Europeans while the political power of the Negro is so small that the fight is unequal; and again, as in Africa, the West Indies are a long way from the centers of power in the world.\nThe real fighting line for the Negro, then, is in the United States. Here he faces his foe. Here he can use unmolested the modern weapons of writing, talking and voting. He can make the world listen because he is right in the world. With his millions of votes no presidential candidate, few congressmen and fewer senators dare altogether to ignore his demands. They may play upon his ignorance and prejudices but as he becomes intelligent, sincere and clear-headed his phalanx marches forward. America, then, is today the firing line of the Negro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHelping Africa (1924)\nFreedom of Speech (1930)\nResolutions of the Washington Conference (1917)\nKenya (1924)\nCrime (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1925. “The Firing Line.”\nThe Crisis 31 (2): 62. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/31/02/firing_line.html."

    "text": "The Book of American Negro Spirituals\n\nJames Weldon Johnson has edited, with an introduction, a book of Negro spirituals containing musical arrangements chiefly by his brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, and with other arrangements by Lawrence Brown. The result is peculiarly satisfying.\nIt is one thing for a race to produce artistic material; it is quite another thing for it to produce the ability to interpret and criticize this material. This is particularly true when the artistic gift is a matter of primitive development in the rich childhood of a people. For a long time the Negro had to depend upon white critics for the presentation of his folk songs, and while Allen and White and Krehbiel did excellent work, they lacked the inner knowledge and inspiration which would make their word authoritative. The authors of this book bring these essential things.\nMr. Johnson’s introduction, which runs over forty large pages, is in itself a most entertaining comment on the folk song. He characterizes “this noble music,” defends the Negro as its original creator, examines the origin and “miracle” of its production. He then speaks of our late discovery of African art in various lines both in the Motherland and in other parts of the world. He has a notable explanation of the way in which the new Christian religion came to modify African music in America and make the Negro folk song possible. The process of folk song making is explained with interesting references to “Ma” White and “Singing” Johnson.\nThere is a study of variations in solo and chorus singing, in the use of melody and rhythm and the curiously difficult art of rendering them, and the many methods of approach. Mr. Johnson discusses the difficulty of recording these spirituals because of the “curious turns and twists and quavers and the intentional striking of certain notes just a shade off the key.” The rhythm of the work songs is analyzed and that too of the “shout” songs and of the dance which has so largely disappeared now from the Negro churches. There is a special attention paid to the fact that the folk songs were harmonized by the singers and not sung in unison as some have assumed, and Mr. Rosamond Johnson and Mr. Brown have especially brought this out in their renditions, with a great deal of care and with notable success.\nThe poetry of the folk songs is illustrated by many quotations, such as “De blood came twinklin’ down,” “Sometimes I feel like a motherless child” and others. There are several pages on Negro dialect and generous acknowledgment of the credit due those who have helped preserve the Negro spiritual. “The credit for the first introduction of spirituals to the American public and the world belongs to Fisk University.” The book has words and music of 61 songs. “The collection here presented is not definitive but we have striven to make it representative of this whole field of music, to give examples of every variety of spiritual.”\nThe musical setting as done in this book one-must hear to appreciate the peculiarly high and unique quality of the work. Never before have the “Spirituals” had just this sort of original and yet true musical accompaniment. It is as though something unknown and wild and yet sensed in the song of black folk had been caught and caged forever.\nThe book is published by the Viking Press and it is hoped that it will have wide use and vogue. –W. E. B. D.\n\nThe Basis of Racial Adjustment\n\nThomas Jackson Woofter, Jr., has written and published a book called “The Basis of Racial Adjustment” which is far and away the best thing on the relations of the races in the South, that has come from a Southern white writer in our day. It is singularly fair and thoughtful; so eminently fair indeed, that after glancing at the first pages and noting the catholicity of treatment I was compelled to go through the rest of the book with a fine-tooth comb to find the lurking surrender to Southern race hate. I did not find it.\nThere were some few statements to which I might take exception: his treatment of the Dyer bill for instance, and possibly some parts of his chapter on the Negro in Government; but even here my criticism would be very, very slight.\nI know of no book by a Southern white man with which I so thoroughly and heartily agree. Take for instance, this statement: “The taxation of colored people to pay a bond issue which is spent entirely for the erection of white public schools is just as dishonest in a community as the activity of the highwayman who, with the aid of a bludgeon, converts your cash to his own uses. These are the types of action to be avoided by interracial codes.” Or this: “To assume that every member of an advantaged group is superior to every member of a disadvantaged group is a blind error, and the assumption that group differences are fixed and ineradicable for all time is equally as mistaken.” Or again this: “If all men were exactly alike, specialization would not be so effective as it is when special abilities can be developed and put to work for special ends: To argue, therefore, that the Negro and the white man are very different, is a point in favor of, rather than against, their cooperation.” And finally this: “For the white South, what is needed above all is fairness, a determination to enforce suffrage tests equitably on white and black alike, and a resolve to break away from the one-party system and to regain preéminence in the national forums of political action by building a political system around the live national issues and forgetting the more or less dead issue of Negro domination.”\nThe book is in 12 chapters and treats Racial Coöperation, Occupations, Law and Order, Government, Education, Religion and Race Contacts. It is published by Ginn and Company. –W. E. B.

    "text": "As a class Pullman porters are gentlemen in the best sense of that overworked word. They are courteous, silent and of infinite patience. Nowhere in the traveling world can one find a set of public servants who do their work so thoroughly and so well.\nThe porters are men of unusual skill. Let the doubter try to keep house and make and unmake beds and even serve meals, and at the same time satisfy the exacting and querulous tastes of two or three dozen persons, in a room 36 by 10 feet. In addition to that they have the most delicate duties and responsibilities. The womanhood of America rides undressed under their care and service and not in one case in a million have the porters even been impolite much less impertinent. The porters must decide difficult problems as to men and women, young and old, rich and poor, noisy and nervous, gamblers and prohibitionists, white and black.\nParticularly in the service of their own race have the porters done an unforgetable service. Without stirring racial animosities, with infinite tact and with sympathetic courtesy they have made it possible for twelve million insulted people to travel with a minimum of insult and inconvenience. I have travelled 50,000 miles in every state in the union and without the ministrations of the Pullman Porter I should today be dead of exhaustion and shame.\nAs it is the Pullman Company, relying on indifferent public opinion, can buy directly and indirectly the silence of the press black and white, the connivance of the United States Department of Justice and the halfhearted slobbering of white union labor so as to block the belated effort of Pullman porters to form a real and effective labor union. And in order more completely to befuddle the men who are at their economic mercy, the company is offering them, with wide gestures of benevolence, a “company union” where hand-picked lackeys “representing” the porters will smother complaints and take orders meekly. And, says this rich corporation, take this, shut up or lose your jobs.\nWell, perhaps it is better to lose this job. Perhaps we have served as porters long enough. We were good slaves; but we outgrew the job. We were good cheap servants; we are outgrowing that job. We are good porters. But if being porters means being driven slaves and alms-taking servants, then God haste the day when we outgrow that job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPullman Porters (1927)\nPullman Porters (1926)\nA Matter of Manners (1920)\nThe Black Man and Labor (1925)\nOur Economic Future (1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1926. “Again, Pullman Porters.”\nThe Crisis 31 (6): 271. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/31/06/again_pullman_porters.html."

    "text": "There has been going on in black New York during the last ten years a revolution in practical politics which few Negroes know or understand. There are two political attitudes usual to Negroes. One widely advocated by The Crisis is that of standing outside parties and throwing a mass of independent votes here or there as the candidates bid until parties will recognize Negro strength and cater to it. The weakness of this stand is that the choices after nominations are made are really few or none. Hence the real fight of the practical politicians is inside the party in the organizing of wards and precincts and the primary elections.\n\n\n\nFerdinand Q. Morton\n\n\nFerdinand Q. Morton is a man who believes in this latter method. He is frankly and avowedly a party politician. He takes human nature as he finds it and seeks to use it for his ends. These ends in his case are the recognition of manhood and ability despite color. While yet a student in school he determined to accomplish this by practical politics. He was born in Mississippi in 1881. He was educated in the public schools of Washington, D.C., and Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. He entered Harvard in 1902.\nHere he made a characteristic fight. He did excellent work in the studies he liked and was representative of his college in inter-collegiate debate. This debating was formerly allowed credit in graduation. But in Morton’s senior year this custom was stopped and he was informed he needed one-half course credits necessary to graduation. It would have been an easy matter for Morton to make up this work but he refused on principle and his refusal stands to this day.\nThis is Morton. As a student he determined to enter politics as a Democrat. He argued that a determined and resourceful Negro inside the Northern democratic party could do more to stop Southern domination than all the Negroes herded as Republicans; that the future of the Negro in America ultimately would be worked out not in the South, but in the North and West; that consequently the thing of paramount importance to win and hold civic and political equality was the division of the Negro vote between the two great political parties. He also felt the interests of the Negro imperatively required that in the urban and industrial centres of the North he should be aligned politically with the dominant parties.\nHe entered the Tammany colored organization in Harlem which consisted then largely of men contented with janitorships and small jobs supplemented by bribes on election day. Soon Robert N. Wood came to control and a new spirit rose, especially as he made young Morton his right hand man. Wood stood up and made demands and won some recognition in the party. Finally in 1915, Morton became leader of Black Tammany. In 1910 there was not a single colored policeman in New York. The race had no representation either in the State or municipal legislative branches. The only positions held by Negroes were in the Street Cleaning Department, with the exception of school teachers, not regarded as political. Today there are fifty or more Negro policemen. Hundreds of Negroes are holding positions as clerks, stenographers, typists, investigators, parole officers and court attendants. The race has representation in the Corporation Counsel’s Office and District Attorney’s Office. An alderman and a member of the State Legislature are Negro Democrats, and the party that gets the black vote in Harlem today has to fight for it desperately.\nMorton himself has risen from an indictment clerk to Civil Service Commissioner at $7500 a year. He is a district leader and sits in the inner circle of Tammany Hall and is treated and recognized as a man.\nMorton has no illusions about politics. He regards it as a selfish, desperate game where out of the clash of low interests a few great principles may be salvaged. He does not attempt to stop all gambling, bootlegging and prostitution in Harlem. But he does limit these things and protect those who wish to be decent and he has helped make Harlem a far better residence quarter than it used to be. Morton uses money in elections as every party leader does, but he uses it to purchase more decency and protection and recognition for black folk than they ever had before. He is neither demi-god nor demagogue. He is just a strong, skillful, courageous man, cynical surely, but honest and sound; and he deserves respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro in Politics (1929)\nThe Presidential Campaign (1916)\nThe Negro Politician (1928)\nThe Election (1928)\nThe Negro Party (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1925. “Ferdinand Q.

    "text": "We have assumed, with the Spring, with the beginning of our 30th semi-annual volume, with our 175th number and with the closing of a fateful quarter century, something of a new dress and a certain renewal of spirit.\nHow long may a Crisis last? one might ask, sensing between our name and age some contradiction. To which we answer: What is long? 15 or 5000 years? But even in 15 years we see curious and suggestive change. In November, 1910, we wrote:\n\nThe object of this publication is to set forth those facts and arguments which show the danger of race prejudice, particularly as manifested today toward colored people. It takes its name from the fact that the editors believe that this is a critical time in the history of the advancement of men. Catholicity and tolerance, reason and forbearance can today make the world-old dream of human brotherhood approach realization; while bigotry and prejudice, emphasized race consciousness and force can repeat the awful history of the contact of nations and groups in the past. We strive for this higher and broader vision of Peace and Good Will.\n\nThen we set forth the plan to make The Crisis (1) a newspaper, (2) a review of opinion, (3) a magazine with “a few short articles.” This initial program has unfolded itself, changed and developed. There is no longer need of a monthly newspaper for colored folk. Colored weeklies have arisen with an efficiency and scope in news-gathering that was not dreamed of in 1910. Our news therefore has transformed itself into a sort of permanent record of a few matters of widespread and historic importance. Our review of opinion continues in both “Opinion” and “Looking Glass,” but rather as interpretation than as mere quotation. Particularly has our policy changed as to articles. They have increased in number, length and authority. And above all, out of the broad vagueness of our general policy have emerged certain definite matters which we shall pursue with increased earnestness. We name them in something like the order in which they appeal to us now:\n\nEconomic Development\nAt Philadelphia, the N.A.A.C.P. made a suggestion of alliance among the laboring people of the United States across the color line. The American Federation of Labor has as yet made no active response to our overtures. Meantime, however, we are not waiting and we propose to make a crusade in The Crisis covering the next three years and taking up in succession the history and significance of the Labor Movement in the modern world, the present actual relation of Negroes to labor unions and a practical plan of future cooperation.\nPolitical Independence\nWe shall stress as never before political independence. No longer must Negroes be born into the Republican Party. If they vote the Republican ticket or any other ticket it must be because the candidates of that party in any given election make the best promises for the future and show the best record in the past. Above all we shall urge all Negroes, male and female, to register and vote and to study political ethics and machinery.\nEducation and Talent\nWe shall stress the education of Negro youth and the discovery of Negro talent. Our schools must be emancipated from the secret domination of the Bourbon white South. Teachers, white or black, in Negro schools who cannot receive and treat their pupils as social equals must go. We must develop brains, ambition, efficiency and ideals without limit or circumscription. If our own Southern colleges will not do this, and whether they do it or not, we must continue to force our way into Northern colleges in larger and larger numbers and to club their doors open with our votes. We must provide larger scholarship funds to support Negroes of talent here and abroad.\nArt\nWe shall stress Beauty—all Beauty, but especially the beauty of Negro life and character; its music, its dancing, its drawing and painting and the new birth of its literature. This growth which The Crisis long since predicted is sprouting and coming to flower. We shall encourage it in every way—by reproduction, by publication, by personal mention—keeping the while a high standard of merit and stooping never to cheap flattery and misspent kindliness.\nPeace and International Understanding\nThrough the Pan-African movement we shall press for better knowledge of each other by groups of the peoples of African descent; we shall seek wider understanding with the brown and yellow peoples of the world and thus, by the combined impact of an appeal to decency and humanity from the oppressed and insulted to those fairer races who today accidentally rule the world, we shall seek universal peace by abolishing the rivalries and hatreds and economic competition that lead to organized murder.\nThe Church\nWe shall recognize and stress the fact that the American Negro church is doing the greatest work in social uplift of any present agency. We criticise our churches bitterly and in these plaints The Crisis has often joined. At the same time we know that without the help of the Negro church neither the N.A.A.C.P. nor The Crisis could have come into being nor could they for a single day continue to exist. Despite an outworn creed and ancient methods of worship the black church is leading the religious world in real human brotherhood, in personal charity, in social uplift and in economic teaching. No such tremendous force can be neglected or ignored by a journal which seeks to portray and expound the truth. We shall essay, then, the contradictory task of showing month by month the accomplishment of black religious organization in America and at the same time seeking to free the minds of our people from the futile dogma that makes for unreason and intolerance.\nSelf-criticism\nThe Crisis is going to be more frankly critical of the Negro group. In our fight for the sheer crumbs of decent treatment we have become habituated to regarding ourselves as always right and resenting criticism from whites and furiously opposing self-criticism from within. We are seriously crippling Negro art and literature by refusing to contemplate any but handsome heroes, unblemished heroines and flawless defenders; we insist on being always and everywhere all right and often we ruin our cause by claiming too much and admitting no fault.

    "text": "Fortunately, the attention of thinkers, black and white, is being drawn to the economic crisis which faces the American Negro. Norman Thomas, the white leader of American Socialists, writing in the New Leader, said recently:\n\nJim Crow cars, poor schools, segregation, bad housing and exclusion from industrial opportunity make up the tale of the Negroes’ woes against which there is a rising tide of justifiable resentment. If anything, lack of economic opportunity in trades is growing worse and not better. This is in part a byproduct of technological unemployment which increases the pressure for jobs; in part it is due to racial prejudice. There is, for instance, a shift in the South from colored to white barbers and waiters. I have previously referred to the outrageous action of a local of the Upholsterers’ Union here in New York in refusing a card to a Negro carpet layer on account of his color. Unions that follow this practice kill their own soul.\n \nIt does not take much of a prophet to foresee the coming of a time when at last the white mill hands will strike against intolerable conditions. In the South many of the mills, especially those owned by Northern capital, will turn to Negroes. Economic war will be heightened by racial feeling. The only way to avert such fate is to organize Negro workers as well as white workers and to assert an economic solidarity now before it is too late.\n\nGeorge S. Schuyler, writing in the New York Times, says, on the other side:\n\nComforting as is the idea of a self sufficient group economy for the Negro to white people wedded to the ideal of racial separatism, we must face the facts of the situation. What the Negro needs now is not for a few philanthropists to give money to Negro schools and stop there, but for these same philanthropists, who own and control the industry and commerce of the country, to lower the color bars in their stores, factories, mills, warehouses and so forth, thus enabling the Negroes whom they have helped to educate to make a decent living and advance in the social and economic scale, not as Negroes but as Americans.\n\nMeantime, neither the Trade Unionists nor the Philanthropists are making any real movement to lift the Negro permanently away from starvation. The only way that the Negro can accomplish this through his own efforts is to begin with consumers’ co-operation. This is the reason that we have been devoting so much space lately in The Crisisto explaining this road to economic independence. Negroes have tried it several times and have failed or succeeded for obvious reasons. Chain grocery stores in Memphis failed because they were not really co-operative; they became organized for private profit and could not meet the competition of white chain stores. Efforts in Philadelphia for the purchase of coal or other articles failed.\nOn the other hand, the students’ cooperative store at Bluefield has been extraordinarily successful, not simply as a store, but as a school of business training. In New York City, there has been widespread buying of multiple homes on a co-operative basis. Some have failed; some have had fair success; a few have been very successful. There is no reason why with thought and study a large measure of success can not be obtained.\nMeantime, educated Negroes should listen carefully to the words of two men: Benjamin Stolberg, a white man, has recently emphasized the fact that the Negro problem is essential and primarily a labor problem and the next steps must be in the direction of labor organization. Abram Harris, a colored professor of Howard University, emphasizes in this number of The Crisis the attitude of trade unions and the clear path which Negro labor must follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nThe Negro and Labor (1922)\nBlessed Discrimination (1913)\nThe Migration (1917)\nDoes Organization Pay?

There is above all the question of Peace and the cessation of imperial aggression on weaker peoples.\nTo this greater field the N.A.A.C.P. has given thought and attention. But its contention is that until the radical thought of the world recognizes the role of color discrimination, it can never properly gird itself to fight for political, economic and social rights for the majority of men.\nIn other words, the color line today in hindering Democracy; is stopping economic justice; and is making real human contact impossible. It is doing this not simply by depriving colored folk of these advantages, but by the fact that through this color discrimination, the majority of white folk are also kept from democracy in politics, industry and society.\nIt is this point that radicals continually forget. Not understanding the Negro problem, they assume that political rights for white folk mean political rights for black folk; that after obtaining industrial justice, white working men will extend this to colored workingmen; that social insult and ostracism practiced against Negroes is nothing more than white class feeling based on wealth.\nThe N.A.A.C.P. has warned its radical friends and warns them now again: there is no magic in a radical program which is going to make the mass of people, rich and poor, forget their inborn prejudice against other races, especially if the races are darker hued.\nIt is, therefore, the first job of the N.A.A.C.P. and of any colored organization to get rid of this color complex; to fight color discrimination as such; to admit frankly that this is not the whole of the battle for human rights, but it is the first rampart to be taken; that until this battle is fought and won, there can be no racial political democracy in the world; there can be no complete economic justice; there can be no social equality. There can be no permanent Peace on Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nEducation (1913)\nSocial Equality (1919)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nSuffering Suffragettes (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1930. “Our Program.” The Crisis 37\n(5): 174. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/37/05/our_program.html."

How are these folks going to meet together without social equality? Are they going to refuse to speak to each other? Can they shake hands? Would a cup of tea and a biscuit overthrow the universe? Is there any chance for sympathetic friendship? May not some of them fall in love and get married?

He is a man whom many regard as a great international statesman, but for us American Negroes, he has one intolerable defect which we more clearly than other peoples can see will forever keep him from true greatness.\nHe was born and trained into the ingrained prejudice of the white South African against black folk. His whole conception of the world is that of a world not necessarily composed entirely of white people, but certainly organized, directed and established for white people. When he says that he wants white civilization to triumph in Africa, he does not mean simply that he wants civilization to triumph, it must be civilization owned by white people. The black people must share it only insofar as they cater to white peoples wants and even whims. Smuts is not so provincial as Hertzog. He does not want to face the conscience of the world with actual laws to keep Negroes from being artisans or from any real economic or political rights, or from any social status. But he wants to accomplish exactly the same thing that Hertzog wants to accomplish: that is, to put the black man back “in his place” and to keep him there. Beyond this, none of the liberalism of Jan Smuts has ever been able to stir a single step.\nIs this judgment unfair? Does it seem harsh when compared with what Mr. Smuts says in America? If it does, remember that in the Union of South Africa, nine-tenths of the natives are illiterate because of lack of school facilities; that taxation without representation is the rule in their political life, and that even in the one province where they have the right to vote, they can not vote for a Negro representative; social ostracism extends to excluding them from white churches, from getting mail at the same Post Office window, and often from walking on the sidewalks. They must carry passes when they travel; they ride in Jim Crow cars; they are kept by law from pursuing most of the profitable lines of work; they can not buy land, save in a few restricted areas; and against all this zenith of race discrimination, Jan Smuts, as Prime Minister and leading statesman, has raised no effective voice and merely calls them patient asses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPatient Asses (1930)\nThe Drive (1922)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nResolutions of the Washington Conference (1917)\nLight (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1930. “Smuts.” The Crisis 37 (2):\n63. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/37/02/smuts.html."

Back of this willingness to silence those to whom men do not wish to listen, lies stupidity, cruelty, oppression and disaster. The South, in a desperate attempt to keep the wedge of race prejudice between white and black workers, is persecuting Communists. They have resurrected in Atlanta an old slave statute and are actually threatening with death two black and four white prisoners in Atlanta. This is a counsel of despair.

    "text": "Dear Mr. Du Bois:\n\nI imagine in all appeals for your advice you rarely are called upon to aid Cupid, and certainly still more rarely for such a case as mine. Briefly, I am a white young man and am in love with a colored girl.\n\nNow to give some details so you can better understand the situation. I graduated from –––– in 1924 and she from –––– in 1923. Since then she has taught in various colored schools and I have been here most of the time teaching music, taking some college work and occasionally doing music study in ––––. I now am 25 and she is 27.\n\nMy parents are friendly to Negroes and in –––– we associated with them to quite an extent. Because I inherited no racial prejudice I presume is one main factor in my “falling in love” with a colored girl. The first time I remember seeing her was in her high school Latin class when she was a Senior. I had a passing impression that she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. She comes from one of the better colored families, of course, and is a light mulatto—too dark though to pass as white and I am of German-English descent with sandy red hair and could never pass for colored. So. The next time I remember her especially was at high school commencement when she took a $20 gold piece prize in English and was one of the honor students. I did not meet her until three years later when she was a junior in college—she 19 and I, 17. It was at her brother-inlaw’s home, with whom I was chumming at the time. Then the deed was done and I passed two or three of the happiest weeks of my life. This was around Christmas time and when I went home for the holidays the wrath fell in earnest—they had warnings of it before. With all my parents’ broadmindedness they, of course, drew the line at this not only because of race but religious reasons. I was brought up with conservative ideas on religion and to honor and obey my parents. Then began the struggle between obedience to my parents and my own desires. This struggle still continues. Of course, all our friends, colored and white, had their say—even the college and conservatory deans. They had no objections usually to her as a person but only because of racial difference.\n\nOur interests are common—music and French. It is now six years since I have seen her but we have corresponded most of the time. I still love her as intensely as at first. I am sure she was in love with me too but, you probably know and feel more keenly than I just what the but means. Some people think from some gossip passed on to me that our relations were immoral. That is not so. As I said, I am conservative and my ideas of love, marriage and divorce and religion by the modern flaming youth would be considered hopelessly mid-Victorian, Puritanical, old fogey and all the other scornful terms applied to such. I do not smoke, drink, dance, play cards, rarely go to a movie and my relations with her were just as “narrow.” Of course, since I do none of the above I never have a good time! Singing Beethoven’s ninth symphony under Dr. –––– at ––––, playing a Chopin and Mendelssohn concerto with orchestra, listening to the club give the “Messiah,” playing the “Messiah” and “Elijah” for the chorus here, listening to Roland Hayes, speaking French, and studying with the most noted Composition teacher in –––– does not come under the category of “good time!”\n\nBut that is all beside the point. The point is I still am madly in love with her and want her to be with me to share all these good things, yes, and be the mother of my children.\n\nI do not advocate racial inter-marriage in general. But, Mr. Du Bois, since she is more white than Negro why should she not marry white? It’s just as logical that way as the other. I think the standard of husband-wife relationship should be made principally on a spiritual and intellectual basis. We have had intellectual fellowship as I have said. She is more liberal in her social and religious views, but I think we agree on the fundamental—the God-Christ as atonement for sin. She is neat and attractive in her personal habits as I am. It is only the but that hinders.\n\nI want your view on inter-marriage and advice as to whether you think I should persuade her to marry me. I feel we could manage somehow. Our friends and relatives would have to accept us willy-nilly. And anyhow we would not be marrying principally each other’s relatives. A great majority of mother’s folks I have not seen for twenty years and they mean nothing special to me. It’s her I want.\n\nWe would have our own social contacts to make as any newly married couple does with its own peculiar problems.\n\nI have nearly written you several times for three or four years but never could get to the point of doing so. I presume I will act like a dear friend of father and mother’s whom I have heard them speak of very often when she asked for advice would say: “Now I want to know what you all think, but I will go ahead and do as I please afterwards.”\n\nP.S. Can you recommend any book on the subject that will be helpful?\n\nMy Dear Mr. ––––:\nI have your letter of September 23rd. My advice is that if you wish to marry the girl and she wishes to marry you, then get married.\nI assume that both of you know exactly the kind of difficulties you are going to meet. I need hardly to rehearse them. You are going to have restricted social intercourse, naturally se far as the whites are concerned; but also, so far as the colored people are concerned. In this matter, they are just as prejudiced as the whites. You are going to meet more or less insult and embarrassment in public places, if your wife is dark enough to have her color noticeable; and finally, (perhaps this is the most serious), you are going to have difficulty in finding work or in keeping it if people know that you have married a colored woman. It will be practically impossible for you to find work in any college, white or colored.\nThese are all facts which you have got to face frankly. If, before you had fallen in love you had consulted me as to the possibility, I should have pointed out these facts and emphasized them and advised you to go no further. But now the question simply is, are both of you ready, in the face of this situation, to face a world “well lost for love”?\nI know of no book which treats this matter sanely to any extent. Haldeman-Julius has just published a little Blue Book by Schuyler which takes up the subject. I have also treated it briefly in my book “Darkwater.”\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois\n\nAnd now, Reader—white, black, green or yellow, what do you say in answer to this letter? Answer and we will publish a few of the letters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCorrespondence (1926)\nInter-Marriage (1924)\nSo the Girl Marries (1928)\nColor Caste in the United States (1933)\nIntermarriage (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1930. “About Marrying.” The Crisis\n37 (1): 28–29. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/37/01/about_marrying.html."

Every effort has been made artificially to depress the value of real estate in that section, and financial institutions, including those which carry thousands of dollars belonging to colored people on deposit, have refused to renew the most reasonable mortgage propositions. If the Negro was a large capitalist like the Jew he could reap great advantage from this campaign by simply buying up this depressed property. Some day, through widespread co-operation, colored people will learn to do this.\nTo-day the real-estate sharks know that this is impossible and they are counting on this fact. Lately a second step has been taken which is to organize a holding company to control the mortgages and sometimes the property of such owners as are willing to eject Negro tenants. Of course, a little salve of hypocrisy was needed to help in the bolting of this morsel. Consequently, the white Y.M.C.A. was found ready to furnish a hall for the meeting of these philanthropists and the scheme of “Negro uplift” was announced with a flourish, a part of which proposed the colonization of all colored people in New York on the pestilential mud flats of Harlem, where with all the city’s crowding no one up to this time has been willing to live.\nBut the 100,000 colored people of New York still have the whip hand if they will only remember this: It is simply necessary for colored families and institutions to hold the property now occupied not everywhere but at certain strategic points. Of course the matter of holding property at such strategic points is difficult but possible. If the property of the Negro churches is held and the Y.M.C.A. really intends to put its building in a decent site in Harlem and the Y.W.C.A. follows suit, and if the Colored Music School Settlement buys a home—all this and other possible co-operative effort will settle the matter for a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTenements (1916)\nHomes (1912)\nInvestments (1921)\nHyde Park (1920)\nWork for Black Folk in 1914 (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “Real Estate in New York.”\nThe Crisis 8 (3): 128. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/08/03/real_estate_in_new_york.html."

Boxing gloves were invented late in that century, and in the beginning of the Nineteenth Century, John Jackson (note the prophecy!) became champion and teacher of Lord Byron and other great and titled personages.\nGradually the more brutal features of the sport were eliminated and the eighth Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules in the sixties which have since prevailed.\nThere is still today some brutality connected with boxing, but as compared with football and boat racing it may be seriously questioned whether boxing deserves to be put in a separate class by reason of its cruelty. Certainly it is a highly civilized pastime as compared with the international game of war which produces so many “heroes” and national monuments.\nDespite all this, boxing has fallen into disfavor—into very great disfavor. To see publications like the New York Times roll their eyes in shivery horror at the news from Paris (to which it is compelled to give a front page) makes one realize the depths to which we have fallen.\nThe cause is clear: Jack Johnson, successor of the Eighteenth Century John Jackson, has out-sparred an Irishman. He did it with little brutality, the utmost fairness and great good nature. He did not “knock” his opponent senseless. Apparently he did not even try. Neither he nor his race invented prize fighting or particularly like it. Why then this thrill of national disgust? Because Johnson is black. Of course, some pretend to object to Mr. Johnson’s character. But we have yet to hear, in the case of white America, that marital troubles have disqualified prize fighters or ball players or even statesmen. It comes down, then, after all to this unforgivable blackness. Wherefore we conclude that at present prize fighting is very, very immoral, and that we must rely on football and war for pastime until Mr. Johnson retires or permits himself to be “knocked out.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAbout Pugilists (1921)\nThe Third Battle of Bull Run (1912)\nViolence (1934)\nThe First Battle of Detroit (1926)\nEngland, Again (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “The Prize Fighter.”\nThe Crisis 8 (4): 181. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/08/04/prize_fighter.html."

    "text": "This fall the voters of six states certainly, and possibly eight, will vote on woman’s suffrage. In North and South Dakota, Montana, Nevada, Missouri and Nebraska elections are scheduled and attempts are being made to include this question in the fall elections of Oklahoma and Ohio. The Negro population of these eight states is 552,054. Assuming that the black voters of Oklahoma will be largely disfranchised it is, nevertheless, probable that 80,000 Negro voters will be asked to vote for or against the extension of the right of suffrage to women. How should they vote? A colored woman writes us from New Haven:\n\nMay I ask if through your columns you will answer some questions regarding Woman Suffrage and the colored woman? Our white friends come and tell us that we can do so much for ourselves when we get the ballot. Please tell me how we are going to do so much for ourselves? Will not the proportionate vote be the same as now? Should not the white women consider the betterment of the colored people as well as the foreigner who comes to our shores, because conditions are better here than in his own country? I attended a meeting a short time ago and the speaker invited questions. She had spoken of almost everything possible except the problems that vitally concern the people addressed. I asked her why the women were silent on the lynching of colored people in the South and on the unjust marriage laws and other laws discriminating against the Negro. She replied: “We have to take up the most important subjects, we cannot bother with everything under the sun and there are so many other things more important than lynching. As for marriage laws, we have to have some laws regulating marriage between races. For my part, I do not believe in marriage between Americans and Europeans.” Now, Mr. Editor, this woman is a highly educated woman, but does not that sound like shallow reasoning? Are not Americans made up of all nations of Europe? Now what are we trying to do for ourselves if that is the way that the women who are working for votes for women feel towards the problem of the colored woman? Have we any right to believe that they will work for our cause after they get the ballot, if they do not feel willing to take up such questions now? Has the past history of our race anything to give us such encouragement?\n\nLet us answer frankly, there is not the slightest reason for supposing that white American women under ordinary circumstances are going to be any more intelligent, liberal or humane toward the black, the poor and unfortunate than white men are. On the contrary, considering what the subjection of a race, a class or a sex must mean, there will undoubtedly manifest itself among women voters at first more prejudice and petty meanness toward Negroes than we have now. It is the awful penalty of injustice and oppression to breed in the oppressed the desire to oppress others. The southern white women who form one of the most repressed and enslaved groups of modern civilized women will undoubtedly, at first, help willingly and zealously to disfranchize Negroes, cripple their schools and publicly insult them.\nNevertheless, votes for women must and ought to come and the Negroes should help bring this to pass for these reasons: 1. Any extension of democracy involves a discussion of the fundamentals of democracy. 2. If it is acknowledged to be unjust to disfranchise a sex it cannot be denied that it is absurd to disfranchise a color. 3. If the North enfranchises women, the proportion of unselfish intelligent voters among Negroes will be increased, and the proportion of Negro voters whom white politicians have trained to venality will be decreased. 4. If when the North enfranchises women the South refuses, or enfranchises only the whites, then the discrepancy between North and South in the votes cast will be even greater than now; at present the southern white voter has from five to seven times the power of the northern voter. How long would the nation endure an increase or even a doubling of this power? It would not take long before southern representatives in Congress would be cut down or colored women enfranchised. 5. Granting that first tendencies would make the woman voter as unfair in race rights as the man, there would be in the long run a better chance to appeal to a group that knows the disadvantage and injustice of disfranchisement by experience, than to one arrogant and careless with power. And in all cases the broader the basis of democracy the surer is the universal appeal for justice to win ultimate hearing and sympathy.\nTherefore: Votes for Women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOhio (1912)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nVotes for Women (1918)\nVotes for Women (1912)\nWoman’s Suffrage (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “Votes for Women.”\nThe Crisis 8 (4): 179–80. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/08/04/votes_for_women.html."

    "text": "Once upon a time there lay a land in the southern seas; a dark, grim land, walled well against the world. And in that land rose three rivers and a fourth, all flowing out to seek the sea. One river was born amid the Lakes and Mountains of the Moon, sun-kissed, snow-capped, and fled to the northward silent, swiftly; it clambered over the hills and swam the marshes. It threaded the sands—the narrow, choking sands that grew hotter and narrower as it went; yet the river swept on to wider, greener fields, to a laughing plain until through many mouths it burst like a rocket to the Middle Sea with all its myriads of men.\nIn the wake of the river came dark men creeping, dancing, marching, building, until their pyramids and temples dotted the land and dared the Heavens, and the Thought of their souls and cities was the Beginning of the World.\nFar, far away to westward another river leapt and sang and lightly turned its back upon the Sea, rushing to northward. But the grim desert shrieked in its fastnesses crying “Not here!” So the river whirled southward till the black forests cried in their gloom, “Not here!” The river bowed and circled westward. Sullenly, silently, yet proudly, she swept into the western sea. As she swept she sang low minor melody; as she sang she scattered gold carelessly to the black children. But ere she died in the depth of the sea she gave to her strongest and blackest sons, Iron—the precious gift of Iron. They fashioned it cunningly and welded it in faery forms and sent it to the ends of earth to make all men awake. And men awoke. They awoke on the cunning breast of the river’s self and kingdom on kingdom arose until the empire of the Songhay rivaled the empires of the world. The sound of the might of Negro land echoed in Carthage and grew in Numidia and gave fairy tales to the Middle Sea.\nAway to the south and eastward and below the Mountains of the Moon the third broad river heard her sisters hurrying seaward. North and westward they had gone but she turned to the eternal east. Golden she lifted up her golden hands and stretched to Ophir, Punt and Tarshish her long, lithe finger. Her voice rose mighty in song until with a million stars in her throat she dropped wild singing in the southern sea and shuddered to the vastness of its silence.\nHer black children sat in mine, fortress, temple and flowering field and traded with dark traders beyond the India Sea, till lo: out of the north came a cry, a cry like the anguish of a soul. For back in the bowels of the land men heard the running of three rivers and rushed away madly; for they were those that would not hear and could not see. On they ran, on, on and eastward ringing their spears and crying their great, awful cry of war. As locusts swarming they passed the north of the glooming forest with its dim red faerie; eastward they looked upon the inland oceans and southward they sent their war cry reeling to the Mountains of the Moon.\nThere came a shouting in the wilderness and again as swarming bees onward they came, and again the war cry echoed to the stars. Over the ruin of things that were passed that black and human flood until its angry surf dashed into the vast, red Heart of the Land, and knew the haunted spell-cursed realm of the Last River. Mighty was this last of rivers—a river of rivers, an endless lacing and swirling and curling and swelling and streaming of wild, weird waters beneath the giant jungle, where the lion, the leopard and the elephant slept with the long, slim snake.\nHand in hand and voice to voice these waters whirled in one vast circle within the bosom of the land saying their incantations. They shouldered past the mountains and sang past all the seas, then shunning the glaring desert and ingathering themselves to one swarming flood they thrilled and thundered on the sea. Snake-like and lion strong they gathered the children, the little dark and weeping children, and lo, beyond on swelling waters rose a hoarse, harsh cry and slim and sail-like fingers beckoned to the westward deeps. The river paused and rose red and reeking in the sunlight—thundered to the sea—thundered through the sea in one long line of blood, with tossing limbs and the echoing cries of death and pain.\nOn, on! the bloody waters, with those pale ghost fingers of ship and sail, with gold and iron, hurt and hell, rolled, swelled and tumbled, until the laughing islands of the western sea grew dark and dumb with pain and in the world, the great new world a Sorrow was planted and the Sorrow grew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEaster-Emancipation 1863-1913 (1913)\nThe Burden of Black Women (1914)\nHelping Africa (1924)\nThe Fruit of the Tree (1913)\nLittle Portraits of Africa (1924)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “The Story of Africa.”\nThe Crisis 8 (5): 234–35. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/08/05/story_of_africa.html."

    "text": "During the debate in the Senate of the United States on the joint resolution proposing to amend the Constitution by extending the suffrage to women, the race question obtruded itself and, as a result, many Senators, by their speeches and votes, put themselves on record. This record will be of interest to Negro voters throughout the country.\nTwo amendments to the resolution were offered, both intended to repeal the Fifteenth Amendment. The first, proposed by Vardaman, of Mississippi, was to insert after the word “sex” the following:\n\nBut in all other respects the right of citizens to vote shall be controlled by the State wherein they reside.\n\nThe second, offered by Williams, of Mississippi, proposed to amend by inserting before the word “citizens” the word “white,” so that, as amended, the section would read:\n\nSection 1.  The right of white citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\n\nOf the Senators from the South the following only signified their opposition to the repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment: Bradley, of Kentucky; Du Pont, of Delaware; Chilton, of West Virginia; Fall, of New Mexico; Catron, of New Mexico; Ashhurst, of Arizona. Thornton, of Louisiana, opposed the Vardanian amendment, but expressly stated that he was ready at any time to support a straight resolution repealing the Fifteenth Amendment. Saulsbury, of Delaware, did not vote, but was announced as favoring both amendments. Reed, of Missouri, opposed the Williams amendment, but he had already voted for the Vardanian amendment. Bankhead, Clark, of Arkansas, Robinson, Culberson, Fletcher, Goff, Simmons, Smith, of Maryland, Smith, of Arizona, and Stone, of Missouri, did not vote and were not announced as on either side.\nOf the Northern Senators, Meyers, of Montana, voted for both amendments. Newlands and Pittman, of Nevada, voted for the Williams amendment.\nDuring the debate Pittman, of Nevada, stated that he opposed the suffrage amendment because he realized that its passage would embarrass the South in its treatment of the Negro problem, and because he did not care to endanger the chances of future anti-Japanese legislation by alienating the South on the Negro question. His colleague. Newlands, in a speech in support of the woman’s suffrage amendment, took occasion to state his belief in Negro disfranchisement and white supremacy. Borah, of Idaho, in a long speech and in numerous shorter ones, opposed the suffrage amendment on the ground that it would not be enforced in the South as to colored women and that he would not be a party to writing into the Constitution another provision which he knew would not be enforced. Bryan, of Florida, and the two Mississippi Senators supported the proposed repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment by their speeches. This proposition was opposed by Bristow, Townsend, Gallinger and Clapp.\nOf the Senators who by their stand on this question showed themselves as opposed to the interests of the colored people, only Newlands, of Nevada, comes up for re-election this year. Unfortunately, the Negro vote in his State is of slight importance. It should, however, be cast solidly against the re-election of Senator Newlands. Of Senators who have on this and other matters shown that they have the interests of the colored people at heart, the following come up for re-election: Bradley, of Kentucky; Bristow, of Kansas: Gallinger, of New Hampshire; Jones, of Washington; Sherman, of Illinois.\nIn the recent fight for the Jones amendment to the Smith-Lever bill the issue was not clearly drawn, because the introduction of the Shafrotli amendment caused persons who otherwise would have voted for the Jones amendment to oppose it. However, one Republican Senator, Brady, of Ohio, intimated throughout his debate his opposition. He also comes up for re- election this fall and should be opposed by the colored voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe White Primary (1911)\nMississippi (1920)\nThe Truth (1911)\nThe Ballot (1919)\nGet Ready (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “Senators’ Records.”\nThe Crisis 8 (2): 77–78. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/08/02/senators_records.html."

    "text": "Come, all my father’s children, and sit beside my knee, here with this child of mine, and listen:\nHave you ever seen a soldier? It is a brave sight, is it not? Once upon a time, many, many years before your dear little curly heads were born, I remember seeing an army that marched because a King was visiting an Emperor. Berlin was joy mad. Houses streamed with color and music reeled and rioted. Then came the army. Tall, handsome men, all gold and silver and broadcloth, sworded, spurred and plumed, led on horses that curvetted and tossed their shining bits. (Do you not love a horse with his great, sweet eyes and quivery. shining softness?) Next came the soldiers, erect, rigid, “Eyes left!” Pit-pat. pit-pat! Clasping their little innocent guns. Next came the artillery: files of wildly prancing horses dragging long leaden things. How the crowd roared. The King bowed to the Emperor and the Emperor bowed to the King, and there rose a great cry of pride and joy and battle from the people. With that cry I seemed suddenly to awake. I somehow saw through; (you know sometimes how you seem to sec, but arc? blind until something happens and you really see?)\nI saw then what I see now. I saw and see the WAR that men said could not be.\nGone was all the brave tinsel, the glitter, sheen and music. The men trudged and limped, naked and dirty, with sodden, angry, distorted faces; their eyes were sunken and bloodshot, with murder in them; they staggered over corpses and severed arms and feet and dead horses and they carried—not little innocent guns, but little innocent children; they dragged, not pale and leaden guns, but pale and bounden women, and before them staggered and crept old women and grandfathers, the sick and the maimed, the weak and the half-grown boys and girls.\nI heard the cry that hovered over this fearsome army: it was a wail of hunger and crime, of thirst and pain and death, and the cry rose and met an answering cry that came from beyond the forest to the West.\nTwo toddling children slipped from their fathers’ arms and met in the gloom of that forest, where the beasts cowered and livid, disbodied hands seemed to creep in the darkness.\n“Mother,” they whispered.\n“Mama,” they cried.\n“Mutterchen,” they sobbed.\nWild with horror two bound mothers beat their naked hands against the gun-carriages, groping and struggling through the gloom, as death flamed through their hearts.\nThen the armies met. Two fathers leapt from the two armies ahead and each seized the other’s child. They strangled and crushed and maimed and murdered it, till each baby lay pale, limp and dead.\n(Nay, shrink not, my children; horrible as the tale may be, the truth is worse and you must know it.)\nThen War was loose. Then six million human beings left their fields of golden grain and the busy hum of their factories and taking their own children for weapons dashed them against the trees and the lampposts and the churches and wallowed and gasped in their blood!\nCome, all my father’s children and hear how beyond the blue mists of the Everlasting Sea, the-mothers mad with hunger, grief and pain, are fronting the blood-stained heavens with bared and haunted breasts and are shrieking:\n“Why?”\n“Why?”\nTheir shriek is the booming of guns, and the booming of cannon is the shriek of mothers.\nAnd you must answer, Children of Peace, you must answer!\nYou must cry: “There is no why!” “The cause of War is Preparation for War.”\n“The cause of Preparation for War is the Hatred and Despising of Men, your and my Brothers.”\n“War is murder in a red coat.”\n“War is raped mothers and bleeding fathers and strangled children.”\n“War is Death, Hate, Hunger and Pain!”\n“Hell is War!”\nAnd when you believe this with all your little hearts;\nAnd when you cry it across the seas and across the years with all your little voices—\nThen shall the mothers of all dead children hear;\nThen shall the Sisters of all dead Brothers hear; then shall the Daughters of all dead Fathers hear; then shall the Women rise and say:\n“War is done.”\n“Henceforward and forever there shall be no organized murder of men, for the children we bear shall be the Children of Peace, else there shall be no children.”\nAmen!\nBut cry, little children, cry and cry loud and soon, for until you and the Mothers speak, the men of the world bend stupid and crazed beneath the burden of hate and death. Behold, this old and awful world is but one slaughter-pen, one tale of innocent blood and senseless hate and strife.\nLook yonder! In the gloomy forest all is still, save here a red and flickering flame and there a last trembling sob. Only one living thing passes across the night: a horse—a gaunt, sweating horse, with bloody nostrils, great pain-struck eyes, and bowels trailing on the earth. He hears his Emperor bugling “Victory!” to the King. Turning he staggers toward him and whimpers as he goes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThirteen (1918)\nThe Slaughter of the Innocents (1918)\nForward (1920)\nA Philosophy in Time of War (1918)\nPeace (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1914. “Of the Children of Peace.”\nThe Crisis 8 (6): 289–90. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/08/06/of_children_of_peace.html."

    "text": "To the honest seeker for light the puzzling thing about the Southern situation is the absolutely contradictory statements that are often made concerning conditions. For instance, the New York Evening Post is taken to task by the Norfolk (Ya.) Landmark for assuming that Southern colored men are largely disfranchised. The Virginia paper says “No Negro in Virginia can be kept from voting, provided he measures up to the same requirements for the exercising of that right that the white man must. The laws of the State will protect him in the right should election officials deny it him. That Negroes in this State may freely qualify to vote is fully attested by the fact that thousands of them do vote.” Again, the New Orleans Picayune declares with regard to the complaint of disfranchisement. “The arrant and absolute falsity of the specification in regard to the ballot is seen in the fact that every legal bar to the exercise of the ballot applies to whites and Negroes alike. Every elector (voter) must either be able to read and write or, in case of illiteracy, he must pay taxes on ordinary assessable property of the minimum value of $300. These laws are strictly in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution of the United States, and have been so pronounced by the courts.”\nJust so in earlier days before legal disfranchisement, paper after paper and orator after orator declared that the Negro could and did vote without let or hindrance.\nDespite this, every intelligent person in the United States knows that these statements are false. The Southern testimony to this is itself open and convincing. Not only have we Mr. Tillman’s frank and picturesque testimony on the past, but today the Richmond (Va.) Leader says that all is well in Virginia “since we disfranchised the Negro”; Congressman Underwood of Alabama says the Alabama Negro “does not count for anything politically” in that State; a prominent judge on the Mississippi bench says “The Negroes in Mississippi do not vote and should not,” and it is a matter of plain official record in Louisiana that of over 150,000 Negro males 21 years of age and over (of whom nearly 70,000 could read and write) there were in 1908 only 1,743 registered as voters, and these were disfranchised by the “White Primary” system.

    "text": "There is without doubt a large criminal and semi-criminal class among colored people. This is but another way of saying that the social uplift of a group of freedmen is a serious task. But it is also true, and painfully true, that the crime imputed carelessly and recklessly against colored people gives an impression of far greater criminality than the facts warrant.\nTake, for instance, a typical case: A little innocent schoolgirl is brutally murdered in New Jersey. A Negro vagabond is arrested. Immediately the news is heralded from East to West, from North to South, in Europe and Asia, of the crime of this black murderer. Immediately a frenzied, hysterical mob gathers and attempts to lynch the poor wretch. He is spirited away and the public is almost sorry that he has escaped summary justice. Without counsel or friends, the man is shut up in prison and tortured to make him confess. “They did pretty near everything to me except kill me,’ whispered the wretched man to the first friend he saw.\nFinally, after the whole black race in America had suffered aspersion for several weeks, sense begins to dawn in Jersey. After all, what proof was there against this man? He was lazy, he had been in jail for alleged theft from gypsies, he was good natured, and he drank whiskey. That was all. Yet he stayed in jail under no charge and under universal censure. The coroner’s jury found no evidence to indict him. Still he lay in jail. Finally the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People stepped in and said, “What are you holding this man for?” The Public Prosecutor got red in the face and vociferated. Then he went downtown, and when the habeas corpus proceedings came and the judge asked again: “Why are you holding this man?” the prosecutor said chirpily, “For violating election laws,” and brought a mass of testimony. Then the judge discharged the prisoner from the murder charge and congratulated the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People—but the man is still in jail.\nSuch justice is outrageous and such methods disgraceful. Black folk are willing to shoulder their own sins, but the difference between a vagabond and a murderer is too tremendous to be lightly ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCrime (1920)\nCourts and Jails (1932)\nLogic (1914)\nDeception (1916)\nMob Tactics (1927)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “The Old Story.” The Crisis\n1 (3): 20. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/03/old_story.html."

    "text": "There is an artist in New York who rose from the humblest circumstances and now lives in a suburb of the city. In his rise he has evidently learned the essentials of democracy, for his wife in an interview says that they want separate Negro schools in that suburb. They need to have them, but a very foolish law interfered, she laments:\n\nWe got along here very well with our separate Negro school. At the same time the Catholic Church maintained a parochial school, to which most of the Italian children went, so that public schools had practically no problem to solve at all as to the commingling of children of different races.\n\nExquisite! Add to this the demand for separate Asiatic schools in California and we have a splendid start; we have but to demand, then, separate public schools for the rich and cultured. Why should Reginald De Courcey sit in school with Skinny Flynn and Isaac Baumgarten? Perish the thought! Then, too, we must in time distinguish between the Rich and the New Rich, the Real Thing and the Bounder. For instance, why should a Kentucky drummer presume to school his children with the lineal descendant of a patroon—but, noticing a deep red flush on the cheek of the artist’s wife, we forbear to push this point. We merely pause to ask: What is democracy anyhow?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSegregation (1910)\nReconstruction (1919)\nLynchings and Mobs (1921)\nNegro Education (1918)\nEducation (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Rampant Democracy.”\nThe Crisis 1 (4): 21. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/04/rampant_democracy.html."

    "text": "THE amount of positive ignorance on the situation of the colored people in America is simply appalling. Take, for instance, the matter of the education of children. The Lawrence (Mass.) American says with great complacence: “The education of the Negro in the South is now on a sound and safe basis. Its scope is broad and sensible, training him both mentally and industrially, not forgetting his moral elevation as well. It is a task being well done, and the results should be effective in wearing down the edge of the racial prejudice below the Mason and Dixon line.”\nA leading colored paper, the Indianapolis Freeman, also asserts that there is no effort “to deny Negroes education in America. It will be admitted that there are now and then inconveniences, perhaps owing to prejudice in localities, but not to such an extent as to deprive the Negro child of some education, if so desired.”\nThese writers believe what they say. They believe it because they want to believe it, however, and not because they have made any effort to get at the facts. Yet the facts are perfectly plain. The last published report of the United States Commissioner of Education, 1909, gives these figures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColored children, 5-18 years of age\n3,964,398\n\n\nNumber of these daily attending schools\n1,035,747\n\n\nPercentage\n33.7%\n\n\nAverage length of school term for colored and white children in the South, per year\n24 weeks\n\n\n\nThis means that only one-third the Negro children 5-18 years of age are attending school and it is fair to assume that less than half of those 5-14 years of age are in school. Moreover, the Negro schools being shorter than the white schools do not average as much as five months a year.\nThese are the official figures compiled for public consumption by white Southern officials. The State supervisor of rural schools of South Carolina says openly in his last report: “It has been my observation that the Negro schools of South Carolina are for the most part without supervision of any kind. Frequently the county superintendent does not know where they are located, and sometimes the district board cannot tell where the school is taught!”\nIf once we go behind the official admissions the picture is even worse. As we pointed out in the January Crisis, in one Alabama county out of 10,758 Negro children only 1,000 were in school. As to Louisiana, this is the way V. P. Thomas dissects the school report:\n\nThe school term for white schools is over eight months long; the school term for colored schools is less than five months long. There are high schools for white children in every parish, and no high schools for colored children in any parish at the present time, except Southern University in New Orleans. The high schools all run nine months. The average monthly salary of the white female teacher is $50.80; that of the colored female teacher $28.67.   The white and colored populations are very nearly equal, yet the white teachers’ salaries amount to $2,404,062.54; the colored teachers’ salaries amount to $202,251.13. The value of all schoolhouses, sites and furniture for whites is $6,503,019.57; the value of all schoolhouses, sites and furniture for colored is $273,147.50. The total value of school property for colored use is $266,281.40. Number of wagonettes for whites only in use, 210; average cost per month of operating wagonettes, $7,272.37. In the sparsely settled country school districts the State furnishes wagonettes for the transportation of white children to and from school. The value of the wagonettes is $21,624.95, and the cost of operating them is $54,000.51.   Average number of white children transported per month per wagonette, 7.2; average cost per month per child transported, $2.19. Number of white children transported in wagonettes 4,088 for more than eight months at $2.19 per month per child. Under this way of encouraging white children to attend, the enrollment of white children in the public schools is 184,955. Without any such encouragement and under adverse circumstances and with the certainty that there will be less than a five months’ term for colored schools, the enrollment of colored children in the public schools is 78,862. Twice as many could enroll, but if they did they would have to sit upon one another for want of accommodation.\n\nIn the teeth of such facts ignorant editors like those above laud the Negro public schools, but leaders of education like President Edmund J. James of the University of Illinois say flatly and fearlessly: “In no other nation claiming to be civilized is there at the present time so large a population in such educational degradation as the American Negro!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEducation (1930)\nSegregation (1910)\nNegro Education (1918)\nEmployment (1932)\nSchools (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Education.” The Crisis 1\n(4): 16–17. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/04/education.html."

    "text": "In 1844 the general conference of the Methodist Church sitting in New York City, by a vote of 110 to 68, suspended from his functions Bishop Andrew who had come into possession of slaves through marriage.\nThe result was the forming of the Methodist Church, South, in 1845. After emancipation this latter church set off its former slave members into a separate church. The Methodist Church of the North having in a previous century and later lost the colored members of the African and Zion Methodist Churches, began to welcome the freedmen to its doors and to help in their education. The result is that this church to-day has over 300,000 colored members.\nQuestions concerning the treatment of these members have continually arisen. So long as they could be treated as objects of purely missionary effort there was much enthusiasm. More and more, however, these colored men demanded recognition as men. In 1848 the general conference allowed itinerant colored ministers; in 1852 a colored conference was erected; in 1856 the first colored missionary bishop went to Africa. In 1860 the colored conferences were raised to full power and eight years later Negro delegates sat in the general convention. From 1872 until to-day the question of a black bishop has bothered the conference and several candidates have been voted for. Colored men have been elected to general offices in seven cases, but always with authority over Negro affairs.\nHere at last the church stands. But a new question appears. Gradually a better feeling has grown up between the Northern and Southern white sections of the church and many dream of reuniting the two halves. But—and here’s the rub—the price of amalgamation is for the Northern branch to give up their principles on the Negro question. Southern white servants of Christ will hardly sit in general conference with black men and certainly Negro presiding elders and bishops would be unthinkable.\nTherefore (and is not this characteristically American?) the Methodist Church is here and there quietly and cautiously suggesting to its black members: “Would you not like to withdraw and be separate and have your own bishops?”\n“Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCrime (1918)\nThe Negro Church (1912)\nMissionaries (1929)\nThe Church and the Negro (1913)\nThree Churches (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “The Methodist Church, North.”\nThe Crisis 1 (5): 17. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/05/methodist_church_north.html."

    "text": "Any well-intentioned American cans argue this way: the present disfranchisement laws of the South are unfair, but in time, after the special exemptions under the grandfather clause have run out, justice will prevail and all men will vote under educational and property restrictions.\nThe prospect for this outcome is not reassuring, because few people realize that even the colored voters of States like Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, who pass the present restrictions, are disfranchised again by the white primary.\nIt is this fact, which has been seldom discussed, that explains many contradictions. Senator Percy, of Mississippi, says, for instance, “There is no such thing as Negro suffrage in Mississippi and never will be as long as the white men of the State stand together.” The Atlanta Constitution said repeatedly in the first Hoke Smith campaign:\nNegroes are already disfranchised in Georgia—why pass a constitutional amendment? A judge on the bench of another State said in a decision:\n“Negroes do not vote in this State and ought not to, but they ought to get justice.” At the same time white Southerners declare that in every Southern State the Negro who complies with the law can vote.\nWhat is the answer to this paradox? It is simple: the “White Primary.”\nProfessor Macy, of Iowa, one of the foremost students of our politics, says:\n\nThe Democratic party in the Southern States has thus come to be an aggregation of white citizens organized to maintain continued ascendency in State and local government. It lacks an essential characteristic of political parties in a free democracy, in that it does not rest its claim to such dominion upon the unrestrained choice of a free voting constituency. It is organized, not to debate, but to govern. As a political party, it makes and enforces party rules which have the force of law, and the power of the State is thus made to contribute to the strengthening of the party’s hold upon the State. … So it happens that the primary election, which, in legal form merely nominates Democratic candidates for office, is, from the standpoint of the voter, the real election whereby local, State, and congressional officers are placed in positions of responsibility and power. It is, in fact, the one election of importance in the State, and the law leaves entirely to the decision of party officers the question who shall be considered qualified to cast a vote. … Party officials have entire charge of registration, the preparation of ballots, and the receiving and counting of votes.\n\nTwo quotations will confirm this statement. The constitution of the Democratic party in South Carolina says of the primary election:\n\nAt this election only Democratic white voters who have been residents of the State twelve months and the county sixty days preceding the next general election, and such Negroes as voted the Democratic ticket in 1876, and as have voted the Democratic ticket continuously since, to be shown by the certificates of ten white Democratic voters, who will pledge themselves to support the nominee of such elections, may vote.\n\nThe Georgia Democrats declare:\n\nAll white electors, who have duly registered according to law, irrespective of past political affiliations, and who intend in good faith to abide by the result of the party primary and support the nominations thereby, are hereby declared qualified, and are invited to participate in said primary election.\n\nA friend of mine asked a prominent Florida white man in 1910:\n“Are there any Negro Democrats?”\nHe answered with the utmost surprise:\n“Why, we wouldn’t let a Negro vote the Democratic ticket.”\nIn other words, by erecting a single party as a State within a State and giving it absolute private control of primary elections and the absolute right to say who shall vote in the election there arises the complete disfranchisement of any group the majority wills. For instance, Louisiana disfranchises all of her Negro voters except 1,743, and then by the “White Primary” system she disfranchises the rest. Such a system must, of course, be backed by a strong invincible public opinion to be successful. It involves two elections—the second merely a formal registering of the decision of the first. Since, however, the first election is a party affair there can be no official returns. Moreover, the State cannot vote upon the great questions of the day that divide the nation into parties. Secondly, the official election becomes simply an unimportant and perfunctory thing.\nHow long before this curious combination of law and mob rule, backed by class and race hatred, will be used in other parts of this nation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Truth (1911)\nRegister and Vote (1917)\nDisenfranchisement (1926)\nThe Negro and the Land (1914)\nSenators’ Records (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “The White Primary.”\nThe Crisis 1 (5): 20--21. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/05/white_primary.html."

The New York Times says:\n\nVery often the question, ‘Is this seat taken?’ which it is well enough to ask before sitting down beside a stranger, is answered with a gruff and resentful ‘Yes,’ though obviously it is not then ‘taken’ by anything more than a hat or a newspaper or a valise. This reply is impudent, and it ought to result in a ‘scene,’ more or less vivacious, every time it is made.\n\nThis is the advice to commuters: Make a scene “more or less vivacious” every time!\nThere is another serious matter which calls our attention: Two thousand five hundred colored men have been lynched in this land in the last 25 years. On this matter we have not been advised to make a scene “more or less vivacious,” but on the contrary, a large number of good and influential men have united to deprecate complaint or agitation. Many colored men are disposed to accept this advice, but on the heels of it comes the action of Mexico. One—just one—Mexican was burned in Texas. “We thought no more of it,” says the Associated Press dispatch naively, but the land of Mexico was moved from center to circumference; denunciation and even mob violence was threatened and all over one criminal.\nCan we black men fail to contrast with this the recent interview with a distinguished American in Vienna? He is reported in the columns of Die Zeit to say: “There was no race war in America over the Johnson-Jeffries fight. Not more than a dozen Negroes were killed and now the whole matter is forgotten.”\nAll of which shows how advice may be tempered by race prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Matter of Manners (1920)\nVisitors (1928)\nVital Statistics (1912)\nA Statement (1919)\nSouthern Papers (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1910. “Advice.” The Crisis 1 (2):\n21. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/02/advice.html."

    "text": "It is curious how old ideas recur and ancient ones persist. In earliest times the easiest way to prevent trouble was to separate the combatants—put space between them, herd them in separate sections and territories. So long as the world was wide this was feasible and often effective. As the world grows narrower, it is not so easy and as it grows more civilized it is less advisable. For after all culture is the meeting and learning of men.\nFor instance, one meets on street or car an impudent colored man. He has some education, he has good clothes and he feels his importance and asserts himself. Like a flash you rush to the conclusion: Such a man ought not to associate with white folks until he learns good manners. But hold; suppose all the ill-mannered white folk were segregated, would that improve the world’s deportment? Certainly not. It would make it distinctly and dangerously worse. It is association with the well-bred that brings manners.\nHow has America come to improve the manners which justly shocked Dickens and Mrs. Martineau? By associating with gentlemen and ladies here and in Europe. It was and is a bit hard on Europe, but it is a great boon for the world.\nIn America by the accident of color it is possible roughly to separate much ignorance and bad manners by drawing the color line. But it is a barbarous and unjust and unwise expedient, and it leads to the extreme Ghetto idea. The half-trained white Baltimore tradesman reasons logically: If I can push black men out of my way in train and street car, in theatre and art gallery, in church and park, why can I not segregate them in a Ghetto? The Atlanta “cracker,” newborn to good wages and political power, is jealous of ambitious black folk. If he can take a black man’s vote away why can he not take his home and force him back to the alley, whence he came?\nIt is time that the thought and conscience of America took a firm stand on these matters and stopped now and forever such dangerous and undemocratic doctrine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nJim Crow (1919)\nSegregation (1910)\nThe Strength of Segregation (1913)\nSegregation (1934)\nSeparation (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1910. “The Ghetto.” The Crisis 1\n(2): 21--22. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/02/ghetto.html."

Then they began to expand into parallel streets, one of which was McCulloh. They had been told that “money talks,” and that the surest road to respect in America was financial success. The result was inevitable.

Such people rightly herald the recent peonage decision of the Supreme Court, they commend the saving of Pink Franklin’s life, they point to many other instances of help and good will on the part of Southern whites.\nThese things are true and deserve wide currency; to conceal or neglect them would be wrong.

There is no other way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Truth (1912)\nPink Franklin (1911)\nA Statement (1919)\nPeonage (1927)\nThe Old Story (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “The Truth.” The Crisis 1\n(6): 21–22. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/06/truth.html."

    "text": "A curious thing happened at Harvard last fall. A boy walked from Mississippi and sought to enter the college because he wanted to learn to write.\n“Certainly. Why not?” asks the reader.\nWell—he was black.\n“Oh,” says the reader, as the dean of the college said, “why didn’t he go to an industrial school?”\n“Because,” said Smith Jones, “I want to study literature and become a poet.”\n“Why not become a carpenter?”\n“Because I don’t want to.”\n“Is not a trade honorable?”\n“Yes; but the trade I want is writing in numbers.”\n“But can you write?”\nNow, the strange thing is that Smith Jones has the gift of song. “My song floats softly up to thee,” he sings to Ethiopia in verses that halt yet have the feel of poetry—not that song is to be compared with potatoes—for potatoes are the end of song (or is song the end of potatoes?). At any rate, why shouldn’t such a boy be heralded, pushed onward and encouraged? He aspires. Why does not America cry Hurrah! The reason lies deep, but the reason is there, and it exercises itself again and again. “There is one place in this land for black men. We want no exceptions. Exceptions make the Negro problem.” Curious. How like to well-known echoes of the past. How like, too, sounds Smith Jones’ life; he was born in a Mississippi cotton field; he supported his mother, sent his sister to school. Then at last came his chance. He got to Louisville and worked at service. Then he printed his Ode to Ethiopia and came to Indianapolis. There the Star published his “Ode to the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument” which James Whitcomb Riley and other writers praised. Yet when they saw the black face of the poet they sighed. It was no use to try there, so the black boy started for Harvard with thirty-four cents in his pocket and a bundle of “Odes to Ethiopia!” He rode on engines, skulked, starved and walked, and finally was arrested in Worcester, Mass., a dirty, black, redeyed vagabond, and sent to the work-house. “I am a poet,” he protested, “not a tramp;” but the guard dropped his letter to the editors in the waste paper basket and grinned. Finally, on a dark night he came to Harvard Square. He saw its dim trees and scattered buildings and, venturing in the yard, was promptly arrested again and clapped into jail. Oh! our brave and efficient police!\nThis time his judge was a man. While his jailers were proving beyond peradventure that any man whose whole luggage consisted of a bag of poems was either a vagabond or a fool, the judge was reading his poems. So he went free, “on probation.” At last a man came forward and put Jones into the Boston Latin School, where he is now preparing for Harvard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro College (1933)\nThe Younger Literary Movement (1924)\nNegro Writers (1920)\nOur Book Shelf (1925)\nSchools (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1911. “Smith Jones.” The Crisis 1\n(6): 22. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/01/06/smith_jones.html."

There can be nothing like it. It is the earth and skies gone stark and raving mad. The mountains up-twirled, disbodied and inverted stand on their peaks and throw their bowels to the skies. Their earth is air — their ether blood-red rock engreened. You stand upon their roots and fall into their pinnacles a mighty mile.\nBehold this mauve and purple mocking of time and space. See yonder peak! No human foot has trod it. Into that blue shadow only the eye of God has looked. Listen to the accents of that gorge which mutters: “Before Abraham was, I am.” Is yonder wall a hedge of black, or is it the rampart between Heaven and hell? I see greens — is it grass or giant pines? I see specks that may be boulders. Ever the winds sigh and drop into those sun-swept silences. Ever the gorge lies motionless, unmoved, until I fear. It is an awful thing, unholy, terrible. It is human — some mighty drama unseen, unheard, is playing there its tragedies or mocking comedy and the laugh of endless years is shrieking onward from peak to peak, unheard, unechoed and unknown."

They complain at themselves and criticise, but they are pulsing and alive with a new ambition and determinedness which were to me astounding."

The audience was small and the people were not sure of my message and purpose; but they themselves were awakening and they showed new homes and enterprises with pardonable pride.\nTacoma will always seem to me like a place of home coming. I have seldom come to a strange city with so intimate an understanding and sense of fellowship. The audience was white and black and sympathetically blended. The mayor came and spoke and ate and an old Harvard schoolmate introduced me. They gave me a loving cup and it did not seem inappropriate, so that I went away thinking not so much of a separate striving group as of a body of good friends with scant color line.\nThen, as I have said, the wonderful Western pilgrimage was crowned at Seattle. The magic city of 300,000 lies on its hills above silvery waters, dream-beautiful and all but uncanny in its unexpectedness. The group of men who welcomed me were unusual in vigor and individuality. There was the lawyer who thoughtfully engineered it all; the young doctor with his cheery face; the droll politician with his reminiscences and strong opinions; the merchant from up country and his little daughter whose beautiful face of the long years ago I remembered suddenly amid the cheer of her perfect little home. There was the caterer, and the minister — it was a fine group. I have seldom seen its equal.\nFor one day I turned my back on the perfect memory of this golden journey and sailed out across the seas and thanked God for this the kindliest race on His green earth, for whom I had the privilege of working and to whom I had the pride of belonging."

    "text": "There is no doubt that the condition of affairs at the Colored Orphan Asylum of New York City is not what it should be. One may pass over the charges of incompetency and favoritism on the part of the superintendent, of rank color prejudice in the teaching ranks and cruelty to the children. These matters may be exaggerated, and certainly only searching investigation can establish their truth.\nOne thing, however, is certain beyond all reasonable doubt: this institution is not well run, the children and their guardians are not happy, the teaching force certainly lacks efficiency and the governing board seems helpless.\nThis is too bad. The Colored Orphan Asylum is an historic institution. It was founded before the war, burned in the draft riots, well endowed by unselfish friends of the race, white and black, and is beautifully housed on the banks of the Hudson. It has everything needed by an institution — land, houses, income, hundreds of children, and yet it is not a successful institution. Why? The answer is not far to seek — the white teachers do not as a rule love or sympathize with their poor little black charges; the colored teachers are not as a rule the best that could be procured.\nThis is in a sense natural or at least explicable: the white teachers are selected from the ordinary social workers of the day. They come to the work not prejudiced exactly, but with the general attitude of the white world toward the black. They shrink from colored folk; they feel a strangeness and aloofness; their social code leads them to ask that they neither eat nor sleep with their charges nor have any considerable personal contact. This demand, being exactly what the general public approves of, is easily granted, and thus the opportunities of personal contact and real acquaintanceship are reduced to the lowest notch. The children, preternaturally quick to sense the color bar afar, see this attitude; they become stubborn and resentful. This but widens the breach, for the white teachers are scarcely conscious of their unsympathetic attitude, since their action has the sanction of the whole white world.\nOn the other hand, in choosing colored teachers the board of control and the superintendent sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously, demand utterly inconsistent qualifications in colored candidates; they want educated persons of good, general training and perfect technique, but they want this coupled with humility, submissiveness and a willingness to keep in what white folk consider a Negro’s place. In other words, they openly or tacitly ask that the educated and competent Negro accept the very caste system which his training and ambition justly lead him to rebel against. To be sure, it is true that the educated black man is apt to be supersensitive and oversuspicious, but surely this is less of a fault than incompetency and far less of a hindrance than color prejudice in a colored institution.\nWhen an institution demands education, ability and submissiveness it gets submissiveness. It gets the kind of Negro who smiles and cringes and does his work in a slipshod manner. He is then charged with incompetency and put to menial tasks as the helper of some white person in authority. This is exactly what has happened at Riverdale and at a dozen similar institutions. Competent colored men and women who were self-assertive and demanded wages, treatment and promotion have been dismissed as impudent and insubordinate. White workers have been brought in for the same work, with less duties and higher wages, and allowed to indulge their racial consciousness to such an extent us almost to ruin the morale of the institution.\nWhat is the remedy! There are two paths. One is that of the Lincoln Home and Hospital in New York, which will employ no Negro in any but a menial position, although it is an endowed school and charity especially for Negroes. No colored physician can practice on the colored patients of the hospitals; no colored pharmacist may work there; even the chaplain is white; in short, the color line is drawn relentlessly and shamelessly. This is a solution, but it is a thoroughly contemptible one.\nThe other path is to require of all workers, white or black, education and thorough competency for their tasks; then the white workers should understand that persons in colored institutions must work and associate with colored folk on terms of perfect equality and mutual respect; that these children are their little brothers and sisters, and if such relationship is repugnant to them their services are undesirable. The colored workers should be warned that competency, not color, is the passport to salary, promotion and authority, and that a spirit of good will without hypersensitiveness is the thing most needful.\nIs such a solution Utopian? It is not. It is plain common sense, and if the board of control of the Colored Orphan Asylum cannot carry it out they would better give place to others.\nFinally, it is a great mistake to have a governing board over an institution for colored people on which the Negro race is not represented. There is no argument of social compatibility, wealth or education which should for a moment defend such an anomaly and injustice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nReconstruction (1919)\nThe Old Story (1911)\nCollege Education (1914)\nThe True Brownies (1919)\nEducation (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “Orphans.” The Crisis 6 (4):\n184--186. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/06/04/orphans.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Sir: On the occasion of your inauguration as President of the United States, The Crisis took the liberty of addressing to you an open letter. The Crisis spoke for no inconsiderable part of ten millions of human beings, American born, American citizens. The Crisis said in that letter, among other things:\n\nThe only time when the Negro problem is insoluble is when men insist on settling wrong by asking absolutely contradictory things. You cannot make 10,000,000 people at one and the same time servile and dignified, docile and self-reliant, servants and independent leaders, segregated and yet part of the industrial organism, disfranchised and citizens of a democracy, ignorant and intelligent. This is impossible and the impossibility is not factitious; it is in the very nature of things.\n\nOn the other hand, a determination on the part of intelligent and decent Americans to see that no man is denied a reasonable chance for life, liberty and happiness simply because of the color of his skin is a simple, sane and practical solution of the race problem in this land.\n\nSir, you have now been President of the United States for six months and what is the result? It is no exaggeration to say that every enemy of the Negro race is greatly encouraged; that every man who dreams of making the Negro race a group of menials and pariahs is alert and hopeful. Vardaman, Tillman, Hoke Smith, Cole Blease and Burleson are evidently assuming that their theory of the place and destiny of the Negro race is the theory of your administration. They and others are assuming this because not a single act and not a single word of yours since election has given anyone reason to infer that you have the slightest interest in the colored people or desire to alleviate their intolerable position. A dozen worthy Negro officials have been removed from office, and you have nominated but one black man for office, and he, such a contemptible cur, that his very nomination was an insult to every Negro in the land.\nTo this negative appearance of indifference has been added positive action on the part of your advisers, with or without your knowledge, which constitutes the gravest attack on the liberties of our people since emancipation. Public segregation of civil servants in government employ, necessarily involving personal insult and humiliation, has for the first time in history been made the policy of the United States government.\nIn the Treasury and Postoffice Departments colored clerks have been herded to themselves as though they were not human beings. We are told that one colored clerk who could not actually be segregated on account of the nature of his work has consequently had a cage built around him to separate him from his white companions of many years. Mr. Wilson, do you know these things? Are you responsible for them? Did you advise them? Do you not know that no other group of American citizens has ever been treated in this way and that no President of the United States ever dared to propose such treatment? Here is a plain, flat, disgraceful spitting in the face of people whose darkened countenances are already dark with the slime of insult. Do you consent to this, President Wilson? Do you believe in it? Have you been able to persuade yourself that national insult is best for a people struggling into self-respect?\nPresident Wilson, we do not, we cannot believe this. The Crisis still clings to the conviction that a vote for Woodrow Wilson was NOT a vote for Cole Blease or Hoke Smith. But whether it was or not segregation is going to be resented as it ought to be resented by the colored people. We would not be men if we did not resent it. The policy adopted, whether with your consent or knowledge or not, is an indefensible attack on a people who have in the past been shamefully humiliated. There are foolish people who think that such policy has no limit and that lynching, “Jim Crowism,” segregation and insult are to be permanent institutions in America.\nWe have appealed in the past, Mr. Wilson, to you as a man and statesman; to your sense of fairness and broad cosmopolitan outlook on the world. We renew this appeal and to it we venture to add some plain considerations of political expediency.\nWe black men still vote. In spite of the fact that the triumph of your party last fall was possible only because Southern white men have, through our disfranchisement, from twice to seven times the political power of Northern white men—notwithstanding this, we black men of the North have a growing nest egg of 500,000 ballots, and ballots that are counted, which no sane party can ignore. Does your Mr. Burleson expect the Democratic party to carry New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, by 200,000 votes? If he does will it not be well for him to remember that there are 237,942 black voters in these States. We have been trying to tell these voters that the Democratic party wants their votes. Have we been wrong, Mr. Wilson? Have we assumed too great and quick a growth of intelligence in the party that once made slavery its cornerstone?\nIn view of all this, we beg to ask the President of the United States and the leader of the Democratic party a few plain questions:\n\nDo you want Negro votes?\nDo you think that a “Jim Crow” civil service will get these votes?\nIs your Negro policy to be dictated by Tillman and Vardaman?\nAre you going to appoint black men to office on the same terms that you choose white men?\n\nThis is information, Mr. Wilson, which we are very anxious to have.\nThe Crisis advocated sincerely and strongly your election to the Presidency. The Crisis has no desire to be compelled to apologize to its constituency for this course. But at the present rate it looks as though some apology or explanation was going to be in order very soon.\nWe are still hoping that present indications are deceptive. We are still trying to believe that the President of the United States is the President of 10,000,000, as well as of 90,000,000, and that though the 10,000,000 are black and poor, he is too honest and cultured a gentleman to yield to the clamors of ignorance and prejudice and hatred. We are still hoping all this, Mr. Wilson, but hope deferred maketh the heart sick. Very respectfully yours,\nThe Crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWilliam Monroe Trotter (1914)\nAn Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson (1913)\nLetters (1919)\nAn Open Letter to Robert Russa Moton (1916)\nThe President (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “Another Open Letter to Woodrow\nWilson.” The Crisis 6 (7): 339–41. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/06/05/open_letter.html."

For instance, it is said this group of people are inferior to my group. Therefore, they are not entitled to the same privileges. But suppose they demand rights beyond their desert; then refuse them; if they keep demanding, silence them by law; if legal means do not keep them in their place, mob law is justifiable.\nThus the doctrine of race inferiority runs down to murder. Let us trace it in this country since the war. Negroes, being inferior, ought not to vote, said the reconstruction protesters. The nation, therefore, consented to their disfranchisement with the distinct understanding that all their other rights and privileges were to be preserved.\nBut if a man is not fit to vote why educate him and make him discontented? Consequently there was a movement against education which was so successful that to-day there are 2,000,000 Negroes not even enrolled, and practically half the Negro children in the land are not being decently trained in elementary schooling.\nTrue, but one will give them good industrial training, make them skilled workmen, so that they can save their money and buy property. No, answers the white workman, they will compete with me and lower my wages. No, cries the white home owner, I don’t want Negroes in my block.\nVery well, says the compromiser, segregate Negroes in a Ghetto. But, answers the Negro, the Ghetto is in the worst part of the city, is unhealthy, ill-cared for, filled with prostitutes whom you segregate with us, and we can’t better our condition because we cannot vote.\nWhat then is the next step? Are we not harking right back to slavery? Is there any logical resting place on this downward path between a theory of inferiority and a theory of mob violence and extinction?\nNo. The man who begins by saying “This man is not entitled to equal rights with me,” ends by either himself saying or letting others say “Lynch the Nigger.”\nThe new step which attacks the property of Negroes comes at this time because of the advance of the Negro in economic lines. Let us note this advance in a single State like Virginia with 670,000 Negro inhabitants. The Negroes cultivate 48,114 farms and the value of the farms which they own and rent increased from $24,529,016 in 1900 to $54,748,907 in 1910, or 123 per cent. Or if we would have figures covering simply ownership we find that\nIn 1891 Negroes owned $12,089,965 In 1900 Negroes owned 15,856,570 In 1911 Negroes owned 32,944,336\nThis astounding advance of over 100 per cent. in property holding in a decade is the real reason for the attack on Negro property rights in Virginia, where three cities have tried to erect Negro Ghettos.\nWhat lies beyond if the nation allows this last attack to succeed?\n\n“The ray of hope for justice to the Negro in the South is like the shadow of the dawn. We have caught such glimpses of it as to indicate to us that the morning of our future has not yet appeared.”\n– Harrisburg, Pa., Advocate Verdict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCrime (1920)\nA Statement (1919)\nHeroes (1919)\nN.A.A.C.P.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Her soul was very beautiful, wherefore she kept it veiled in lightly laced Humility, and Fear, out of which peered anxiously ever and anon the white and blue and pale gold of her face — beautiful as daybreak or as the laughing of a child. She sat in the Hither Isles, well walled between the This and Now, upon a low and silver throne and leaned upon its armposts sadly looking upward toward the sun. Now the Hither Isles are flat and cold and swampy, with drear drab light and all manner of slimy, creeping things, and piles of dirt and clouds of flying dust and sordid scraping and feeding and noise.\nShe hated them; and ever as her hands and busy feet swept back the dust and slime, her soul sat silent, silver throned, staring toward the great hill to westward, which shone so brilliant golden beneath the sunlight and above the sea.\nThe sea moaned and with it moaned the Princess’ soul, for she was lonely; very, very lonely, and full weary of the monotone of life. So she was glad to see a moving in Yonder Kingdom on the mountain side where the sun shone warm, and when the King of Yonder Kingdom, silken in robe and golden crowned, warded by his hound, walked down along the restless waters and sat beside the armpost of her throne, she wondered why she could not love him and fly with him up the shining mountain’s side out of the dirt and dust that nested between This and Now. She looked at him and tried to be glad, for he was bonny and good to look upon, this King of Yonder Kingdom: tall and straight, thin lipped and white and tawny. So again this last day she strove to burn life into his singularly sodden clay — to put his icy soul aflame wherewith to warm her own, to set his senses singing. Vacantly he heard her winged words, staring and curling his long mustaches with vast thoughtfulness. Then he said:\n“We’ve found more gold in Yonder Kingdom.”\n“Hell seize your gold!” blurted the Princess.\n“No — it’s mine,” he maintained stolidly.\nShe raised her eyes. “It belongs,” she said, “to the Empire of the Sun.”\n“Nay — the sun belongs to us,” said the King calmly, as he glanced to where Yonder Kingdom blushed above the sea. She glanced, too, and a softness crept into her eyes.\n“No, no,” she murmured, as with hesitating pause she raised her eyes above the sea, above the hill, up into the sky where the sun hung silent, splendid. Its robes were heaven’s blue, lined and broidered in living flame, and its crown was one vast jewel glistening in glittering glorv that made, the sun’s own face a blackness — the blackness of utter light. With blinded, tear-filled eyes she peered into that formless black and burning face and sensed in its soft, sad gleam unfathomed understanding. With sudden wild abandon she stretched her arms toward it appealing, beseeching, entreating, and lo!\n“Niggers and dagoes,” said the King of Yonder Kingdom, glancing carelessly backward and lighting in his lips a carefully rolled wisp of fragrant tobacco. She looked back, too, but in halfwondering terror, for it seemed —\nA Beggar man was creeping across the swamp, shuffling through the dirt and slime. He was little and bald and black, rough clothed, sooted with dirt and bent with toil. Yet withal something she sensed about him, and it seemed —\nThe King of Yonder Kingdom lounged more comfortably beside the silver throne and let curl a tiny trail of light blue smoke.\n“I hate Beggars,” he said, “especially brown and black ones.” And he then pointed at the Beggar’s retinue and laughed — an unpleasant laugh welded of contempt and amusement. The Princess looked and shrank on her throne. He the Beggar man was — was what? But his retinue, that squalid, sordid particolored band of vacant, dull-faced filth and viciousness, was writhing over the land, and he and they seemed almost crouching underneath the scorpion lash of one tall skeleton that looked like Death, and the twisted woman whom men call Pain. Yet they all walked as One.\nThe King of Yonder Kingdom laughed, but the Princess shrank on her throne and the King seeing her took a gold piece from out his purse and tossed it carelessly to the passing throng. She watched it with fascinated eyes—how it rose and sailed and whirled and struggled in the air; then seemed to burst, and upward flew its sunlight and its sheen and downward dropped its dross. She glanced at the King, but he was lighting a match. She watched the dross wallow in the slime, but the sunlight fell on the back of the Beggar’s neck and he turned his head.\nThe Beggar, passing afar, turned his head, and the Princess straightened on her throne; he turned his head, and she shivered forward on her silver seat; he looked upon her full and slow and suddenly she saw within that formless black and burning face the same soft, sad gleam of utter understanding seen so many times before. She saw the suffering of endless years and endless love that softened it. She saw the burning passion of the sun and with it the cold unbending duty-deeds of upper air. All she had seen and dreamed of seeing in the rising, blazing sun she saw now again, and with it myriads more of human tenderness, of longing and of love. So then she knew. So then she rose as to a dream come true with solemn face and waiting eyes.\nWith her rose the King of Yonder Kingdom, almost eagerly.\n“You’ll come?” he cried. “You’ll come and see my gold?” And then in sudden generosity he added: “You’ll have a golden throne—up there, when we marry.”\nBut she, looking up and on with radiant face, answered softly: “I come.”\nSo down and up and on they mounted; the black Beggar and his cavalcade of Death and Pain, and then a space; and then a lone black hound that nosed and whimpered as he ran, and then a space; and then the King of Yonder Kingdom in his robes, and then a space; and last the Princess of the Hither Isles, with face set sunward and lovelight in her eyes.\nAnd so they marched and struggled on and up through endless years and spaces, and ever the black Beggar looked back past Death and Pain toward the maid, and ever the maid strove forward with lovelit eyes, but ever the great and silken shoulders of the King of Yonder Kingdom rose between the Princess and the sun like a cloud of storms.\nNow finally they neared unto the hillside’s topmost shoulder, and there most eagerly the King bent to the bowels of the earth and bared its golden entrails — all green and gray and rusted — while the Princess strained her pitiful eyes aloft to where the Beggar, set ’twixt Death and Pain, whirled his slim back against the glory of the setting sun and stood, sombre in his grave majesty, enhaloed and transfigured, outstretching his long arms; and, around all Heaven, glittered jewels in a cloth of gold.\nA while the Princess stood and moaned in mad amaze, then with one wilful wrench she bared the white flowers of her breast and snatching forth her own red heart held it with one hand aloft while with the other she gathered close her robe and poised herself.\nThe King of Yonder Kingdom looked upward quickly, curiously, still fingering the earth, and saw the offer of her bleeding heart.\n“It’s a Nigger,” he growled darkly; “it may not be.”\nThe woman quivered.\n“It’s a Nigger,” he repeated fiercely. “It’s neither God nor Man. but a Nigger.”\nThe Princess stepped forward.\nThe King grasped his great sword and looked north and east; he raised his long sword and looked south and west.\n“I seek the sun,” the Princess sang, and started into the west.\n“Never!” cried the King of Yonder Kingdom, “for such were blasphemy and defilement and the making of all evil.”\nSo raising his great sword he struck with all his might and more. Down hissed the blow and bit that little white heart-holding hand till it flew armless and disbodied up through the sunlit air. Down hissed the blow and clove the whimpering hound till his last shriek shook the stars. Down hissed the blow and rent the earth. It trembled, fell apart and yawned to a chasm wide as earth from Heaven, deep as hell, and empty, cold and silent.\nOn yonder distant shore blazed the mighty Empire of the Sun in warm and blissful radiance; while on this side, in shadows cold and dark, gloomed the Hither Isles and the hill that once was golden but now was green and slimy dross; all below was the sad and moaning sea, while between the Here and There flew the severed hand and dripped the bleeding heart.\nThen up from the soul of the Princess welled a cry of dark Despair — such cry as only babe-raped mothers know, and murdered loves. Poised on the crumbling edge of that great nothingness the Princess hung, hungering with her eyes and straining her fainting ears against the awful splendor of the sky.\nOut from the slime and shadows groped the King, thundering; “Back — don’t be a fool!”\nBut down through the thin ether thrilled the still and throbbing warmth of heaven’s sun whispering “Leap!”\nAnd the Princess leapt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nIn God’s Gardens (1912)\nThe Quadroon (1911)\nThe Burden of Black Women (1914)\nThe Gospel According to Mary Brown (1919)\nA Mild Suggestion (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1913. “The Princess of the Hither Isles.”\nThe Crisis 6 (6): 285–89. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/06/06/princess_of_hither_isles.html."

    "text": "With twelve million Negroes in America and at least ten millions in the adjacent West Indies, is the black race economically helpless? These two groups as consumers must at the very lowest estimate spend ten billion dollars a year. Perhaps the larger part of this expenditure is compulsory, and we have small choice as to where and how it should be spent. But there must be hundreds of millions where we do have choice in the direction of its expenditure. This expenditure can and must, if we survive in America, be so directed as to employ our own muscle and brains in the production of the goods and services which we need. Such production demands skill, but what skill, and how shall we gain this skill?\nThe way is clear. Our colleges are or may be centers of information and learning. They should study the facts concerning the consumption of goods by American Negroes and West Indians. They should measure and make clear our economic demands. We have industrial schools. Those industrial schools should train young people, so that they would have skill to do the kind of work which is necessary to satisfy our demands. Their aims should not be simply to do the work and make the goods which white folks demand. Their aim should not be simply to train for decadent and outworn trades where there is a lessening demand for workers. Their main object should be to train Negroes to supply Negroes’ needs.\nWhen we know just what our demand for goods and services is and when we have people trained in modern technique to furnish these things, we in turn can furnish the capital. That capital is simply a part of the money which we spend. We furnish such capital today to the white industrial world. There is no reason on earth why it should not be spent to establish a black industrial world.\nThere are wise and careful students who claim that no such racial economy is possible. I take no stock in their pessimism. It not only is possible but it is already beginning and it only needs scientific guidance and technical skill to make it spread. What has been done by separate nations, protected by tariffs, can be done by separate groups, protected by a vast sense of desperate need.\nWhen these goods are made, they can be distributed by Negro business, built up like the C.M.A. stores. Such stores will meet increasing competition from white stores, and they are at the mercy of the owners of white capital. Nevertheless, they can meet this competition, and they can substitute colored capital for white capital, if they will start upon one path and that path demands the abolition absolutely of private profit: the willingness of young Negro managers of brains and skill to work for low, definite wage, instead of trying to emulate the whites’ desire for millions. We must embrace the ideal of poverty—not poverty that calls for dirt, disease and pain, but poverty that definitely and decisively puts aside the ideal of luxury, waste and inordinate wealth. To the ideal of poverty, we must add that of service, dedicated to the rescue of twenty-two millions of human beings who are bound to us by blood and tradition. Here is an economic program for times of depression, and it will work, if we work it.\nTo Your Tents, Oh Israel!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPhilanthropy and Self Help (1918)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\nEducation (1930)\nOur Economic Future (1928)\nEmployment (1932)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1932. “To Your Tents, Oh Israel!”\nThe Crisis 39 (3): 93–94. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/39/03/to_your_tents.html."

    "text": "The assault on a white woman in Hawaii brings this whole volcanic structure to the world’s notice. Hawaii is a volcano and a series of volcanoes in more senses of the word than one. It is near the exact center of the Pacific Ocean. It was settled in prehistoric times by dark Mongolians with many evidences of a strong Negro strain. It was discovered by Captain James Cook in 1778. A company of missionaries landed there in 1820 and in 1823 came the great revival when the Queen and one-fifth of the population were converted to Christianity.\nTroubles with foreigners ensued, culminating in a revolution in 1893, which deposed the native Queen and made a missionary’s son President. Hawaii was annexed to the United States in 1898. But the real conquest of Hawaii was the investment there of millions of dollars to raise pineapples, sugar, coffee, bananas, and other merchandise. Nearly eight hundred thousand tons of sugar are annually exported and two hundred and thirteen million cans of pineapples. To raise this produce, the exploiters of Hawaii encouraged an immigration which has resulted in the most astonishing mixture of races known to the modern world.\nWhen the missionaries arrived, there were 142,000 Hawaiians. Christianity reduced them to only 57,000 in 1872. Large numbers of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, together with many Philippinos, Porto Ricans and Portuguese, were brought into the country to work the plantations. Today, there are 255,ooo inhabitants, of whom half are of Japanese and Chinese descent, 8% Philippinos, 18% Hawaiians or part Hawaiian, and 21% Caucasians.\nHere in itself is a problem, because the new generation of Japanese, Chinese and Philippino-Hawaiians, are American citizens and voters, having been born in the Islands. We must add to this the fact that Hawaii is a naval base and has usually over fifteen thousand United States soldiers and sailors in the forts. And finally, there land in Hawaii each year 17,500 tourists to loll and play and spend.\nHeretofore, there has been little racial antagonism. Inter-marriage among all the races, even the few Negroes, has gone on. But the great fact and menace remains. Big business owns Hawaii, and its five main groups are the real Kings. They control the land and they own investments totalling over $300,000,000. They are there to make money. They are backed by the military power of the United States, and the threat of racial antagonism between white and colored, is thus ever in the air.\nWe must watch Hawaii, and in the present turmoil, remember two significant facts: First, laws against rape are not severe in Hawaii because they were originally framed to make the seduction of native girls easy by white men. Not long ago, an appeal was broadcast in American papers to support the thousands of illegitimate children there left helpless by white soldiers and marines. Secondly, a society lady and her accomplices, who killed a. Hawaiian in cold blood, are today free on nominal bail, and in all probability will never be punished.\nWatch Hawaii.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Rise of the West Indian (1920)\nAn Amazing Island (1915)\nI Go A-Talking (1913)\nWestward Ho (1934)\nWest Indian Immigration (1924)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1932. “Hawaii.” The Crisis 39 (3):\n93. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/39/03/hawaii.html."

    "text": "There have been this year thirteen or more persons lynched. I say thirteen “or more.” It may have been fifteen or eighteen, but I am taking the reports of Tuskegee, which are usually just below the truth. This means that once a month in the United States mobs have seized prisoners, who in every case but one were black, and have murdered them without any attempt to find out whether they were guilty or not.\nWhen this was said in other years, it was always assumed, despite our vehement protest, that these victims were guilty and that they had raped white women. But we have this year the astonishing findings of the “Southern Commission on the Study of Lynching” issued under the title “Lynchings and What They Mean.” This committee of thirteen had a white chairman and seven other Southern white men as members, and five Negroes.\nThe report confirms everything that has been said against lynching by supporters of law and decency during the last twenty-five years. Namely:\nOnly one in every six of the persons lynched had been even accused of rape; and naturally, not all of those accused were guilty.\nThat white men have disguised themselves to impersonate Negroes and fasten crime upon them.\nThat few lynchers have been punished or even indicted.\nThat of the Negroes lynched, for instance, in 1930, two were innocent, not even being accused of crime; and in eleven other cases, there was grave doubt of their guilt. In the remaining five cases, while there were crimes committed, there is considerable doubt as to whether the guilty men were caught.\nThat in numbers of cases the members of the mob were unmasked and perfectly well-known.\nThat women and children were often in the mobs.\nThat the causes of lynching as well as of Negro crime lie in the terrible forcing of ignorance on the colored people of the South and in caste restrictions.\nThe report bravely concludes:\n\nLynching can and will be eliminated in proportion as all elements of the population are provided opportunities for development and are accorded fundamental human rights. Whether in the field of religion, education, economics, jurisprudence, or politics, anything which looks toward this end is a factor in reducing mob violence. For, fundamentally, lynching is an expression of a basic lack of respect both for human beings and for organized society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Lynching Industry (1915)\nLynching (1927)\nCauses of Lynching (1931)\nLynching (1914)\nAnti-Lynching Legislation (1922)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1932. “Lynchings.” The Crisis 39\n(2): 58. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/39/02/lynchings.html."

    "text": "If someone should give you a million dollars to spend in the settlement of the Negro problem over a period of twenty years, how would you spend it?\nOne piquant answer to this question is furnished by the Twenty Year Report of the Phelps stokes Fund, showing its activities from 1911 to 1931. During that time, the Fund has disbursed $1,244,447.55. If we subtract from this the expenses of administration and certain sums spent exclusively for white folk and American Indians, we have a net sum of $929,010 spent for Negroes.\nThe exact figures, omitting the cents, and with some re-classification of items from the published report, are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Funds Expended\n\n\n$1,244,447\n\n\nSubtract from these:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministration Expense\n$107,628\n\n\n\n\nHousing for Whites\n$195,059\n\n\n\n\nFor Indians\n$12,750\n\n$315,437\n\n\n\n\n\n$929,010\n\n\nNet Expenditure for Negroes:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

Liberia\n\n$20,993\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$925,246\n\n\n\nNearly 40% of the money has been spent for ascertaining the facts concerning the Negro, and especially his educational status. This has involved the setting up of an educational office with experts at an expense of $200,000, through which surveys were made costing nearly $50,000 in the United States, and over $120,000 in Africa.\nOf the value of the facts brought together in these surveys there can be no doubt. On the other hand The Crisis has had frequent occasion to disagree with conclusions drawn from these facts.\nThe expenditure for Negro schools has taken nearly $250,000.—a modest sum, when one considers the needs of Negro education. Of this amount, half has gone to Hampton and Tuskegee, the Penn School, and schools of that type. Recognized colleges, like Howard, Fisk and Tuskegee have received only $42,000. The rest has gone in small amounts to small schools. The education of Negroes of Africa has been directly helped only by $18,000 worth of scholarships and about $7,000 in grants. The rest of the money has gone mainly to white people working more or less directly for the education of Africans or of white public opinion.\nRace relations has loomed large in the Phelps Stokes program, involving $41,000 worth of scholarships and endowment for white folks in America to induce them to study the Negro problem and $97,000 for general work in race relations. In Africa, most of this money has gone to white experts, who have been persuaded to visit America and make comparisons between the Negro here and in Africa. For this they have been paid $23,450 in honoraria alone. Beside this, $21,000 has gone to Liberia, chiefly for education, and $75,000 for Y. M. C. A. dormitory facilities in New York City. Several valuable conferences have been promoted and helped-$10,000 for the Le Zoute Conference of 1926; $3,000 for the Jerusalem Conference and $14,000 for conferences on native education.\nWithout doubt we have here the record of effort and the expenditure of a public trust for great human objects which has accomplished much for the Negro race, and which deserves our thanks and appreciation. At the same time, it would be unfair if we did not express your candid criticism. First of all, we think that the relative proportion of expenditures might have been improved. We believe that at least half the fund should have gone for Negro education and for gifts and scholarships, rather than so largely for educational surveys. Especially are scholarships and fellowships needed for Negro students in the United States and Africa, and we wish instead of $25,000, $100,000 had been spent in this line.\nThe expenditure of $200,000 for race relations seems to us also excessive, especially as it has been spent very largely for the education of white people and only partially for developing black folk. We are sure that such education is needed, but the training of white folk in racial attitudes is most effective if it arises from a real desire for knowledge rather than the artificial encouragement of a gift. If Southern white colleges do not see the necessity of studying the American Negro, is it really effective to endow such study? Can white South Africans learn as much about the American race problem on a well-remunerated trip here, rather than on visits which South Africa itself sees the necessity of financing? And finally, in all work for race relations, should not opportunity be made for the development and discovery of the best among Negroes, rather than for encouraging whites to think that Negro advancement is entirely dependent upon them.\nWe admit that in all these matters there is room for argument and that specific cases always alter general principles; and that after all the proof of this past effort lies largely in future results.\nWe particularly dissent from the thesis which the Phelps Stokes Fund and others have repeatedly put forth: Namely, that education based on the Hampton-Tuskegee idea has been the real cause of the success of Negro education in the United States. We firmly believe that the contrary is true and that with all that Hampton and Tuskegee have done, and they have done much, nevertheless their peculiar program of industrial education has not been successful and has been given up, while the essential soundness of the Atlanta, Fisk and Howard program of general and higher education and teacher training has with all its omissions proved the salvation of the Negro race.\nNotwithstanding this criticism, we thank the Phelps Stokes Fund for its work, and we venture to believe that the greatest accomplishment of the trustees of the Fund has been the education which they and their friends have received by which they have gradually advanced from a point of view which looked for the salvation of the Negro race chiefly in intelligent white philanthropic leadership, to a height where they recognized that Negro leadership is indispensable for the uplift of the Negro race and that race relations are only of real value as they bring together equals to strive for mutual advancement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nInvestments (1921)\nNegro Education (1918)\nEducation (1930)\nWoofterism (1931)\nPhilanthropy and Self Help (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1932. “If I Had a Million Dollars: A Review of the\nPhelps Stokes Fund.” The Crisis 39 (11): 347. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/39/11/million_dollars.html."

    "text": "Our educational problem has two difficulties: first, the great mass of Negroes are not receiving proper and adequate common school training. It means today that we are educating an aristocracy of learning, but we are not using it or allowing it to be used to educate the masses of the people.\nIn the Northern States, where two million Negroes live, it is difficult for the best trained Negroes to find employment in the public schools unless the Negro community accepts separate and segregated school systems which are usually more poorly equipped and more inefficiently conducted than the white schools, not to mention the grave surrender of principle. In the South, the well-trained Negro teacher has to contend with poorly supported separate schools at low wages, together with a personal treatment that often saps manhood and independent thinking. Thus, a great field of employment into which masses of Negro college men and women with one or more years of technical training could easily be absorbed, actually invites now only a few thousand.\nThis increases the problem of earning a living for the average college-bred Negro. If he can take a course in professional study, there is a chance for him as physician, dentist, lawyer, pharmacist and engineer. But these fields are limited by the poverty of the Negro masses. These masses are still largely excluded from all but the lower positions in the general technique of industry.\nThe average Negro college graduate, therefore, is not a man prepared to enter into a paying field of employment. He is simply one who, by his general intelligence, and by his knowledge of modern civilization, is in a better position than most people, resolutely to attack his economic and social problem. He has opportunity to become the trained fighting wedge to advance the place of black folk in modern civilization by using his brains so as to force himself to a position where he can work and achieve and make a place for the millions of his fellows who straggle on behind.\nThe question is, however, how far is the college which the Negro attends, black and white, arranging its program so as to train men for this kind of work? It must be confessed that the outlook here is poor. The white colleges are not doing it for white men, much less for their Negro students. And the colored colleges, for the most part, continue slavishly to pattern their curricula after the white colleges. So far as they are compelled to do this in order to maintain their academic standing, they have some excuse; but the chance of varying and enlarging their programs has been greatly increased in the last few years. Above all, the opportunity for inculcating spiritual freedom, broad vision, independence of thought and willingness to sacrifice, is as large as it is untouched. We Negroes have got the material for higher training. We have got the will to send it to college and are finding by infinite pains the funds to support it. But we have not yet got the spirit and vision to train it aright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEducation (1911)\nThe Negro Public School (1916)\nNegro Education (1918)\nEducation (1930)\nSegregation (1910)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1932. “Employment.” The Crisis 39\n(9): 299. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/39/09/employment.html."

    "text": "The semi-secret and persistent propaganda on the history and meaning of the Civil War still keeps up to an astonishing degree. No book or article can get even a respectful hearing among the leading reviewers of the nation unless it subscribes fully to this thesis: 1. The cause of the Civil War was not slavery. 2. The South would have emancipated the Negroes of its own accord. 3. There was no cruelty or essential degradation in the slave system. 4. The enfranchisement of Negroes was a mistake. 5. The evils of Reconstruction were mainly the result of emancipating slaves and making them citizens and voters. 6. The Negro officials of the South were venal and ignorant and Negro rule had to be put down by force and fraud. 7. The radicals of the North were inspired by spiteful hatred and sought to punish and humiliate the white South. 8. The white Southerners received their defeat in good faith, bore no animosity toward the North, and were disposed to treat the Negroes with fairness and even kindness.\nThis thesis was begun by Dunning of Columbia, carried out in a series of monographs by young students at Columbia and Johns Hopkins University, sanctified by James Ford Rhodes, and lately has received new life and extraordinary emphasis in such books as “The Tragic Era,” by Claude Bowers, “Carl Schurz,” by Fuess “The Rise of American Civilization,” by Charles and Mary Beard, Milton’s “Age of Hate,” Carpenter’s “The South as a Conscious Minority,” and numbers of others widely advertised and highly praised volumes. On the other hand, books that dare differ in any way with this thesis are killed by silence or denunciation. Frederick Bancroft’s “Slave Trading in the Old South,” Stewart’s “Reward of Patriotism,” Skagg’s “The Southern Oligarchy,” and last and first, Charles Edward Russell’s “Blaine of Maine,” are books that dare to take the Opposite stand and have been railed at or ignored.\nCharles Edward Russell’s “Blaine of Maine” is a splendid biography and would have been universally hailed as such if Mr. Russell had acquiesced in the philosophy of the Southerners. But imagine a book written today affirming Andrew Johnson when he took his oath as Vice President of the United States was so drunk that he could not repeat the sentences that Hamlin read! When he was President, “Delegations of colored men came to see him with appeals in behalf of their people, now faced with an economic crisis in the South. He contented himself with vague and rambling expressions of a general good will but nothing to show what he intended to do for them. He had always been their friend; all his career had shown that, he reminded them. Beyond this, nothing. Frederick Douglass was one of the speakers for one of these delegations and made an eloquent and logical plea. It was no more productive than the others had been.”\nOr take this uncontrovertible statement of the problem of Reconstruction:\n\nWho were to be voters at these elections in lately revolted states? The same classes of persons that had voted before the war? What was to be done about men of the South that had stood by the Union, that had been driven from their homes and were now returning there? Nothing. What was to be done about the four million emancipated Negroes? Nothing. Let all these shift for themselves. The main thing was apparently to get into Congress representatives from these states and restore there the pre-war status.\n\nFor what followed, blame has been laid heavily upon both sides, according to the prejudices, antecedents or ancestry of the writer. As a matter of fact, the results were probably inevitable. The most liberal minds in the North could hardly be expected to accept such a doctrine after the struggles and sacrifices of such a war. The men of the South, released from all danger of punishment and suddenly elevated to their old station in the government, could hardly be blamed for the conclusions they formed. In the war the decision had gone against them. They were now in effect assured by the President that they had done no wrong in waging that war. If they had done no wrong they must have been right. If the war was right the slavery for which alone they made the war must have been right also. And slavery being right as well as advantageous for many reasons, they proceeded to reenact it throughout the South.\n\nThis is the kind of book that Russell has written. It is not a volume of hero worship. He puts before us the picture of a man of rare ability, with many foibles, riding triumphantly on the current of his times. Russell refuses to falsify the facts. He declares that the convention elections which reconstructed the South were in every state “fair and honest elections.” And that the corruption of the South after the war was not the corruption of black people or of white people, but the corruption of America, and the corruption which engulfed and ruined James T. Blaine.\nThis is a big book of nearly 450 pages, but for those who want to escape from the morass of propaganda which has been deliberately trying for fifty years to lie about slavery and the Civil War, it is the kind of book to be bought and read and handed along.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAn Open Letter (1915)\nEmancipation (1913)\nRadicals (1919)\nLoyalty (1917)\nSocial Equality (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1932. “Blaine of Maine.”\nThe Crisis 39 (8): 267. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/39/08/blaine_of_maine.html."

    "text": "I most emphatically think that the Negro has a better chance in Liberia than any where else in Africa. I haven’t been everywhere, but the Gold Coast is supposed to be the very best colony in all Africa. I was seven weeks there. Let me tell you one incident. I was walking down the street by the market in Accra. The sidewalk was so crowded that the people were also filling the street. Most of them women and children. I did not see the first part of this incident but what must have happened was this: An Englishman in a car turned the corner very rapidly. A young Negro, well-dressed, very wellbred looking must have called out to the Englishman to be careful on account of the women and children in the street. He couldn’t have called loudly or rudely or I should have heard. I was only a few steps away but looking in another direction. What I saw and heard was this: The Englishman stopped his car at the curb, jumped out upon the sidewalk and slapped the young man in the face and shouted (I heard him very easily!) “How dare you call out to me like that? Don’t I know more about running a car than you. I’ll have you arrested if you dare to call out to a European.” The young man said absolutely nothing. Then turning, the Englishman saw me (I seemed to be the only European in sight), and said: “This is outrageous. Such insolence!” And I said: “You are showing them such a good example of self control, aren’t you?” He turned redder and said: “It’s you missionaries who ruin them.” I didn’t argue with him and tell him I wasn’t a missionary. What was the use! He walked to his car and as he got in he turned to the perfectly silent crowd and said: “If any of you dare to shout at a European, I’ll have you arrested! And not one native made any protest. They evidently knew it would be perfectly useless.\nContrast this with the story Mr. Buell tells about a Firestone man slapping a Liberian native.\nThe Liberian Government is not blameless, but its worst sins are shared by the would be reformers. If they forced men to go to Fernando Po and Libreville, the partners in the forcing were the owners of the European ships and the Spanish and French concessionaires or governments. The brutalities of the Frontier Force are brutalities practiced by soldiers everywhere—Americans in the Philippines, the English in Ireland, and the French, everywhere. The Liberian Government didn’t have this standing army until the English and French forced them to. And as for taking lands and forced labor at home—where have there been in Liberia such forced labor as in the French Congo, such spoilation of land as in South Africa and Kenya?\nI believe the graft the most serious blot, but as in Latin America, is it those who buy and benefit or those who are bought and are tempted who are most to blame? Mr. King was no worse than those presidents kept in Cuba, in Peru, and in Venezuela by American capital and the American Department of State owned by capital. The trouble with Liberia is that Liberia is objecting to the boa-constrictor—a proper hare should enjoy being swallowed.\nI hope and pray that the Liberian Government will see that these taxes for their salaries are as wicked as the National City Bank and Firestone extortions. But we, of the country of the National City Bank and Firestone, have no right to throw stones. And as for law and order, you know one is safer in Liberia than in New York. Ask poor Lindbergh.\nI know that Liberia is not able to spend so much on education as the British colonies, or the West Coast spends on the education of the Africans, but knowing how to read is not everything. Some Englishmen twitted Madariaga about Spain’s wishing to have a permanent seat in the council, saying: “Why, the large majority of Spaniards are illiterate!” Madariaga retorted: “Does it show greater lack of intelligence not to be able to read—or to be able to read The Daily Mail?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nClothes (1920)\nSouthern Papers (1911)\nBlessed Discrimination (1913)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nMemphis or East St. Louis?

    "text": "That we continually face in this problem of race segregation in the United States is a paradox like this:\n\nCompulsory separation of human beings by essentially artificial criteria, such as birth, nationality, language, color and race, is the cause of human hate, jealousy and war, and the destruction of talent and art.\n\nWhere separation of mankind into races, groups and classes is compulsory, either by law or custom, and whether that compulsion be temporary or permanent, the only effective defense that the segregated and despised group has against complete spiritual and physical disaster, is internal self-organization for self-respect and self-defense.\n\nThe dilemma is complete and there is no escape. The black man born in South Carolina has a right and a duty to complain that any public school system separated by artificial race and class lines is needlessly expensive, socially dangerous, and spiritually degrading. And yet that black man will send his child to a Negro school, and he will see to it, if he is really a man, that this Negro school is the best possible school; that it is decently housed and effectively taught by well-trained teachers. He will demand a voice in its control, finances and curriculum, and any action of his that asks for less than this will mark him as an idiot or a coward.\nA black man born in Boston has a right to oppose any separation of schools by color, race or class. He has a duty to insist that the public school attended by all kinds and conditions of people, is the best and only door to true democracy and human understanding. But this black man in Boston has no right, after he has made this academic pronouncement to send his own helpless immature child into school where white children kick, cuff or abuse him, or where teachers openly and persistently neglect or hurt or dwarf its soul. If he does, he must not be surprised if the boy lands in the gutter or penitentiary. Moreover, our Boston brother has no right to sneer at the “Jim-Crow” schools of South Carolina, or at the brave teachers who guide them at starvation wage; nor can he conscientiously advise the South Carolinian to move to Boston and join the bread lines.\nLet the N.A.A.C.P. and every upstanding Negro pound at the closed gates of opportunity and denounce caste and segregation; but let us not punish our own children under the curious impression that we are punishing our white oppressors. Let us not affront our own self-respect by accepting a proffered equality which is not equality, or submitting to discrimination simply because it does not involve actual and open segregation; and above all, let us not sit down and do nothing for self-defense and self-organization just because we are too stupid or too distrustful of ourselves to take vigorous and decisive action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSegregation (1910)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nSegregation (1934)\nThe Strength of Segregation (1913)\n‘Social Equality’ (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1934. “Separation and Self-Respect.”\nThe Crisis 41 (3): 85. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/41/03/separation_and_selfrespect.html."

    "text": "I have with interest the various criticisms on my recent discussions of segregation. Those like that of Mr. Pierce of Cleveland, do not impress me. I am not worried about being inconsistent. What worries me is the Truth. I am talking about conditions in 1934 and not in 1910. I do not care what I said in 1910 or 1810 or in B.C. 700.\nThe arguments of Walter White, George Schuyler and Kelly Miller have logic, but they seem to me quite beside the point. In the first place, Walter White is white. He has more white companions and friends than colored. He goes where he will in New York City and naturally meets no Color Line, for the simple and sufficient reason that he isn’t “colored”; he feels his new freedom in bitter contrast to what he was born to in Georgia. This is perfectly natural and he does what anyone else of his complexion would do.\nBut it is fantastic to assume that this has anything to do with the color problem in the United States. It naturally makes Mr. White an extreme opponent of any segregation based on a myth of race. But this argument does not apply to Schuyler or Miller or me. Moreover, Mr. White knows this. He moved once into a white apartment house and it went black on him. He now lives in a colored apartment house with attendant limitations. He once took a friend to dine with him at the celebrated café of the Lafayette Hotel, where he had often been welcomed. The management humiliated him by refusing to serve Roland Hayes.\nThe attitudes of Schuyler and Kelly Miller are historically based on the amiable assumption that there is little or no segregation in the North, and that agitation and a firm stand is making this disappear; that obvious desert and accomplishment by Negroes can break down prejudice. This is a fable. I once believed it passionately. It may become true in 250 or 1,000 years. Now it is not true. No black man whatever his culture or ability is today in America regarded as a man by any considerable number of white Americans. The difference between North and South in the matter of segregation is largely a difference of degree; of wide degree certainly, but still of degree.\nIn the North, neither Schuyler nor Kelly Miller nor anyone with a visible admixture of Negro blood can frequent hotels or restaurants. They have difficulty in finding dwelling places in better class neighborhoods. They occupy “Lower 1” on Pullmans, and if they are wise, they do not go into dining cars when any large number of white people is there. Their children either go to colored schools or to schools nominally for both races, but actually attended almost exclusively by colored children. In other words, they are confined by unyielding public opinion to a Negro world. They earn a living on colored newspapers or in colored colleges, or other racial institutions. They treat colored patients and preach to colored pews. Not one of the 12 colored Ph.D.’s of last year, trained by highest American and European standards, is going to get a job in any white university. Even when Negroes in the North work side by side with whites, they are Segregated, like the postal clerks, or refused by white unions or denied merited promotion.\nNo matter how much we may fulminate about “No segregation,” there stand the flat facts. Moreover, this situation has in the last quarter century been steadily growing worse. Mr. Spingarn may ask judicially as to whether or not the N.A.A.C.P. should change its attitude toward segregation. The point that he does not realize is that segregation has changed its attitude toward the N.A.A.C.P. The higher the Negro climbs or tries to climb, the more pitiless and unyielding the color ban. Segregation may be just as evil today as it was in 1910, but it is more insistent, more prevalent and more unassailable by appeal or argument. The pressing problem is: What are we going to do about it?\nIn 1910, colored men could be entertained in the best hotels in Cleveland, Detroit and Chicago. Today, there is not a single Northern city, except New York, where a Negro can be a guest at a first-class hotel. Not even in Boston is he welcome; and in New York, the number of hotels where he can go is very small. Roland Hayes was unable to get regular hotel accommodations, and Dr. Moton only succeeds by powerful white influence and by refraining from use of the public dining room or the public lobbies.\nIf as Spingarn asserts, the N.A.A.C.P. has conducted a quarter-century campaign against segregation, the net result has been a little less than nothing. We have by legal action steadied the foundation so that in the future, segregation must be by wish and will and not law, but beyond that we have not made the slightest impress on the determination of the overwhelming mass of white Americans not to treat Negroes as men.\nThese are unpleasant facts. We do not like to voice them. The theory is that by maintaining certain fictions of law and administration, by whistling and keeping our courage up, we can stand on the “principle” of no segregation and wait until public opinion meets our position. But can we do this? When we were living in times of prosperity; when we were making post-war incomes; when our labor was in demand, we perhaps could afford to wait. But today, faced by starvation and economic upheaval, and by the question of being able to survive at all in this land in the reconstruction that is upon us, it is ridiculous not to see, and criminal not to tell, the colored people that they can not base their salvation upon the empty reiteration of a slogan.\nWhat then can we do? The only thing that we not only can, but must do, is voluntarily and insistently to organize our economic and social power, no matter how much segregation it involves. Learn to associate with ourselves and to train ourselves for effective association. Organize our strength as consumers; learn to co-operate and use machines and power as producers; train ourselves in methods of democratic control within our own group. Run and support our own institutions.\nWe are doing this partially now, only we are doing it under a peculiar attitude of protest, and with only transient and distracted interest. A number of excellent young gentlemen in Washington, having formed a Negro Alliance, proceed to read me out of the congregation of the righteous use I dare even discuss segregation. But who are these young men? The products of a segregated school system; the talent selected by Negro teachers; the persons who can today, in nine cases out of ten, earn only a living through segregated Negro social institutions. These are the men who are yelling against segregation. If most of them had been educated in the mixed schools in New York instead of the segregated schools of Washington, they never would have seen college, because Washington picks out and sends ten times as many Negroes to college as New York does.\nIt would, of course, be full easy to deny that this voluntary association for great social and economic ends is segregation; and if I had done this in the beginning of this debate, many people would have been easily deceived, and would have yelled “No segregation” with one side of their mouths and “Race pride and Race initiative” with the other side. No such distinction can possibly be drawn. Segregation may be compulsory by law or it may be compulsory by economic or social condition, or it may be a matter of free choice. At any rate, it is the separation of human beings and separation despite the will to humanity. Such separation is evil; it leads to jealousy, greed, nationalism and war; and yet it is today and in this world inevitable; inevitable to Jews because of Hitler; inevitable to Japanese because of white Europe; inevitable to Russia because of organized greed over all the white world; inevitable to Ethiopia because of white armies and navies; inevitable, because without it, the American Negro will suffer evils greater than any possible evil of separation: we would suffer the loss of self-respect, the lack of faith in ourselves, the lack of knowledge about ourselves, the lack of ability to make a decent living by our own efforts and not by philanthropy.\nThis situation has been plunged into crisis and precipitated to an open demand for thought and action by the Depression and the New Deal. The government, national and state, is helping and guiding the individual. It has entered and entered for good into the social and economic organization of life. We could wish, we could pray, that this entrance could absolutely ignore lines of race and color, but we know perfectly well it does not and will not, and with the present American opinion, it cannot. The question is then, are we going to stand out and refuse the inevitable and inescapable government aid because we first wish to abolish the Color Line? This is not simply tilting at windmills; it is, if we are not careful, committing race suicide."

    "text": "No Segregation\nBack of all slogans lies the difficulty that the meanings may change without changing the words. For instance, “no segregation” may mean two very different things:\n\nA chance for the Negro to advance without the hindrances which arise when he is segregated from the main group, and the main social institutions upon which society depends. He becomes, thus, an outsider, a hanger on, with no chance to function properly as a man.\nIt may mean utter lack of faith of Negroes in Negroes, and the desire to escape into another group, shirking, on the other hand, all responsibility for ignorance, degradation and lack of experience among Negroes, while asking admission into the other group on terms of full equality and with full chance for individual development.\n\nIt is in the first sense that I have always believed and used the slogan: “No Segregation.” On the other hand, in the second sense, I have no desire or right to hinder or estop those persons who do not want to be Negroes. But I am compelled to ask the very plain and pertinent question: Assuming for the moment that the group into which you demand admission does not want you, what are you going to do about it? Can you demand that they want you? Can you make them by law or public opinion admit you when they are supreme over this same public opinion and make these laws? Manifestly, you cannot. Manifestly your admission to the other group on the basis of your individual desert and wish, can only be accomplished if they, too, join in the wish to have you. If they do so join, all problems based mostly on race and color disappear, and there remains only the human problems of social uplift and intelligence and group action. But there is in the United States today no sign that this objection to the social and even civic recognition of persons of Negro blood is going to occur during the life of persons now living. In which case there can be only one meaning to the slogan “No Segregation;” and that is, no hindrance to my effort to be a man. If you do not wish to associate with me, I am more than willing to associate with myself. Indeed, I deem it a privilege to work with and for Negroes, only asking that my hands be not tied nor my feet hobbled."

The real object, confessed or semiconscious, is to so isolate the Negro that he will be spiritually bankrupt, physically degenrate, and economically dependent.\nAgainst this it is the bounden duty of every Negro and every enlightened American to protest; to oppose the policy so far as it is manifest by laws; to agitate against customs by revealing facts; and to appeal to the sense of decency and justice in all American citizens.\nI have never known an American Negro who did not agree that this was a proper program. Some have disagreed as to the emphasis to be put on this and that method of protest; on the efficacy of any appeal against American prejudice; but all Negroes have agreed that segregation is bad and should be opposed.\nSuppose, however, that this appeal is ineffective or nearly so? What is the Negro going to do? There is one thing that he can or must do, and that is to see to it that segregation does not undermine his health; does not leave him spiritually bankrupt; and does not make him an economic slave; and he must do this at any cost.\nIf he cannot live in sanitary and decent sections of a city, he must build his own residential quarters, and raise and keep them on a plane fit for living. If he cannot educate his children in decent schools with other children, he must, nevertheless, educate his children in decent Negro schools and arrange and conduct and oversee such schools. If he cannot enter American industry at a living wage, or find work suited to his education and talent, or receive promotion and advancement according to his desserts, he must organize his own economic life so that just as far as possible these discriminations will not reduce him to abject exploitation.\nEveryone of these movements on the part of colored people are not only necessary, but inevitable. And at the same time, they involve more or less active segregation and acquiescence in segregation.\nHere again, if there be any number of American Negroes who have not in practical life made this fight of self-segregation and self-association against the compulsory segregation forced upon them, I am unacquainted with such persons. They may, of course, explain their compulsory retreat from a great ideal, by calling segregation by some other name. They may affirm with fierce insistency that they will never, no never, under any circumstances acquiesce in segregation. But if they live in the United States in the year of our Lord 1934, or in any previous year since the foundation of the government, they are segregated; they accept segregation, and they segregate themselves, because they must. From this dilemma I see no issue."

    "text": "Boycott\nWhither does all this sudden talk of segregation lead? May I illustrate by an appositive example. Several times The Crisis has commended what seemed to us the epoch-making work of The Chicago Whip when it instituted boycotts against stores in the black belt which refused to employ Negro clerks. Recently, in Washington, a group of young intellectuals sought to do the same thing but fell afoul of the ordinances against picketing. These efforts illustrate the use of mass action by Negroes who take advantage of segregation in order to strengthen their economic foundation. The Chicago success was applauded by every Negro in the land and the Washington failure deserved success. Today the same sort of move is being made in Richmond.\nYet, mind you, both these efforts were efforts toward segregation. The movement meant, in essence, Negro clerks for Negro customers. Of course, this was not directly said but this is what it amounted to. The proponents knew that Negro clerks would only be hired if Negro customers demanded it, and if the Negro customers, as happened in some cases, did not want to be waited on by Negro clerks, or even felt insulted if the Negro clerk came to them, then the proprietors had a perfect right to refuse to employ Negro clerks. Indeed, this happened in several cases in Harlem, New York.\nAnd yet given the practically compulsory segregation of residence, and the Negro race is not only justified but compelled to invoke the additional gesture which involves segregation by asking Negro clerks for Negro customers. Of course, the logical demand of those who refuse to contemplate any measure of segregation, would be to demand the employment of Negro clerks everywhere in the city, and in all stores, at least in the same proportion that the Negro population bears to the total population. This was not demanded because such a demand would be futile and have no implement for its enforcement. But you can enforce the employment of Negroes by commercial houses in a Negro community and this ought to be done and must be done, and this use of the boycott by American Negroes must be widened and systematized, with care, of course, to avoid the ridiculous laws which make boycotts in so many cases illegal.\nThe funny postscript to all this, is that the same group of young Negroes who sought in Washington to fight segregation with segregation, or better to build a decent living on compulsory segregation, immediately set up a yell of “No Segregation,” when they read The Crisis."

    "text": "Integration\nExtreme opponents of segregation act as though there was but one solution of the race problem, and that, complete integration of the black race with the white race in America, with no distinction of color in political, civil or social life. There is no doubt but what this is the great end toward which humanity is tending, and that so long as there are artificially emphasized differences of nationality, race and color, not to mention the fundamental discriminations of economic class, there will be no real Humanity.\nOn the other hand, it is just as clear, that not for a century and more probably not for ten centuries, will any such consummation be reached. No person born will ever live to see national and racial distinctions, altogether abolished, and economic distinctions will last many a day.\nSince this is true, the practical problem that faces us is not a choice between segregation and no segregation, between compulsory interferences with human intercourse and complete liberty of contact; the thing that faces us is given varying degrees of segregation. How shall we conduct ourselves so that in the end human differences will not be emphasized at the expense of human advance.\nIt is perfectly certain that, not only shall we be compelled to submit to much segregation, but that sometimes it will be necessary to our survival and a step toward the ultimate breaking down of barriers, to increase by voluntary action our separation from our fellowmen.\nWhen my room-mate gets too noisy and dirty, I leave him; when my neighbors get too annoying and insulting I seek another home; when white Americans refuse to treat me as a man, I will cut my intercourse with white Americans to the minimum demanded by decent living.\nIt may be and often has been true that oppression and insult have become so intense and so unremitting that there is no alternative left to self-respecting men but to herd by themselves in self-defense, until the attitude of the world changes. It happens that today is peculiarly a day when such voluntary union for self-expression and self-defense is forced upon large numbers of people. We may rail against this. We may say that it is not our fault, and it certainly is not. Nevertheless, to do nothing in the face of it: to accept opposition without united counter opposition is the program of fools.\nMoreover if association and contact with Negroes is distasteful to you, what is it to white people? Remember that the white people of America will certainly never want us until we want ourselves. We excuse ourselves in this case and say we do not hate Negroes but we do hate their condition, and immediately the answer is thrown back on us in the very words. Whose job is it to change that condition? The job of the white people or the job of the black people themselves, and especially of their uplifted classes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Race Segregation (1934)\nHistory of Segregation Philosophy (1934)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nSegregation (1934)\nSegregation (1910)"

    "text": "In recent years, it has been my custom to visit Chicago and regions about it, at least once a year, and to use the excuse of lecturing in order to become acquainted again, at first hand, with the great Middle West. It is painfully easy in the United States for a great metropolis to mistake itself for the nation. This was once true of Boston. In some respects, it is true of Washington. Nearly always, it is true of New York; and the great difficulty of argument and understanding for the nation today, is that with the concentration of power and brains in New York, it is so easily assumed that there is no power, that there are no centers of thought and development outside of Manhattan Island.\nThis year and last, I have not only viewed the national scene from Georgia, but also gone for brief visits into Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas. And finally, I took a trip West in March.\nI went to Indianapolis, after a lapse of seven years. A pause had come in my activities there, caused by the fact that in my last visit, I took occasion to preach to the white ministers of that city on the text: “Of All Forces for Social Uplift, I have Least Faith in White Christian Ministers.”\nI am afraid that I did not quite convince my auditors, although, personally, I was sincere. At any rate, the white man who then headed the city Y.M.C.A., refused to sanction further lectures from me. When I came back this year, I asked after him. It seems that he is retired, and living in New York.\nI had an excellent audience of six or seven hundred people, and talked about segregation. I did not have time to see much of the city, or note its changes. I hurried on, then, to what proved to be the central point of my trip. And that was, the experiment in Adult Education at Des Moines, Iowa.\nI am a firm and even extreme believer in Adult Education. The curious assumption that a child, after learning to read, write and count, can, in a four years’ high school course, or none at all, apprehend the knowledge and experience of the world, is silly. All life should be education, and there should be enough time and opportunity to let every human being study from grammar school to grave.\nMoreover, the place of Adult Education is in the public school system. It was a grave mistake in New York City, and elsewhere, to try to ingraft Adult Education upon the Library. If the Library had been, as it might be, a part of an educational system, instead of an institution catering to the select few, there would have been better argument, but not good argument, even in that case.\nIn Des Moines, a city of a hundred thousand people, an organization of Adult Education through neighborhood and city-wide lectures, with the use of lecturers from all lands, and all walks of life, has actually reached thirty thousand people. The lectures have become widely attended public institutions. No wonder that race prejudice in Des Moines plays a small role. I stayed in an excellent hotel, and ate in the public dining room. There were, so far as I have heard, no deaths.\nKansas City shows progress. In my first visit there, over a quarter of a century ago, I saw the results of bomb-throwing, to keep colored people from living on decent streets. Later, I remember a stone wall built to mark the dead-line between white and black habitants. Today, there are evident changes. I spoke at a dinner of social workers, where nearly half the diners were white. That would have been impossible in Kansas City ten years ago. I visited the city hospital. It is a segregated racial institution; but it is large, well-built, and commodious. It is manned with Negro physicians and nurses, from top to bottom, and I am glad it is there. There may be some people who would prefer to have colored patients subordinated and mistreated in the city hospital by white physicians and white nurses. But I’m not among these people. If a city hospital were possible without discrimination as to physicians or patients, that would be ideal. But that is unthinkable today in Kansas City.\nI saw Lincoln University at Jefferson City, with an astonishing young and new faculty, from the President down. It has, both advantages and disadvantages. There is a certain lack of tradition and experience; a sort of terrible newness; and on the other hand, everything seems possible. What more can one ask?\nThen I went to Chicago, and spoke to some young people, who evidently had the idea that they were going to force me into a corner and make rational defense of what I believed quite impossible. It was just a bit funny.\nThe subject which they chose for me was, “Resolved, That the Negro Should Seek a Separate Culture in the United States.” The defenders of the “49th State” were there in force, and the embattled opponents of segregation. My answer was, naturally, that the Negro should not seek a separate culture in the United States. And that segregation was evil, and should be systematically fought.\nAnd then, I turned to my thesis; namely, that the members of that audience were segregated, even in the case of my lecture, and they were going to be segregated as long as they lived. And that fight as they would or ought, they had got to arrange to make the best of their life in a segregated world, and that was our present job.\nI came down to Cincinnati to hear Dabney play “The Spanish Fandango,” a ceremony, which, for my soul’s good, I repeat as often as the Lord lets me. It was quite perfect as usual. Incidentally, I lectured in old Allen Chapel, and spoke again on Segregation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nY.M.C.A (1914)\nMy Mission (1919)\nSegregation in the North (1934)\nI Go A-Talking (1913)\nRoosevelt (1917)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1934. “Westward Ho.” The Crisis 41\n(5): 148. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/41/05/westward_ho.html."

    "title": "William Monroe Trotter",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Monroe Trotter was a man of heroic proportions, and probably one of the most selfless of Negro leaders during all our American history. His father was Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia, at the time when Recorders were paid by fees; and as a result, he retired from office with a small fortune, which he husbanded carefully. Thus, his son was born in comfortable circumstances, and with his talent for business, and his wide acquaintanceship with the best class of young Massachusetts men in his day, might easily have accumulated wealth.\nBut he turned aside. He had in his soul all that went to make a fanatic, a knight errant. Ready to sacrifice himself, fearing nobody and nothing, strong in body, sturdy in conviction, full of unbending belief.\nI remember when I first saw him as a student at Harvard. He was several classes below me. I should liked to have known him and spoken to him, but he was curiously aloof. He was even then forming his philosophy of life. Colored students must not herd together just because they were colored. He had his white friends and companions, and they liked him. He was no hanger-on, but a leader among them. But he did not seek other colored students as companions. I was a bit lonesome in those days, but I saw his point, and I did not seek him.\nOut of this rose his life-long philosophy: Intense hatred of all racial discrimination and segregation. He was particularly incensed at the compromising philosophy of Booker T. Washington; at his industrialism, and his condoning of the deeds of the South.\nIn the first years of the 20th Century, with George Forbes, Monroe Trotter began the publication of The Guardian. Several times young men have started radical sheets among us, like The Messenger, and others. But nothing, I think, that for sheer biting invective and unswerving courage, ever quite equaled the Boston Guardian in its earlier days. Mr. Washington and his followers literally shriveled before it, and it was, of course, often as unfair as it was inspired.\nI had come to know Trotter, then, especially because I knew Deenie Pindell as a girl before they were married. We were to stop with them one summer. Mrs. Du Bois was already there when I arrived in Boston, and on the elevated platform, I learned of the Zion Church riot. It was called a riot in the newspapers, and they were full of it. As a matter of fact, Trotter and Forbes had tried to ask Booker T. Washington certain pointed questions, after a speech which he made in the colored church; and immediately he was arrested, according to the careful plans which William L. Lewis, Washington’s attorney, had laid. I was incensed at Trotter. I thought that he had been needlessly violent, and had compromised me as his guest; but when I learned the exact facts, and how little cause for riot there was, and when they clapped Trotter in the Charles Street Jail, all of us more conservative, younger men rose in revolt.\nOut of this incident, within a year or two, arose the Niagara movement, and Trotter was present.\nBut Trotter was not an organization man. He was a free lance; too intense and sturdy to loan himself to that compromise which is the basis of all real organization. Trouble arose in the Niagara movement, and afterward when the Niagara movement joined the new N.A.A.C.P., Trotter stood out in revolt, and curiously enough, did not join the new organization because of his suspicion of the white elements who were co-operating with us.\nHe devoted himself to The Guardian, and it became one of the first of the nation-wide colored weeklies. His wife worked with him in utter devotion; giving up all thought of children; giving up her pretty home in Roxbury; living and lunching with him in the Guardian Office, and knowing hunger and cold. It was a magnificent partnership, and she died to pay for it.\nThe Trotter philosophy was carried out remorselessly in his paper, and his philosophy. He stood unflinchingly for fighting separation and discrimination in church and school, and in professional and business life. He would not allow a colored Y.M.C.A. in Boston, and he hated to recognize colored churches, or colored colleges. On this battle line he fought a long, exhausting fight for over a quarter of a century. What has been the result? There are fewer Negroes in Boston churches today than when Trotter began a crusade, and colored people sat in the pews under Phillips Brooks’ preaching. There may be more colored teachers in the schools, but certainly they are playing no such part as Maria Baldwin did, as principal of the best Cambridge Grammar School.\nWhen Trotter began, not a single hotel in Boston dared to refuse colored guests. Today, there are few Boston hotels where colored people are received. There is still no colored Y.M.C.A., but on the other hand, there are practically no colored members of the white “Y,” and young colored men are deprived of club house and recreational facilities which they sorely need. In the professions, in general employment, and in business, there is certainly not less, and probably more discrimination than there used to be.\nDoes this mean that Monroe Trotter’s life was a failure? Never. He lived up to his belief to the best of his ability. He fought like a man. The ultimate object of his fighting was absolutely right, but he miscalculated the opposition. He thought that Boston and America would yield to clear reason and determined agitation. They did not. On the contrary, to some extent, the very agitation carried on in these years has solidified opposition. This does not mean that agitation does not pay; but it means that you cannot necessarily cash in quickly upon it. It means that sacrifice, even to blood and tears, must be given to this great fight; and not one but a thousand lives, like that of Monroe Trotter, is necessary to victory.\nMore than that, inner organization is demanded. The free lance like Trotter is not strong enough. The mailed fist has got to be clenched. The united effort of twelve millions has got to be made to mean more than the individual effort of those who think aright. Yet this very inner organization involves segregation. It involves voluntary racial organization, and this racial grouping invites further effort at enforced segregation by law and custom from without. Nevertheless, there is no alternative. We have got to unite to save ourselves, and while the unbending devotion to principle, such as Monroe Trotter shows, has and must ever have, its value, with sorrow, and yet with conviction, we know that this is not enough.\n \nI can understand his death. I can see a man of sixty, tired and disappointed, facing poverty and defeat. Standing amid indifferent friends and triumphant enemies. So he went to the window of his Dark Tower, and beckoned to Death; up from where She lay among the lilies. And Death, like a whirlwind, swept up to him. I shall think of him as lying silent, cold and still; at last at peace, dreamless and serene. Let no trump of doom disturb him from his perfect and eternal rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWilliam Monroe Trotter (1914)\nOn Being Ashamed of Oneself (1933)\nTillman (1918)\nSocial Equality (1916)\nCourts and Jails (1932)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1934. “William Monroe Trotter.”\nThe Crisis 41 (5): 134. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/41/05/trotter.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There is a good deal of misapprehension as to the historic attitude of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and race segregation. As a matter of fact, the Association, while it has from time to time discussed the larger aspects of this matter, has taken no general stand and adopted no general philosophy. Of course its action, and often very effective action, has been in specific cases of segregation where the call for a definite stand was clear and decided. For instance, in the preliminary National Negro Convention which met in New York May 31st and June 1st, 1909, segregation was only mentioned in a protest against Jim-Crow car laws and that because of an amendment by William M. Trotter. In the First Annual Report, January 1, 1911, the Association evolved a statement of its purpose, which said that “it seeks to uplift the colored men and women of this country by securing to them the full enjoyment of their rights as citizens, justice in all courts, and equality of opportunity everywhere.” Later, this general statement was epitomized in the well-known declaration: “It conceives its mission to be the completion of the work which the great Emancipator began. It proposes to make a group of ten million Americans free from the lingering shackles of past slavery, physically free from peonage, mentally free from ignorance, politically free from disfranchisement, and socially free from insult.” This phrase which I first wrote myself for the Annual Report of 1915 still expresses pregnantly the object of the N.A.A.C.P. and it has my own entire adherence.\nIt will be noted, however, that here again segregation comes in only by implication. Specifically, it was first spoken of in the Second Report of the Association, January 1, 1912, when the attempt to destroy the property of Negroes in Kansas City because they had moved into a white section was taken up. This began our fight on a specific phase of segregation, namely, the attempt to establish a Negro ghetto by force of law. This phase of segregation we fought vigorously for years and often achieved notable victories in the highest courts of the land.\nBut it will be noted here that the N.A.A.C.P. expressed no opinion as to whether it might not be a feasible and advisable thing for colored people to establish their own residential sections, or their own towns; and certainly there was nothing expressed or implied that Negroes should not organize for promoting their own interests in industry, literature or art. Manifestly, here was opportunity for considerable difference of opinion, but the matter never was thoroughly threshed out.\nThe Association moved on to other matters of color discrimination: the “Full Crew” bills which led to dismissal of so many Negro railway employees; the “Jim-Crow” car laws on railway trains and street cars; the segregation in government departments. In all these matters, the stand of the Association was clear and unequivocal: it held that it was a gross injustice to make special rules which discriminated against the color of employees or patrons.\nIn the Sixth Annual Report issued in March, 1916, the seven lines of endeavor of the Association included change of unfair laws, better administration of present laws, justice in the courts, stoppage of public slander, the investigation of facts, the encouragement of distinguished work by Negroes, and organizations.\nVery soon, however, there came up a more complex question and that was the matter of Negro schools. The Association had avoided from the beginning any thoroughgoing pronouncement on this matter. In the resolutions of 1909, the conference asked: “Equal educational opportunities for all and in all the states, and that public school expenditure be the same for the Negro and white child.” This of course did not touch the real problem of separate schools. Very soon, however, definite problems were presented to the Association: the exclusion of colored girls from the Oberlin dormitories in 1919; the discrimination in the School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania; and the Cincinnati fight against establishing a separate school for colored children, brought the matter squarely to the front. Later, further cases came; the Brooklyn Girls’ High School, the matter of a colored High School in Indianapolis, and the celebrated Gary case.\nGradually, in these cases the attitude of the Association crystalized. It declared that further extension of segregated schools for particular races and especially for Negroes was unwise and dangerous, and the Association undertook in all possible cases to oppose such further segregation. It did not, however, for a moment feel called upon to attack the separate schools where most colored children are educated throughout the United States and it refrained from this not because it approved of separate schools, but because it was faced by a fact and not a theory. It saw no sense in tilting against windmills.\nThe case at Cheyney was a variation; here was an old and separate private school which became in effect though not in law a separate public normal school; and in the city of Philadelphia a partial system of elementary Negro schools was developed with no definite action on the part of the N.A.A.C.P.\nIt will be seen that in all these cases the Association was attacking specific instances and not attempting to lay down any general rule as to how far the advancement of the colored race in the United States was going to involve separate racial action and segregated organization of Negroes for certain ends.\nTo be sure, the overwhelming and underlying thought of the N.A.A.C.P. has always been: that any discrimination based simply on race is fundamentally wrong, and that consequently purely racial organizations must have strong justification to be admissable. On the other hand, they faced certain unfortunate but undeniable facts. For instance, War came. The Negro was being drafted. No Negro officers were being commissioned. The N.A.A.C.P. asked for the admission of Negroes to the officers’ schools. This was denied. There was only one further thing to do and that was to ask for a school for Negro officers. There arose a bitter protest among many Negroes against this movement. Nevertheless, the argument for it was absolutely unanswerable, and Joel E. Spingarn, Chairman of the Board, supported by the students of Howard University, launched a movement which resulted in the commissioning of seven hundred Negro officers if the A. E. F. In all the British Dominions, with their hundreds of millions of colored folk, there was not a single officer of known Negro blood. The American Negro scored a tremendous triumph against the Color Line by their admitted and open policy of segregation. This did not mean that Mr. Spingarn or any of the members of the N.A.A.C.P. thought it right that there should be a separate Negro camp, but they thought a separate Negro camp and Negro officers was infinitely better than no camp and no Negro officers and that was the only practical choice that lay before them.\nSimilarly, in the question of the Negro vote, the N.A.A.C.P. began in 1920 an attempt to organize the Negro vote and cast it in opposition to open enemies of the Negro race who were running for office. This was without doubt a species of segregation. It was appealing to voters on the grounds of race, and it brought for that reason considerable opposition. Nevertheless, it could be defended on the ground that the election of enemies of the Negro race was not only a blow to that race but to the white race and to all civilization. And while our attitude, even in the Parker case, has been criticized, it has on the whole found abundant justification.\nThe final problem in segregation presented to us was that of the Harlem Hospital. Here was a hospital in the center of a great Negro population which for years did not have and would not admit a single Negro physician to its staff. Finally, by agitation and by political power, Negroes obtained representation on the staff in considerable numbers and membership on the Board of Control. It was a great triumph. But it was accompanied by reaction on the part of whites and some Negroes who had opposed this movement, and an attempt to change the status of the hospital so that it would become a segregated Negro hospital, and so that presumably the other hospitals of the city would continue to exclude Negroes from their staffs. With this arose a movement to establish Negro hospitals throughout the United States.\nHere was an exceedingly difficult problem. On the one hand, there is no doubt of the need of the Negro population for wider and better hospitalization; and of the demand or the part of Negro physicians for opportunities of hospital practice. This was illustrated by the celebrated Tuskegee hospital where nearly all the Negro veterans are segregated but where an efficient Negro staff has been installed. Perhaps nothing illustrates better than this the contradiction and paradox of the problem of race segregation in the United States, and the problem which the N.A.A.C.P. faced and still faces.\nThe N.A.A.C.P. opposed the initial establishment of the hospital at Tuskegee although it is doubtful if it would have opposed such a hospital in the North. On the other hand, once established, we fought to defend the Tuskegee hospital and give it widest opportunity.\nIn other words, the N.A.A.C.P. has never officially opposed separate Negro organizations—such as churches, schools and business and cultural organizations. It has never denied the recurrent necessity of united separate action on the part of Negroes for self-defense and self-development; but it has insistently and continually pointed out that such action is in any case a necessary evil involving often a recognition from within of the very color line which we are fighting without. That race pride and race loyalty, Negro ideals and Negro unity, have a place and function today, the N.A.A.C.P. never has denied and never can deny.\nBut all this simply touches the whole question of racial organization and initiative. No matter what we may wish or say, the vast majority of the Negroes in the United States are born in colored homes, educated in separate colored schools, attend separate colored churches, marry colored mates, and find their amusement in colored Y.M.C.A.’s and Y.W.C.A.’s. Even in their economic life, they are gradually being forced out of the place in industry which they occupied in the white world and are being compelled to seek their living among themselves. Here is segregation with a vengeance, and its problems must be met and its course guided. It would be idiotic simply to sit on the side lines and yell: “No segregation” in an increasingly segregated world.\nOn the other hand, the danger of easily and eagerly yielding to suggested racial segregation without reason or pressure stares us ever in the face. We segregate ourselves. We herd together. We do things such as this clipping from the Atlanta Constitution indicates:\n\nA lecture on the raising of Lazarus from the dead will be delivered at the city auditorium on Friday night. The Big Bethel choir will sing and the Graham Jackson band will give additional music. Space has been set aside for white people.\n\nThe “Jim Crow” galleries of Southern moving picture houses are filled with some of the best Negro citizens. Separate schools and other institutions have been asked by Negroes in the north when the whites had made no real demand.\nSuch are the flat and undeniable facts. What are we going to do about them? We can neither yell them down nor make them disappear by resolutions. We must think and act. It is this problem which The Crisis dgsires to discuss during the present year in all its phases and with ample and fair representation to all shades of opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nWhite Co-Workers (1920)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nSegregation in the North (1934)\nUnity (1924)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1934. “The N.A.A.C.P.

    "text": "The thinking colored people of the United States must stop being stampeded by the word segregation. The opposition to racial segregation is not or should not be any distaste or unwillingness of colored people to work with each other, to cooperate with each other, to live with each other. The opposition to segregation is an opposition to discrimination. The experience in the United States has been that usually when there is racial segregation, there is also racial discrimination.\nBut the two things do not necessarily go together, and there should never be an opposition to segregation pure and simple unless that segregation does involve discrimination. Not only is there no objection to colored people living beside colored people if the surroundings and treatment involve no discrimination, if streets are well lighted, if there is water, sewerage and police protection, and if anybody of any color who wishes, can live in that neighborhood. The same way in schools, there is no objection to schools attended by colored pupils and taught by colored teachers. On the contrary, colored pupils can by our own contention be as fine human beings as any other-sort of children, and we certainly know that there are no teachers better than trained colored teachers. But if the existence of such a school is made reason and cause for giving it worse housing, poorer facilities, poorer equipment and poorer teachers, then we do object, and the objection is not against the color of the pupils’ or teachers’ skins, but against the discrimination.\nIn the recent endeavor of the United States government to redistribute capital so that some of the disadvantaged groups may get a chance for development, the American Negro should voluntarily and insistently demand his share. Groups of communities and farms inhabited by colored folk should be voluntarily formed. In no case should there be any discrimination against white and blacks. But, at the same time, colored people should come forward, should organize and conduct enterprises, and their only insistence should be that the same provisions be made for the success of their enterprise that is being made for the success of any other enterprise. It must be remembered that in the last quarter of a century, the advance of the colored people has been mainly in the lines where they themselves working by and for themselves, have accomplished the greatest advance.\nThere is no doubt that numbers of white people, perhaps the majority of Americans, stand ready to take the most distinct advantage of voluntary segregation and cooperation among colored people. Just as soon as they get a group of black folk segregated, they use it as a point of attack and discrimination. Our counter attack should be, therefore, against this discrimination; against the refusal of the South to spend the same amount of money on the black child as on the white child for its education; against the inability of black groups to use public capital; against the monopoly of credit by white groups. But never in the world should our fight be against association with ourselves because by that very token we give up the whole argument that we are worth associating with.\nDoubtless, and in the long run, the greatest human development is going to take place under experiences of widest individual contact. Nevertheless, today such individual contact is made difficult and almost impossible by petty prejudice, deliberate and almost criminal propaganda and various survivals from prehistoric heathenism. It is impossible, therefore, to wait for the millennium of free and normal intercourse before we unite, to cooperate among themselves in groups of like-minded people and in groups of people suffering from the same disadvantages and the same hatreds.\nIt is the class-conscious working man uniting together who will eventually emancipate labor throughout the world. It is the race-conscious black man cooperating together in his own institutions and movements who will eventually emancipate the colored race, and the great step ahead today is for the American Negro to accomplish his economic emancipation through voluntary determined cooperative effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSegregation (1910)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nHistory of Segregation Philosophy (1934)\nSegregation in the North (1934)\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Race Segregation (1934)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1934. “Segregation.” The Crisis 41\n(1): 20. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/41/01/segregation.html."

Never, and nonsense. Our business in this world is to fight and fight again, and never to yield. But after all, one must fight with his brains, if he has any. He gathers strength to fight. He gathers knowledge, and he raises children who are proud to fight and who know what they are fighting about. And above all, they learn that what they are fighting for is the opportunity and the chance to know and associate with black folk. They are not fighting to escape themselves. They are fighting to say to the world: the opportunity of knowing Negroes is worth so much to us and is so appreciated, that we want you to know them too.\nNegroes are not extraordinary human beings. They are just like other human beings, with all their foibles and ignorance and mistakes. But they are human beings, and human nature is always worth knowing, and withal, splendid in its manifestations. Therefore, we are fighting to keep open the avenues of human contact; but in the meantime, we are taking every advantage of what opportunities of contact are already open to us, and among those opportunities which are open, and which are splendid and inspiring, is the opportunity of Negroes to work together in the twentieth century for the uplift and development of the Negro race. It is no counsel of despair to emphasize and hail the opportunity for such work."

    "text": "The Anti-Segregation Campaign\nThe assumptions of the anti-segregation campaign have been all wrong. This is not our fault, but it is our misfortune. When I went to Atlanta University to teach in 1897, and to study the Negro problem, I said, confidently, that the basic problem is our racial ignorance and lack of culture. That once Negroes know civilization, and whites know Negroes, then the problem is solved. This proposition is still true, but the solution is much further away that my youth dreamed. Negroes are still ignorant, but the disconcerting thing is that white people on the whole are just as much opposed to Negroes of education and culture, as to any other kind, and perhaps more so. Not all whites, to be sure, but the overwhelming majority.\nOur main method, then, falls flat. We stop training ability. We lose our manners. We swallow our pride, and beg for things. We agitate and get angry. And with all that, we face the blank fact: Negroes are not wanted; neither as scholars nor as business men; neither as clerks nor as artisans; neither as artists nor as writers. What can we do about it? We cannot use force. We cannot enforce law, even if we get it on the statute books. So long as overwhelming public opinion sanctions and justifies and defends color segregation, we are helpless, and without remedy. We are segregated. We are cast back upon ourselves, to an Island Within; “To your tents, Oh Israel!”\nSurely then, in this period of frustration and disappointment, we must turn from negation to affirmation, from the ever-lasting “No” to the ever-lasting “Yes.” Instead of sitting, sapped of all initiative and independence; instead of drowning our originality in imitation of mediocre white folks; instead of being afraid of ourselves and cultivating the art of skulking to escape the Color Line; we have got to renounce a program that always involves humiliating self-stultifying scrambling to crawl somewhere where we are not wanted; where we crouch panting like a whipped dog. We have got to stop this and learn that on such a program they cannot build manhood. No, by God, stand erect in a mud-puddle and tell the white world to go to hell, rather than lick boots in a parlor.\nAffirm, as you have a right to affirm, that the Negro race is one of the great human races, inferior to none in its accomplishment and in its ability. Different, it is true, and for most of the difference, let us reverently thank God. And this race, with its vantage grounds in modern days, can go forward of its own will, of its own power, and its own initiative. It is led by twelve million American Negroes of average modern intelligence; three or four million educated African Negroes are their full equals, and several million Negroes in the West Indies and South America. This body of at least twenty-five million modern men are not called upon to commit suicide because somebody doesn’t like their complexion or their hair. It is their opportunity and their day to stand up and make themselves heard and felt in the modern world.\nIndeed, there is nothing else we can do. If you have passed your resolution, “No segregation, Never and Nowhere,” what are you going to do about it? Let me tell you what you are going to do. You are going back to continue to make your living in a Jim-Crow school; you are going to dwell in a segregated section of the city; you are going to pastor a Jim-Crow Church; you are going to occupy political office because of Jim-Crow political organizations that stand back of you and force you into office. All these things and a thousand others you are going to do because you have got to.\nIf you are going to do this, why not say so? What are you afraid of? Do you believe in the Negro race or do you not? If you do not, naturally, you are justified in keeping still. But if you do believe in the extraordinary accomplishment of the Negro church and the Negro college, the Negro school and the Negro newspaper, then say so and say so plainly, not only for the sake of those who have given their lives to make these things worthwhile, but for those young people whom you are teaching, by that negative attitude, that there is nothing that they can do, nobody that they can emulate, and no field worthwhile working in. Think of what Negro art and literature has yet to accomplish if it can only be free and untrammeled by the necessity of pleasing white folks! Think of the splendid moral appeal that you can make to a million children tomorrow, if once you can get them to see the possibilities of the American Negro today and now, whether he is segregated or not, or in spite of all possible segregation."

That the technique is to protest and wail and protest again, and to keep this thing up until the gates of public opinion and the walls of segregation fall down.\nThe difficulty with this program is that it is physically and psychologically impossible. It would be stopped by cold and hunger and strained voices, and it is an undignified and impossible attitude and method to maintain indefinitely. Let us, therefore, remember that this program must be modified by adding to it a positive side. Make the protest, and keep on making it, systematically and thoughtfully. Perhaps now and then even hysterically and theatrically; but at the same time, go to work to prepare methods and institutions which will supply those things and those opportunities which we lack because of segregation. Stage boycotts which will put Negro clerks in the stores which exploit Negro neighborhoods. Build a 15th Street Presbyterian Church, when the First Presbyterian would rather love Jesus without your presence. Establish and elaborate a Washington system of public schools, comparable to any set of public schools in the nation; and then when you have done this, and as you are doing it, and while in the process you are saving your voice and your temper, say softly to the world: see what a precious fool you are. Here are stores as efficiently clerked as any where you trade. Here is a church better than most of yours. Here are a set of schools where you should be proud to send your children."

On page 11, I read with interest this bit:\n\nHere, then, is the dilemma, and it is a puzzling one, I admit. No Negro who has given earnest thought to the situation of his people in America has failed, at some time in life, to find himself at these cross-roads; has failed to ask himself at some time: What, after all, am I? Am I an American or am I a Negro? Can I be both? Or is it my duty to cease to be a Negro as soon as possible and be an American? If I strive as a Negro, am I not perpetuating the very cleft that threatens and separates Black and White America? Is not my only possible practical aim the subduction of all that is Negro in me to the American? Does my black blood place upon me any more obligation to assert my nationality than German, or Irish or Italian blood would?\n\nIt is such incessant self-questioning and the hesitation that arises from it, that is making the present period a time of vacillation and contradiction for the American Negro; combined race action is stifled, race responsibility is shirked, race enterprises languish, and the best blood, the best talent, the best energy of the Negro people cannot be marshalled to do the bidding of the race. They stand back to make room for every rascal and demagogue who chooses to cloak his selfish deviltry under the veil of race pride.\n\nIs this right? Is it rational? Is it good policy? Have we in America a distinct mission as a race—a distinct sphere of action and an opportunity for race development, or is self-obliteration the highest end to which Negro blood dare aspire?\n\nOn the whole, I am rather pleased to find myself still so much in sympathy with myself."

    "text": "Methods of Attack\nWhen an army moves to attack, there are two methods which it may pursue. The older method, included brilliant forays with bugles and loud fanfare of trumpets, with waving swords, and shining uniforms. In Coryn’s “The Black Eagle,” which tells the story of Bertrand du Guesclin, one sees that kind of fighting power in the fourteenth century. It was thrilling, but messy, and on the whole rather ineffective.\nThe modern method of fighting, is not nearly as spectacular. It is preceded by careful, very careful planning. Soldiers are clad in drab and rather dirty khaki. Officers are not riding out in front and using their swords; they sit in the rear and use their brains. The whole army digs in and stays hidden. The advance is a slow, calculated forward mass movement. Now going forward, now advancing in the center, now running around by the flank. Often retreating to positions that can be better defended. And the whole thing depending upon G.H.Q.; that is, the thought and knowledge and calculations of the great general staff. This is not nearly as spectacular as the older method of fighting, but it is much more effective, and against the enemy of present days, it is the only effective way. It is common sense based on modern technique.\nAnd this is the kind of method which we trust use to solve the Negro problem and to win our fight against segregation. There are times when a brilliant display of eloquence and picketing and other theatrical and spectacular things are not only excusable but actually gain ground. But in practically all cases, this is true simply because of the careful thought and planning that has gone before. And it is a waste of time and effort to think that the spectacular demonstration is the real battle.\nThe real battle is a matter of study and thought; of the building up of loyalties; of the long training of men; of the growth of institutions; of the inculcation of racial and national ideals. It is not a publicity stunt. It is a life."

It seems that the alliance fell afoul of ordinances against picketing, but that this did not result altogether in failure. Two pickets were arrested, and finally, after a month or so, the complaints were dismissed. In another case, a complaint and temporary injunction is still being fought out before the courts. This is fine. We are glad that the picketing has met with so much of success and we hope that in Washington, as in Chicago, ultimate success will come.\nFurther than this, the alliance explains that what it is doing, is asking for clerks whose color in the main shall correspond to neighborhoods. If there is a store in a black neighborhood, there should be at least some black clerks in the store. With this, we quite agree, and say, as we said in the Chicago case, that this is fighting segregation with segregation. If there are, for instance (and there certainly are in Washington), segregated neighborhoods, don’t squat before segregation and bawl. Use segregation. Use every bit that comes your way and transmute it into power. Power that some day will smash all race separation. In the meantime, call it what you will. If the Negro Alliance wishes to say that it is not fighting segregation with segregation, it can call the thing that it is doing Transubstantiation or Willipuswallipus. Whatever they call it, that is what we both mean."

    "text": "Negro Fraternities\nNothing better illustrates our current philosophy and practice in segregation, than the rise and development of Negro fraternities in colleges. When I was a student, fraternities were not allowed in Negro colleges and in the white colleges almost no fraternity ever accepted a Negro member. For a long time, Negro students went their way accepting this situation. When given opportunity, they protested against the Color Line in fraternities, and in a few cases, where the admission to fraternities depended upon scholarship, they succeeded in breaking the Color Line.\nNevertheless, it soon became manifest that there were certain things that the college fraternity could do for a student, which colored students were not getting in the large Northern universities. They lacked very often dormitory facilities; they had no place where they could entertain visiting friends; they had no social center; they had no opportunity for companionship and conference and mutual inspiration.\nAt Cornell, therefore, in 1906, a group of students formed the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. There were many Negro students there, and in other places, at that time and since, who have condemned this movement as segregation while others excused it as voluntary segregation. It was segregation; and nevertheless, it was necessary; and it was voluntary only in the sense that either Negroes must have their own fraternity or forego fraternal advantages. It was, therefore, as a matter of fact just as compulsory as the “Jim-Crow” car.\nThis fraternity movement: has spread all over the United States. It has resulted in colored fraternities and sororities, whose membership runs into the thousands. If anyone has any doubt as to the meaning and inspiration of these fraternities, they should attend one of their national meetings and see the type of men and women that they are bringing together: the splendid enthusiasm, the inspiration and nationwide friendship. This is the kind of segregation that is forced upon us, and it is the kind of segregation in which we glory and which we are going to make the very finest type of institution that the United States has ever seen. And moreover, this is the singular and contradictory result: more Negroes have been taken into white fraternities since Negro fraternities started than ever before. The number thus admitted is still small, but it is not, as the timid argued, smaller; it is much larger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Strength of Segregation (1913)\nA Statement (1919)\nCrime (1920)\nLight (1912)\nOptimism (1929)"

The climate is severe and trying, but a healthy man who follows the rules of tropical hygiene can live there. There is, therefore, no necessary barrier of climate to keep American Negroes out of Africa.\nOn the other hand, it would be foolish for colored folk to assume that because their great grandfathers were Africans that the climate of Africa would have no terrors for them. It has its terrors for all men and these terrors can be overcome.\nThe present opportunity for emigration to Africa is, however, exceedingly limited. There is absolutely no chance for colored laborers. Men with capital, education and some technical or agricultural skill, who have the courage of pioneers, good health, and are willing to rough it, can find a career in Liberia, in some parts of French, Portuguese and Egyptian Africa (if they speak the language), and in some parts of British West Africa, if they are British subjects.

No one denies great differences of gift, capacity and attainment among individuals of all races, but the voice of science, religion and practical politics is one in denying the God-appointed existence of super-races, or of races naturally and inevitably and eternally inferior.\nThat in the vast range of time, one group should in its industrial technique, or social organization, or spiritual vision, lag a few hundred years behind another, or forge fitfully ahead, or come to differ decidedly in thought, deed and ideal, is proof of the essential richness and variety of human nature, rather than proof of the co-existence of demi-gods and apes in human form. The doctrine of racial equality does not interfere with individual liberty, rather, it fulfils it. And of all the various criteria by which masses of men have in the past been prejudged and classified, that of the color of the skin and texture of the hair, is surely the most adventitious and idiotic.\nIt is the duty of the world to assist in every way the advance of the backward and suppressed groups of mankind. The rise of all men is a menace to no one and is the highest human ideal; it is not an altruistic benevolence, but the one road to world salvation.\nFor the purpose of raising such peoples to intelligence, self-knowledge and self-control, their intelligentsia of right ought to be recognized as the natural leaders of their groups.\nThe insidious and dishonorable propaganda, which, for selfish ends, so distorts and denies facts as to represent the advancement and development of certain races of men as impossible and undesirable, should be met with widespread dissemination of the truth. The experiment of making the Negro slave a free citizen in the United States is not a failure; the attempts at autonomous government in Haiti and Liberia are not proofs of the impossibility of selfgovernment among black men; the experience of Spanish America does not prove that mulatto democracy will not eventually succeed there; the aspirations of Egypt and India are not successfully to be met by sneers at the capacity of darker races.\nWe who resent the attempt to treat civilized men as uncivilized, and who bring in our hearts grievance upon grievance against those who lynch the untried, disfranchise the intelligent, deny self-government to educated men, and insult the helpless, we complain; but not simply or primarily for ourselves—more especially for the millions of our fellows, blood of our blood, and flesh of our flesh, who have not even what we have—the power to complain against monstrous wrong, the power to see and to know the source of our oppression.\nHow far the future advance of mankind will depend upon the social contact and physical intermixture of the various strains of human blood is unknown, but the demand for the interpenetration of countries and intermingling of blood has come, in modern days, from the white race alone, and has been imposed upon brown and black folks mainly by brute force and fraud. On top of this, the resulting people of mixed race have had to endure innuendo, persecution, and insult, and the penetrated countries have been forced into semi-slavery.\nIf it be proven that absolute world segregation by group, color or historic affinity is best for the future, let the white race leave the dark world and the darker races will gladly leave the white. But the proposition is absurd. This is a world of men, of men whose likenesses far outweigh their differences; who mutually need each other in labor and thought and dream, but who can successfully have each other only on terms of equality, justice and mutual respect. They are the real and only peacemakers who work sincerely and peacefully to this end.\nThe beginning of wisdom in interracial contact is the establishment of political institutions among suppressed peoples. The habit of democracy must be made to encircle the earth. Despite the attempt to prove that its practice is the secret and divine gift of the few, no habit is more natural or more widely spread among primitive people, or more easily capable of development among masses. Local self-government with a minimum of help and oversight can be established tomorrow in Asia, in Africa, in America and in the Isles of the Sea. It will in many instances need general control and guidance, but it will fail only when that guidance seeks ignorantly and consciously its own selfish ends and not the people’s liberty and good.\nSurely in the 20th century of the Prince of Peace, in the millenium of Buddha and Mahmoud, and in the mightiest Age of Human Reason, there can be found in the civilized world enough of altruism, learning and benevolence to develop native institutions for the native’s good, rather than continue to allow the majority of mankind to be brutalized and enslaved by ignorant and selfish agents of commercial institutions, whose one aim is profit and power for the few.\nAnd this brings us to the crux of the matter: It is the shame of the world that today the relation between the main groups of mankind and their mutual estimate and respect is determined chiefly by the degree in which one can subject the other to its service, enslaving labor, making ignorance compulsory, uprooting ruthlessly religion and customs, and destroying government, so that the favored Few may luxuriate in the toil of the tortured Many. Science, Religion and Philanthropy have thus been made the slaves of world commerce and industry, and bodies, minds, souls of Fiji and Congo, are judged almost solely by the quotations on the Bourse.\nThe day of such world organization is past and whatever excuse be made for it in other ages, the 20th century must come to judge men as men and not as material and labor.\nThe great industrial problem which has hitherto been regarded as the domestic problem of culture lands, must be viewed far more broadly, if it is ever to reach just settlement. Labor and capital in England, France and America can never solve their problem as long as a similar and vastly greater problem of poverty and injustice marks the relations of the whiter and darker peoples. It is shameful, unreligious, unscientific and undemocratic that the estimate, which half the peoples of earth put on the other half, depends mainly on their ability to squeeze profit out of them.\nIf we are coming to recognize that the great modern problem is to correct maladjustment in the distribution of wealth, it must be remembered that the basic maladjustment is in the outrageously unjust distribution of world income between the dominant and suppressed peoples; in the rape of land and raw material, and monopoly of technique and culture. And in this crime white labor is particeps criminis with white capital. Unconsciously and consciously, carelessly and deliberately, the vast power of the white labor vote in modern democracies has been cajoled and flattered into imperialistic schemes to enslave and debauch black, brown and yellow labor, until with fatal retribution, they are themselves today bound and gagged and rendered impotent by the resulting monopoly of the world’s raw material in the hands of a dominant, cruel and irresponsible few.\nAnd, too, just as curiously, the educated and cultured of the world, the well-born and well-bred, and even the deeply pious and philanthropic, receive their training and comfort and luxury, the ministrations of delicate beauty and sensibility, on condition that they neither inquire into the real source of their income and the methods of distribution or interfere with the legal props which rest on a pitiful human foundation of writhing white and yellow and brown and black bodies.\nWe claim no perfectness of our own nor do we seek to escape the blame which of right falls on the backward for failure to advance, but noblesse oblige, and we arraign civilization and more especially the colonial powers for deliberate transgressions of our just demands and their own better conscience.\nEngland, with her Pax Britannica, her courts of justice, established commerce and a certain apparent recognition of native law and customs, has nevertheless systematically fostered ignorance among the natives, has enslaved them and is still enslaving some of them, has usually declined even to try to train black and brown men in real self-government, to recognize civilized black folks as civilized, or to grant to colored colonies those rights of self-government which it freely gives to white men.\nBelgium is a nation which has but recently assumed responsibility for her colonies, and has taken some steps to lift them from the worst abuses of the autocratic regime; but she has not confirmed to the people the possession of their land and labor, and she shows no disposition to allow the natives any voice in their own government, or to provide for their political future. Her colonial policy is still mainly dominated by the banks and great corporations. But we are glad to learn that the present government is considering a liberal program of reform for the future.\nPortugal and Spain have never drawn a legal caste line against persons of culture who happen to be of Negro descent. Portugal has a humane code for the natives and has begun their education in some regions. But, unfortunately, the industrial concessions of Portuguese Africa are almost wholly in the hands of foreigners whom Portugal cannot or will not control, and who are exploiting land and re-establishing the African slave trade.\nThe United States of America after brutally enslaving millions of black folks suddenly emancipated them and began their education; but it acted without system or forethought, throwing the freed men upon the world penniless and landless, educating them without thoroughness and system, and subjecting them the while to lynching, lawlessness, discrimination, insult and slander, such as human beings have seldom endured and survived. To save their own government, they enfranchized the Negro and then when danger passed, allowed hundreds of thousands of educated and civilized black folk to be lawlessly disfranchised and subjected to a caste system; and, at the same time, in 1176, 1812, 1861, 1897, and 1917, they asked and allowed thousands of black men to offer up their lives as a sacrifice to the country which despised and despises them.\nFrance alone of the great colonial powers has sought to place her cultured black citizens on a plane of absolute legal and social equality with her white and given them representation in her highest legislature. In her colonies she has a widespread but still imperfect system of state education. This splendid beginning must be completed by widening the political basis of her native government, by restoring to the indigenes the ownership of the soil, by protecting native labor against the aggression of established capital, and by asking no man, black or white, to be a soldier unless the country gives him a voice in his own government.\nThe independence of Abyssinia, Liberia Haiti and San Domingo, is absolutely necessary to any sustained belief of the black folk in the sincerity and honesty of the white. These nations have earned the right to be free, they deserve the recognition of the world; notwithstanding ell their faults and mistakes, and the fact that they are behind the most advanced civilization of the day, nevertheless they compare favorably with the past, and even more recent, history of most European nations, and it shames civilization that the treaty of London practically invited Italy to aggression in Abyssinia, and that free America has unjustly and cruelly seized Haiti, murdered and for a time enslaved her workmen, overthrown her free institutions by force, and has so far failed in return to give her a single bit of help, aid or sympathy.\nWhat do those wish who see these evils of the color line and racial discrimination and who believe in the divine right of suppressed and backward peoples to learn and aspire and be free?\nThe Negro race through its thinking intelligentsia is demanding:\n\n\nThe recognition of civilized men as civilized despite their race or color\n\nLocal self government for backward groups, deliberately rising as experience and knowledge grow to complete self government under the limitations of a self governed world\n\nEducation in self knowledge, in scientific truth and in industrial technique, undivorced from the art of beauty\n\nFreedom in their own religion and social customs, and with the right to be different and non-conformist\n\nCo-operation with the rest of the world in government, industry and art on the basis of Justice, Freedom and Peace\n\nThe ancient common ownership of the land and its natural fruits and defence against the unrestrained greed of invested capital\n\nThe establishment under the League of Nations of an international institution for the study of Negro problems\n\nThe establishment of an international section in the Labor Bureau of the League of Nations, charged with the protection of native labor.\n\nThe world must face two eventualities: either the complete assimilation of Africa with two or three of the great world states, with political, civil and social power and privileges absolutely equal for its black and white citizens, or the rise of a great black African state founded in Peace and Good Will, based on popular education, natural art and industry and freedom of trade; autonomous and sovereign in its internal policy, but from its beginning a part of a great society of peoples in which it takes its place with others as co-rulers of the world.\nIn some such words and thoughts as these we seek to express our will and ideal, and the end of our untiring effort. To our aid we call all men of the Earth who love Justice and Mercy. Out of the depths we have cried unto the deaf and dumb masters of the world. Out of the depths we cry to our own sleeping souls.\nThe answer is written in the stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRaces (1911)\nUnity (1924)\nResolutions of the Washington Conference (1917)\nSmuts (1930)\nPeace (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “To The World.” The Crisis\n23 (1): 5–10. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/23/01/to_the_world.html."

    "text": "Efficiency\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has, in its comparatively brief career, dealt Bourbonism in the United States three telling blows. First: by helping to secure the celebrated Grandfather Decision before the Supreme Court, it began the overthrow of Disfranchisement and secured the first official affirmation of the validity of the Fifteenth Amendment. Second: it dealt Caste in the Nation a telling blow when it secured the admission of nearly seven hundred Colored Officers of the United States Army. Third: in securing the Segregation Decision before the Supreme Court, it stopped the most outrageous invasion of the Negro’s rights yet attempted.\nIn addition to these three blows, it has fought for Civil Rights, encouraged ability through the Spingarn Medal, defeated Anti-Intermarriage Laws, watched Legislation, made Lynching a National question, and published the Truth.\nIt did not do these things single-handed but has worked always with all persons minded to work with it. In each case, however, it has furnished suggestion, encouragement, funds, and active organization.\nThis is surely a record which proves The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People the only national organization in the field today which can fight efficiently for the rights of the Negro and the one on which twelve million Negroes should concentrate with membership, encouragement and funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Next Step (1913)\nRadicals (1919)\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nThe N.A.A.C.P. and Race Segregation (1934)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1918. “Thirteen.” The Crisis 15\n(3): 115. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/15/03/efficiency.html."

    "text": "The Town\nDyersburg, Tenn., is a prosperous town of seventy-five hundred inhabitants, thirty per cent of whom are Negroes. It is the county seat of Dyer County, one of the wealthy counties of the State of Tennessee, and it is situated in the center of the county, which has a population of about thirty thousand. It is seventy-six miles north of Memphis, and two hundred miles south of St. Louis.\nThere is a good white public school and two colored public schools. The colored public school is divided into two sections, owing to the fact that some of the Negroes live on one side of the town and some on the other. The principal of the white school is paid fifteen hundred dollars a year; the principal of the colored school is paid one thousand dollars a year. There are six white and five Negro churches. The principal of the colored public school bears an excellent reputation among the white people, as do the ministers of the more established Negro churches. There are five colored physicians.\nWhile there are no immensely wealthy citizens, there are a number of men in well-to-do circumstances. Several residences in the town are worth from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars.\nTwo cotton compresses, a cotton oil mill, several large lumber concerns, and a number of other industries are carried on. The main railroad which passes through the town is the Illinois Central. There are three banks, one of which is national. While some of the colored people have fairly comfortable homes, the Negro populace lives, for the most part, in shacks and cabins, which are not fit for the housing of animals.\nThe present Mayor, Mayor Evans Carne, began the serving of his third term January, 1918. Under his administration, a new lighting system has been installed, streets have been opened, graded, and paved, and many other improvements have been made. It is stated that Mayor Carne has done more for the uplift of the town than any other Mayor."

    "section": "Lation Scott",
    "text": "Lation Scott\nThe Negro, who was burned at the stake in Dyersburg on December 2, was named Lation Scott. He also went by the name of Ligon Scott.\nHe had been employed during the crop season for about two years as the assistant of a white man, who rented and farmed a small section of a larger farm. This farm was in the Fourth District, two miles northeast of Dyersburg. The white farmer had been previously employed as driver of an express wagon; at the time of the crime he was employed as freight handler at the Dyersburg Depot.\nIt is assumed that the white farmer thought he could make more money, after crop season was over, by working in town, leaving the Negro to do the work on the farm. The farmer was, himself, under thirty years of age. His wife was twenty-four. They had been married four years and had two children, one of whom was the particular pet of Lation Scott.\nThe Negro was thirty years old, six feet and one inch tall, and weighed one hundred and fifty pounds. Accounts as to his intelligence vary widely. One report asserts that he was almost half-witted. Others attribute to him the intelligence of the average country Negro. A man who knew him states that his head was not well formed. Mr. States Miller, a white man who conducts a hardware store on the south side of the square in Dyersburg, and for whom he worked on a farm for a year or more, says that he regarded him as one with the average intelligence. He also says that during the time he worked for him no criminal or dishonest tendencies manifested themselves.\nHe had the reputation of being a splendid hand at doing general housework, or “spring-cleaning,” and a short time prior to the crime, of which he is accused, had done work of this sort for a prominent woman of Dyersburg. She states that she was alone in the house with him for two days. No trouble, however, resulted.\nIn addition to farming and the doing of odd jobs, he was a preacher. While some claim that he was a Baptist, or Methodist, Mr. John M. Tarrant, of the Dyer County Exemption Board, states positively that he was a Holy Roller. This sect is very strong among the Negroes and poorer white people in West Tennessee, and has been extremely active for the past few years. It is more than possible that he was a Baptist, and “went over” to the Holy Rollers.\nThe emotionalism of this sect is extreme. They claim the “gift of tongues,” and make a practice of going into trances. They jump, jerk, shout, sing, and do what is known as a “Holy Dance.” The white people who belong to this sect are, for the most part, inhabitants of the back country regions. It is generally felt among the more intelligent citizens that membership in the sect unfits a person for steady work, and effort is made to prevent reliable servants from joining it.\nIt was reported that he was a victim of an advanced case of syphillis. This story was widely circulated and unquestionably served to further inflame the passions of the white men who were searching for him. He was included in the selective draft. He did not sign his name to his examination blank, having made a mark instead. The investigator for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People visited the office of the Exemption Board and found that he was not exempt, but had passed the physical examination, and expected to be called for service at any time. He had recently been to the office to inquire when he would probably be called. At an earlier date, his employer had been at the office for the purpose of making the same inquiry, not wishing to lose the Negro’s services before his crops were laid by.\nSurprised to find that he was not exempt from service, as had been reported, the representative of the National Association repeated to the examining physician, who was present at the time, the report which had been accepted by the community, asking if it were then not true that he was in an advanced condition of venereal disease? The physician replied shortly that it was not true, or he would not have passed the physical examination."

    "text": "The Crime\nThe family for whom Lation Scott worked lived in a two-room box house. It is said that he sometimes slept in one of the rooms.\nDuring the day, while the farmer was in town at work, he worked on the farm. There was no one else on the place except the wife of the farmer and their two small children, both under four years of age.\nOn the day of November 22, when the crime was committed, the wife of the farmer was engaged in picking cotton bolls from stalks, which had been brought in from the field to be picked in the house.\nComing into the house, Scott approached the woman, when she was standing with her back turned, and threw a rope about her neck. He then bound her and, it is said, gagged her. He had either locked the older child in the barn before coming into the house, or else he went out and did so after tieing the woman, so that she could not escape. The report states that she begged for her life. He granted her plea on the condition that she would not tell what had occurred. It is, also, thought to be true that he granted her request because of his affection for the child.\nWhen he had left the place the woman ran out into the road, being apparently not tied to the extent of not using her limbs, and reported the occurrence to passers-by.\nThe news spread rapidly; parties of men set out at once to apprehend the Negro. From that day until the first of December, when he was arrested, posses of enraged white men hunted him through the country with bloodhounds.\nFor ten days he escaped detection, passing from house to house of colored friends and taking his way through the country. He could have gotten completely out of the community in that time, but this does not seem to have occurred to him.\nDescriptions of the Negro were published broadcast and a reward of two hundred dollars was offered for his apprehension. Feeling became very intense throughout Dyer and the adjoining counties. It was well known that if he were caught, he would be lynched. There seems to have been no question of this course on any side.\nHe was recognized on the afternoon of Saturday, December 1, by a section foreman near Jackson, a distance of forty-nine miles from Dyersburg. He was arrested by this foreman and turned over to Sheriff Perry, of Madison County, of which Jackson is the county seat. Sheriff Perry notified Sheriff Bryant of Dyer County. Sheriff Bryant went at once to Jackson.\nFrom that place Sheriff Bryant took the Negro to Union City, a town sixty-eight miles north of Jackson, and a point much used as a junction between Dyersburg and other places. Here he was put in jail. The following morning, when the Sheriff returned home, he found that news of the Negro’s whereabouts was known, and dispatched Deputy-Sheriff Cope Pursell and nightwatchman John Finney to Union City for the Negro. They were accompanied by Joe Curry, an undertaker, who owned and drove the automobile in which they made the trip, and Milton McGee, brother-in-law of the Sheriff.\nThey took him from the Union City Jail, which is a strong, substantial building, and started through the country with him. It is probable that some members of the mob had left Dyersburg before the officers did. The road which they took from Union City leads direct to Dyersburg.\nDefinite news of the Negro’s whereabouts seems to have spread rapidly. Automobiles began pouring toward Union City and into Dyersburg from the surrounding country. Twenty-five or thirty cars, crowded with men, went to meet the car of the officers, in whose charge the Negro was placed, with the purpose of getting possession of him. Seven-passenger cars were seen carrying twelve men. People stood on the running boards.\nThe cars carrying the mob were left at a safe point. The passengers hid in the woods which bordered the road. At a point in the Obion River bottom, between the towns of Trimble and Obion, they swarmed out of the cane-brakes and took possession of the Negro. One of the officers states that it was very muddy at this point, and that the automobile in which they were riding was running slowly.\nThe Negro was transferred to another car; then the whole party raced toward Dyersburg.\nIn the meantime, the public square of Dyersburg had become packed with automobiles and people. As each car came in sight the crowd surged toward it, in search of the Negro.\nA determination seems to have gotten abroad among some citizens to give the Negro a “trial.” A list of twenty-five or thirty names had been made, and the citizens to whom the names belonged were asked to serve on a jury. Twelve agreed to do so.\nIt was feared that the heated temper of the crowd would not permit of even a mob-trial. A prominent and popular citizen was asked to address the crowd, asking that the Negro should be given a trial. He did so, speaking from a point near the court house. It was agreed that this plan should be carried out.\nThirty minutes later the car carrying the Negro arrived in Dyersburg. Avoiding the streets which led to the court house from the north and east, along which the crowd naturally expected the car to arrive, it circled westward and came up to the south entrance of the court house."

Many stood on tables and backs of benches.\nMr. David Moss, manager of the Phoenix Cotton Oil Mill, a prominent citizen of the town, acted as spokesman. He told the Negro to stand up. Scott stood up.\n“Are you guilty or are you not guilty?”\nScott replied that he was guilty. In answer to inquiry the jury responded that it found him guilty. Mr. Moss then turned to the crowd and spoke for six or eight minutes, importuning the men to be moderate. He asked them to remember that it was Sunday, and stated that the reputation of the county was at stake. It is reported by some that he then appealed to the woman’s husband to prevent the mob from burning the Negro. The woman’s husband, however, did not respond to this appeal. It is reported that it was his wish, as well as the wish of the woman herself, that the Negro be burned at the stake."

    "text": "The Burning\nLation Scott was taken charge of at once by leaders of the mob, who carried him to a near-by vacant lot, the corner of which adjoins the public square, and which is within a stone’s throw of two churches and the residences of several ministers, as well as of the Mayor of the town. It is the property, jointly, of several sisters, prominent women of Dyersburg. The court house and the post office, attractive new buildings, are in sight of the spot.\nThe Negro was seated on the ground and a buggy-axle driven into the ground between his legs. His feet were chained together, with logging chains, and he was tied with wire. A fire was built. Pokers and flat-irons were procured and heated in the fire. It was thirty minutes before they were red-hot.\nReports of the torturing, which have been generally accepted and have not been contradicted, are that the Negro’s clothes and skin were ripped from his body simultaneously with a knife. His self-appointed executors burned his eye-balls with red-hot irons. When he opened his mouth to cry for mercy a red-hot poker was rammed down his gullet. In the same subtle way he was robbed of his sexual organs. Redhot irons were placed on his feet, back, and body, until a hideous stench of burning human flesh filled the Sabbath air of Dyersburg, Tenn.\nThousands of people witnessed this scene. They had to be pushed back from the stake to which the Negro was chained. Rooftops, second-story windows, and porch-tops were filled with spectators. Children were lifted to shoulders, that they might behold the agony of the victim.\nA little distance away, in the public square, the best citizens of the county supported the burning and torturing with their near-by presence.\nThe Memphis, Tenn., News-Scimitar says:\n\nNot a single cry for mercy was ever uttered by Scott. His fortitude struck even the mob workers as uncanny. No one offered a plea for the Negro after he confessed.\n\nNot a domino hid a face. Everyone was unmasked. Leaders were designated and assigned their parts. Long before the mob reached the city the public square was choked with humanity. All waited patiently, omen, with babies, made themselves comfortable.\n\nAt last the irons were hot.\n\nHave you anything to say?”\n\nA meek voice mumbled inaudibly. The Negro made a speech, but few caught the portent.\n\nA red streak shot out; a poker in a brawny hand was boring out one of the Negro’s eyes. The Negro bore the ordeal with courage, only low moans escaping him. Another poker was working like an auger on the other orbit.\n\nThe smell of burning flesh permeated the atmosphere, a pungent, sickening aroma telling those who failed to get good vantage points what their eyes could not see. Smoothing irons were searing the flesh.\n\nSwish. Once, twice, three times a red hot iron dug gaping places in Lation Scott’s back and sides.\n\nFetch a hotter one,” somebody said. The execution went on.\n\nNow someone had another poker—jabbing its fiery joint into the ribs of the doomed black.\n\nThen rubbish was piled high about the agonized body, squirming beneath its load.\n\nSomeone struck the match—they say the husband of the assaulted woman applied it—and smoke began to curl upward into a blue sky. The flames gathered momentum, engulfing the body. The fire seemed to groan, but it was Lation Scott.\n\nMore and more wood and rubbish were fed the fire, but at three o’clock Lation Scott was not dead. Life finally fled at four o’clock.\n\nThe executioners departed, leaving only the morbid. Women, who had left their dinners in the making, hastened home. Children, who had tarried on the way home from Sunday School, scurried away.\n\nWomen scarcely changed countenance as the Negro’s back was ironed with the hot brands. Even the executioners maintained their poise in the face of bloody creases left by the irons—irons which some housewife has been using.\n\nThree and a half hours were required to complete the execution."

    "text": "Dyersburg Sentiment\nPublic opinion in Dyersburg and Dyer County seems to be divided into two groups. One group considers that the Negro got what he deserved. The other group feels that he should have had a “decent lynching.” Numbers of prominent Dyersburg citizens are of this second group. They say they thought the Negro was going to be given a “decent lynching,” and that they consider the burning and torturing a disgrace to the community. By this is meant a quick, quiet hanging, with no display or torturing.\n\nDyersburg, Tenn.\nThe identity of the mob leaders is known all over Dyer County. From all accounts, they are citizens of doubtful reputation, backed up for this occasion by the sentiment of the community at large.\nA prosperous citizen made the remark that these men were no better than the Negro. He was threatened at once with lynching. This remark has, however, been made by others, as well as by the man threatened.\nStreet talk in Dyersburg on Monday had not yet been touched by reflection. One man, who had been out of town on Sunday, was heard to say with gusto: “The best part about it was the burning. This hanging kills too quick. If I’d been here I’d have helped.”\nAnother commented: “It was the biggest thing since Ringling Brothers’ Circus came to town.”\nA few people—mostly women—said: “It was terrible.”\nMany citizens seem to have the psychology of having performed an unpleasant duty. One citizen said: “People here can do a thing like that, and then forget all about it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSigns from the South (1919)\nScottsboro (1934)\nScottsboro (1933)\nThe Burning of Jim Mc Ilherron: An N.A.A.C.P.

    "text": "The most disquieting sign of my mounting years is a certain garrulity about myself, quite foreign to my young days. I find a growing tendency to fix innocent listeners with my stern eye, despite their all too evident longing to escape, and to tell them what life has meant to me. In this case I have been most easily persuaded that Crisis readers are more than anxious to know about me, simply because I am having a birthday. Selah!\nI was born by a golden river and in the shadow of two great hills, five years after the Emancipation Proclamation. The house was quaint, with clap-boards running up and down, neatly trimmed, and there were five rooms, a tiny porch, a rosy front yard, and unbelievably delicious strawberries in the rear. A South Carolinian owned all this—tall, thin, and black, with golden earrings, and given to religious trances. My own people were poor. I never remember being cold or hungry, but I do remember that shoes and coal and flour caused mother moments of anxious thought in winter; a new suit was an event.\nWe were part of a great clan. Full two hundred years before Tom Burghardt had come through the western pass to the Hudson with his Dutch captor, “Coenret Borghghardt,” sullen in his slavery and achieving his freedom by volunteering for the Revolution at a time of sudden alarm. His wife was a little black Bantu woman who never became reconciled to this strange land; she clasped her knees and rocked and crooned:\n\n\nDo bana coba—gene me!\n\nBen d’nuli, ben d’le⸺\n\nTom died about 1787, but of him came many sons and one, Jack, who helped in The War of 1812. Of Jack and his wife, Violet, was born a mighty family, splendidly named: Harlow and Ira, Cloe, Lucinda, Maria and Othello! I dimly remember my grandfather, Othello, or Uncle “Tallow,”—a brown man, strong-voiced and redolent with tobacco, who sat stiffly in a great high chair because his hip was broken. He was probably a bit lazy and given to wassail. At any rate, grandmother had a shrewish tongue and often berated him. mother was Sarah—“Aunt Sally”—a stern, tall, Dutch-African woman, beak-nosed but beautiful-eyed and golden skinned. Ten or more children were theirs, of whom the youngest was Mary, my mother.\nMother was dark shining bronze, with a tiny ripple in her black hair; black-eyed, with a heavy, kind face. She gave one the impression of infinite patience, but a curious determination was concealed in her softness. The family were small farmers on Egremont Plain, in Sheffield, and elsewhere, going out now and then to work as “help.” At about the time of my birth economic pressure was transmuting the family generally from farmers to “hired” help. Some revolted and migrated westward. Some went city-ward as cooks and barbers. Mother worked some years in service at Great Barrington, and after a disappointing love episode with a cousin, who went to California, she met and married Alfred DuBois and went to live by the golden river where I was born.\nAlfred, my father, must have seemed a splendid vision in that little valley under the shelter of those mighty hills. He was small and beautiful of face and feature, just tinted with the sun, his curly hair chiefly revealing his kinship to Africa. In nature he was a dreamer, romantic, indolent, kind, unreliable. He had in him the making of a poet, an adventurer, or a Beloved Vagabond, according to the life that closed round him. His father, Alexander DuBois, cloaked, under a stern austere demeanor, a passionate revolt against the world. He, too, was small, but squarish. I remember him as I saw him first in his home in New Bedford—white hair, close-cropped; a seamed, hard face, but high in tone, with a grey eye that could twinkle or glare.\nLong years before him Louis XIV drove two Huguenot cousins, Jacques and Pierre, into wild Ulster County, N.Y. One of them in the third or fourth generation had a descendant, Dr. James DuBois, a gay, rich bachelor who made his money in the Bahamas where he and the Gilberts had plantations. There he took a beautiful little mulatto slave as his mistress and two sons were born: Alexander in 1803, and John later. They were fine, straight, clean-eyed boys, white enough to “pass.” He brought them to America and put Alexander in the celebrated Cheshire School in Connecticut. Here he often visited him, but one last time fell dead. He left no will, and his relations made short shrift of these sons. They gathered in the property, apprenticed grandfather to a shoemaker; then dropped him.\nGrandfather took his bitter dose like a thoroughbred. Wild as was his inner revolt against this treatment, he uttered no word against the thieves and made no plea. He tried his fortunes here and in Hayti; he became eventually chief steward on the New York and New Haven boats, and later a small merchant in Springfield. Always he held his head high, took no insults, made few friends. He was not a “Negro,” he was a man! Yet when the white Episcopalians of Trinity Parish, New Haven, showed plainly that they did not want him or his folk, he led the revolt which resulted in St. Luke’s Parish, and was for years its senior warden. Beneath his sternness was a very human man. Slyly he wrote poetry. He loved much and married three wives, but he was hard and unsympathetic with his children. Some of them and their children are now “white,” but his oldest son quarrelled and ran away from home and married my brown mother.\nSo, with some circumstance, having finally gotten myself born, with a flood of Negro blood, a strain of French, a bit of Dutch, and thank God! no “Anglo-Saxon,” I come to the days of my childhood.\nThey were very happy. Early we moved back to grandfather’s home; I barely remember its stone fireplace, big kitchen, and delightful wood-shed. Then this house passed to other branches of the clan and we moved to rented quarters in town; to one delectable place “up stairs,” with a wide yard full of shrubbery, and a brook; to another house abutting a railroad, with infinite interests; and, finally, back to the quiet street on which I was born—down a long lane and in a homely, cozy cottage, with a living room, a tiny sitting room, a pantry, and two attic bed rooms. Here mother and I lived until she died in 1884; for father early began his restless wandering. I last remember urgent letters for us to come to New Milford where he had started a barber shop. Later he became a preacher. But mother no longer trusted his dreams and he soon faded out of our lives into silence.\nFrom the age of five until I was sixteen I went to school on the same grounds— down a lane, into a widened yard, with a big choke-cherry tree and two buildings, wood and brick. Here I got acquainted with my world and soon had my criterions of judgment. Wealth had no particular lure. We had in town no very rich, but many “well-to-do” folk. As playmate of the children I saw the homes of nearly all, except a few immigrant New Yorkers of whom none of us approved. The homes I saw impressed me but did not overwhelm me. Many were bigger than mine, with newer and shinier things, but they did not seem to differ in kind. I think I probably surprised my hosts more than they me, for I was easily at home and perfectly happy and they looked to me just like ordinary people, while my brown face and frizzled hair must have seemed strange to them.\nYet, I was very much one of them. I was a center and sometimes the leader of the town gang of boys. We were noisy but never very bad, and, indeed, my mother’s quiet influence came in here, as I realize now. She did not try to make me perfect. To her I was already perfect. She simply warned me of a few things, especially saloons. In my town the saloon was the open door to hell. The best families had their drunkards and the worst had little else.\nVery gradually I began to feel myself a part from my play fellows, with a special work, a special race. The realization came slowly—although at times there were sudden revelations. Curious enough, however, I always felt myself the superior, not the inferior, and any advantages which they had were, I was sure, quite accidental. I had only to mobilize my dreams—then they would see!\nI was graduated from the high school at sixteen. It was my first open triumph. I talked on “Wendell Phillips,” and all my town applauded with my mother. It was her great day, and after it she soon turned her face to the wall and slept. I was long in realizing my loss. That came many years after. Now it was the feel of wings. I was going beyond the hills, into the world which beckoned steadily.\nThere came a little pause. I wanted to go to Harvard, but white friends said I should go South, and they promised a scholarship. Very well, I was eager to see my people. They were yet strangers to me. So I embraced the opportunity, quite forgetting the curious irony by which I was not regarded as a real citizen of my birth town, with a future and a career, and went to a far land, among strangers who were regarded as (and in truth were) “mine own people.”\nAs I peer back through the shadow of my years, seeing not too clearly, but through the thickening veil of wish and afterthought, I seem to view my life divided into four distinct parts: the Age of Miracles, the Days of Disillusion, the Discipline of Work and Play, the Second Miracle Age.\nThe Age of Miracles began with Fisk and ended with Germany. I seemed to ride in conquering might. I was captain of my soul and master of Fate. I willed to do! It was. I wished and the wish came true. I suspect that beneath this triumph there were many failures and disappointments, but the realities loomed so large that they swept away even the memory of other dreams and wishes. Consider for a moment how miraculous it all was to a boy of seventeen, just escaped from a narrow valley: I willed, and lo! My people came dancing about me—riotous in color, gay in laughter, full of sympathy, need, and pleading; unbelievably beautiful girls—“colored” girls—sat beside me and actually talked to me while I gazed in tongue-tied silence, or babbled in boastful dreams. Boys with my own experiences wrought out with me great remedies. I studied eagerly under thoughtful teachers, and new worlds opened before me.\nI willed, and lo! I was walking beneath the elms of Harvard—the name of allurement, the college of my youngest, wildest visions; I needed money: scholarships and prizes fell into my lap; commencement came, and standing before Governor, President, and grave, gowned men, I told them certain astonishing truths, waving my arms and breathing fast. They applauded rapturously, and I walked home on great pink clouds of glory. I asked for a fellowship—and got it. I announced my plan of studying in Germany, and when the Slater Board excused itself, I went at them hammer and tongs. Ex-President Hayes, their chairman, smiled as he surrendered.\nI crossed the ocean in a trance; I saw London and Paris, Rome and Florence, Vienna and Berlin; I walked in valleys and climbed mountains; for the first time in my life I met real, human souls, face to face, and made friends. Distinctions of race and color faded. I felt myself just a man, not merely a “colored” man. I builded great castles in Spain, and lived therein. I dreamed and loved and wandered and sang; then I dropped suddenly back into “nigger”-hating America.\nMy Days of Disillusion were not disappointing enough to embitter me. I was still upheld by that fund of infinite faith, although dimly about me I saw the shadow of disaster. I began to realize how much of what I had called Will and Ability was sheer luck. Suppose my good mother had preferred a steady income from my child labor, rather than bank on the precarious dividend of my higher training? Suppose that pompous old village Judge, whose dignity we often ruffled and whose apples we stole, had had his way and sent me while a child to “reform” school to learn a “trade”? Suppose Principal Hosmer had been born with no faith in “darkeys,” and instead of giving me Greek and Latin had taught me carpentry and the making of tin pans? Suppose I had missed a Harvard scholarship? Suppose the Slater Board had had then, as now, distinct ideas as to where education of Negroes should stop? Suppose and suppose! As I sat down calmly on flat earth and looked at my life, a certain great Fear seized me. Was I the masterful captain, or the pawn of laughing sprites? I raise my hat to myself when I remember that even with these thoughts I did not hesitate or waver, but just went doggedly to work; and therein lay whatever salvation I have achieved.\nFirst came the task of earning a living. I was not nice or hard to please. I just got down on my knees and begged for work, anything and anywhere. I wrote to Hampton, Tuskegee, and a dozen other places. The trustees of a backwoods Tennessee town considered me, but were afraid.. Then, suddenly, Wilberforce offered to let me teach Latin and Greek at $750 a year. I was overjoyed! When offers from Tuskegee and Jefferson City followed, I refused; I was so thankful for that first offer.\nI went to Wilberforce with high ideals. I wanted to help to build a great university. I was willing, seriously willing, to work night as well as day. I taught Latin, Greek, English, and German. I helped in the discipline, took part in the social life, and begged to be allowed to lecture on sociology; and began to write books. But I found myself against a stone-wall. Nothing stirred before my impatient pounding. Or if it stirred, it soon slept again.\nFor the first time in my life I realized that there were limits to my will to do. The day of miracles was past, and a long, grey road of dogged work lay ahead. I had, in a sense, won, but could I remake Wilberforce? No. So I determined to leave Wilberforce and try elsewhere. Thus, the third period of my life began.\nFirst, in 1896, I married—a slip of a girl, beautifully dark-eyed and thorough and good as a German housewife. Then I accepted a job to make a study of Negroes in Philadelphia for the University of Pennsylvania—one year at six hundred dollars. How did I dare these two things? I do not know. Yet they spelled salvation. To remain at Wilberforce without doing my ideals meant spiritual death. Both I and my wife were homeless. I dared a home and a temporary job. But it was a different daring from the days of my first youth. I was ready to admit that the best of men might fail. I meant still to be captain of my soul, but I realized that even captains are not omnipotent in unchartered and angry seas.\nI essayed a thorough piece of work in Philadelphia. I labored morning, noon, and night. Nobody ever reads that fat volume on “The Philadelphia Negro,” but they treat it with respect, and that consoles me. The colored people of Philadelphia received me with no open arms. They had a natural dislike to being studied like a strange species. I met for the first time those curious cross currents and inner social whirlings of my own group. It set me to groping. I concluded that I did not know so much as I might about my own people, and when President Bumstead invited me to Atlanta University, the next year, to teach sociology and study the American Negro, I accepted gladly at a salary of twelve hundred dollars.\nMy real life work was done at Atlanta for thirteen years, from my twenty-ninth to my forty-second birthday. They were years of great spiritual upturning, of the making and unmaking of ideals, of hard work and hard play. Here I found myself. I lost most of my mannerisms. I became more broadly human, made my closest and most holy friendships, and studied human beings.\nI became widely acquainted with the real condition of my people. I realized the terrific odds which faced them. From captious criticism I changed to cold science; then to hot, indignant defense. I saw the race hatred of the whites, naked and unashamed. I held back more hardly each day the mounting indignation against injustice and misrepresentation. I faced with streaming eyes the awful paradox of death and birth—in fine, I emerged a man, scarred, partially disillusioned, and yet, grim with determination.\nAt last, forbear and waver as I would, I faced the great Decision. My life’s last and greatest door stood ajar. What with all my dreaming was I going to do in this fierce fight? Against all my natural reticence and hatred of forwardness, contrary to my dream of racial unity and my deep desire to serve and follow and think, rather than to lead and inspire and decide, I found myself suddenly the leader of a great wing of my people, fighting against another and greater wing. I hated the rôle. For the first time I faced criticism and cared. Every ideal and habit of my life was cruelly misjudged. I, who had always over-striven to give credit for good work, who had never consciously stooped to envy, was accused by honest colored people of every sort of small and petty jealousy; and white people said I was ashamed of my race and wanted to be white! I realized the real tragedy of life. The captivity of my soul was linked to the bloody and bowed head. Yet, there was no pomp of sacrifice, no place for appeal for sympathy. We simply had doggedly to insist, explain, fight and fight again until, at last, slowly, grudgingly we saw the world turn slightly to listen. My Age of Miracles returned again!\nMy cause grew, and with it I was pushed into a larger field. I felt more and more that Atlanta must stand well with philanthropists, while my larger duty was to speak clearly and forcefully for my people, despite powers and principalities. I was invited to come to New York and take charge of one part of a new organization. I came in 1910. It was an experiment. My salary even for a year was not assured, and I gave up a life position. I insisted on starting The Crisis as the main part of my work and this, after hesitation, was approved. The Crisis succeeded, and here I am on my fiftieth birthday.\nLast year, I looked death in the face and found its lineaments not unkind. But it was not my time. Yet, in nature sometime soon and in the fullness of days, I shall die; quietly, I trust, with my face turned South and Eastward; and dreaming or dreamless, I shall, I am sure, enjoy death as I have enjoyed life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe New Crisis (1925)\nFifteen Years (1924)\nWe Come of Age (1915)\nRadicals (1919)\nA Question of Policy and The Philosophy of Mr. Dole (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1918. “The Shadow of Years.”\nThe Crisis 15 (4): 167–71. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/15/04/shadow_of_years.html."

Church and the M. E. Church South, they are trying to get rid of 350,000 Negro members. Before the war the Methodists, by their meanness, drove a half million of their Negro members out into the wilderness, where they set up their own temples. Then repentant and remorseful, the church rose to its opportunity, damned slavery, spewed out the slave owners, and welcomed the slaves, even as their Master would have done.\nTo-day, the dry rot of power and numbers and prestige has seized them. In the name of Christian “unity,” Bishops and powerful laymen and strong periodicals are determined to kick 350,000 Negroes out of the church. Every other obstacle to union with the South is settled. Yet the secret conferences proceed. The oiliest of the church hypocrites, led by Zion’s Herald, are urging the black “brethren” to “withdraw” before they are thrown out, and offering them thirty pieces of silver in the guise of church property and bishops’ robes for their leaders.

He has not done everything we could wish, but he has accomplished so much more than President Wilson or any other member of this administration that he deserves all praise. He has carried out the draft with absolute fairness, notwithstanding delays. He has put black troops in nearly every cantonment. He has commissioned nearly 700 Negro officers in the United States Army. He has sent black troops to the front. He has made no discrimination in treatment or pay or opportunity. To be sure, we are segregated; but that was according to a foolish law for which the Secretary was not responsible. We are not permitted to volunteer beyond our four regiments but there, again, the authority of the Secretary is, at least, in doubt. Considering his limitations and the tremendous opposition to any act of justice to the Negro, Secretary Baker has done well. And he has crowned his well-doing by appointing an official advisor who belongs to the Negro race.\nThere remains one more thing for Secretary Baker to do. We have not yet our full quota of Negro officers. There were 86,300 Negroes called in the first draft. Allowing us no officers higher than captain, this would call for a thousand colored officers, and if we furnish 200,000 Negro troops in the second draft, as seems likely, we should have at least three thousand officers. We have at present seven hundred. We need a second officers’ training camp next January. We can furnish the men; will the Government furnish the instruction?

    "section": "",
    "text": "The primary cause of the Houston riot was the habitual brutality of the white police officers of Houston in their treatment of colored people. Contributing causes were (1) the mistake made in not arming members of the colored provost guard or military police, (2) lax discipline at Camp Logan which permitted promiscuous visiting at the camp and made drinking and immorality possible among the soldiers. Houston is a hustling and progressive southern city having the commission form of government and, as southern cities go, a fairly liberal one. Its population before the Negro exodus, which has doubtless decreased it by many thousands, was estimated at 150,000. Harris County, in which it is situated, has never had a lynching, and there are other indications, such as the comparative restraint and self-control of the white citizens after the riot, that the colored people perhaps enjoy a greater degree of freedom with less danger than in many parts of the South. It is, however, a southern city, and the presence of the Negro troops inevitably stirred its Negrophobe element to protest. There was some feeling against the troops being there at all, but I could not find that it was universal. Most of the white people seem to have wanted the financial advantages to be derived from having the camp in the neighborhood. The sentiment I heard expressed most frequently by them was that they were willing to endure the colored soldiers if they could be “controlled.” I was frequently told that Negroes in uniform were inevitably “insolent” and that members of the military police in particular were frequently “insolent” to the white police of Houston. It was almost universally conceded, however, that the members of the white police force habitually cursed, struck, and otherwise maltreated colored prisoners. One of the important results of the riot has been an attempt on the part of the Mayor and the Chief of Police of Houston to put a stop to this custom.\nIn deference to the southern feeling against the arming of Negroes and because of the expected co-operation of the city Police Department, members of the provost guard were not armed, thus creating a situation without precedent in the history of this guard. A few carried clubs, but none of them had guns, and most of them were without weapons of any kind. They were supposed to call on white police officers to make arrests. The feeling is strong among the colored people of Houston that this was the real cause of the riot. “You may have observed,” one of them said to me, “that Southerners do not like to fight Negroes on equal terms. This is at the back of all the southern feeling against Negro soldiers. If Corporal Baltimore had been armed, they would never have dared to set upon him and we should not have had a riot.” This was the general feeling I found among the colored people of Houston.\nSeveral minor encounters took place between the military and civil police shortly after the troops arrived. As a result, Chief of Police Brock issued an order calling on his men to co-operate with the military police, to give them full assistance, and to refer to them as “colored” and not as “nigger” officers. Chief Brock is a northern man and though apparently sincere and well-meaning, does not seem to have the full confidence of all his men for this and other reasons. The order was obeyed in a few instances and more often disregarded.\nOn the afternoon of August 23, two policemen, Lee Sparks and Rufe Daniels—the former known to the colored people as a brutal bully—entered the house of a respectable colored woman in an alleged search for a colored fugitive accused of crap-shooting. Failing to find him, they arrested the woman, striking and cursing her and forcing her out into the street only partly clad. While they were waiting for the patrol wagon a crowd gathered about the weeping woman who had become hysterical and was begging to know why she was being arrested. In this crowd was a colored soldier, Private Edwards. Edwards seems to have questioned the police officers or remonstrated with them. Accounts differ on this point, but they all agree that the officers immediately set upon him and beat him to the ground with the butts of their six-shooters, continuing to beat and kick him while he was on the ground, and arrested him. In the words of Sparks himself: “I beat that nigger until his heart got right. He was a good n when I got through with him.” Later Corporal Baltimore, a member of the military police, approached the officers and inquired for Edwards, as it was his duty to do. Sparks immediately opened fire, and Baltimore, being unarmed, fled with the two policemen in pursuit shooting as they ran. Baltimore entered a house in the neighborhood and hid under a bed. They followed, dragged him out, beat him up and arrested him. It was this outrage which infuriated the men of the 24th Infantry to the point of revolt. Following is the story of the arrest as given by its victim, Mrs. Travers, and by eyewitnesses whose names are in the possession of the Association, but are withheld for their protection.\nMrs. Travers, an evidently respectable, hardworking colored woman, said:\n\nI was in my house ironing. I got five children. I heard shooting and I’d run out in my yard to see what was happening. Sparks he came into my house and said, ‘Did you see a nigger jumping over that yard?’ and I said, ‘No, sir.’ He came in the house and looked all around. Went in back. Then Daniels, the other policeman, he came around the corner on his horse. I called to Mrs. Williams, my friend that lives across the street, and asked her what was the matter. She said, ‘I don’t know; I think they were shooting at crap-shooters.’\n\nHe (Sparks) came in again just then and said, ‘You’re a God damn liar; I shot down in the ground.’ I looked at her and she looked at me and he said, ‘You all God damn nigger bitches. Since these God damn sons of bitches of nigger soldiers come here you are trying to take the town.’ He came into the bedroom then and into the kitchen and I ask him what he want. He replied to me, ‘Don’t you ask an officer what he want in your house.’ He say, ‘I’m from Fort Ben and we don’t allow niggers to talk back to us. We generally whip them down there.’ Then he hauled off and slapped me. I hollered and the big one—this Daniels—he ran in, and then Sparks said to him, ‘I slapped her and what shall we do about it?’ Daniels says, ‘Take and give her ninety days on the Pea Farm ’cause she’s one of these biggety nigger women.’ Then they both took me by the arm and commenced dragging me out. I asked them to let me put some clothes on and Sparks says, ‘No, we’ll take you just as you are. If you was naked we’d take you.’ Then I take the baby in my arms and asked him to let me take it. He took it out of my arms and threw it down on the sidewalk. Took me with my arms behind my back and Daniels, he says, if I didn’t come he’d break them. They took me out on Tempson Street. He rung up the Police Department. Whilst I was standing crowd began a-coming (all I had on was this old dress-skirt and a pair panties and a ol’ raggedy waist. No shoes or nothing)—crowd and a colored soldier man came. [Private Edwards.] Sparks, he says to me, ‘YOU STAND HERE,’ and I did and a lady friend-brought me shoes and a bonnet and apron and he (Sparks) says, ‘Stay here,’ and went over, and before the soldier could say a word he said, ‘What you got to do with this,’ and he raised his six-shooter and he beat him—beat him good. He didn’t do a thing but just raise his hand to ward them off. Didn’t even tell them to quit, nor nothing. Then another soldier, this Sergeant Somebody, came, and the first one called to him and the policeman said to him, ‘If you come here, we’ll give you the same.’ Edwards said, ‘Must I go with them?’ and the second one says, ‘Yes, go with them and we’ll come along after you.’ I hear they shot that second soldier but I didn’t see it, for they took me away. They take me to the Police Department and locked me up for using ‘abusive language’—but they dismissed the case today.\n \nI ain’t never been before no court of inquiry, no ma’am. Only just to the court when they dismissed the case against me, and there ain’t no generals nor no one been out to see me or ask anything. I don’t know why they don’t come to me. They been to most everyone else around here, and I could tell them the truth. Seems like they might ask me, when I’m the one it happened to, and I’m not afraid to tell, even if Sparks do come back afterwards and do some more to me, but*you’re the only one yet that’s come to ask me.\n\nWhen interviewed a second time, Mrs. Travers added the following to her statement:\n\nI been down to the Prosecutor’s office today. He asked me what did I know about the riot. I said, ‘I don’t know nothing about it. I was in bed with my children when it happened. Where else would I be at that time of night?’ He said to me didn’t I know beforehand that the soldiers were coming; didn’t none of them tell me beforehand. I told him no, but I could tell him what happened before the riot to make it happen, and I started to tell him that Sparks came into my house and hit me. He say he didn’t want to hear anything more about that and he sent me home. That’s what I had to spend my carfare for.\n\nOne eye-witness said:\n\nI didn’t see them arrest Mrs. Travers. I don’t know what happened in the house, but I saw her afterwards and I know she said they slapped her in the house and pinched her arms and threw her baby under the bed. They had her right outside here waiting for the patrol wagon. She hadn’t on but two pieces of clothes—and she was hollering and asking what she’d done to be arrested. Then Private Edwards came up and asked if he could take her. I heard the policeman say, ‘Stand back,’ and landed him on the head with his six-shooter. Then Baltimore he came and asked him about the other soldier. They beat him, too, and he ran and they shot after him. I saw Sparks fire after him three times, myself. Daniels shot, too, but I don’t know if it was more than once. Baltimore ran away around the corner, with them firing after him, and his head was bloody. I thought he’d drop any time, but he didn’t get hit. They said afterward they fired at the ground—but they didn’t. They shot right straight at him and (they fired) into a street full of women and children. They haven’t found any bullet holes in the sidewalk either, and it wasn’t there that they fired. It was at Baltimore, and no mistake.\n\nA second eye-witness said:\n\nI drive a butcher wagon. I make deliveries all about here and I saw a lot of what happened about here before the riot. When Sparks and Daniels came along that day I was driving past where three boys were shooting craps at the corner of Felipe and Bailey Streets. They fired a shot to scare the boys and they ran. Then the officers couldn’t locate them. When I rode by again they had this woman, whose arrest was the cause of the riot, by the patrol box. She was insufficiently dressed to be out on the street and barefoot. There was a young soldier there (Private Edwards) who came up and asked the officers to let her put on shoes and clothes. The officers struck at him with their six-shooters. He put up his hand and blocked the first blow. The second hit him on the head and made him bloody. They followed that up and beat him to the ground. When he was down, one of them took the muzzle of his gun and punched him in the side, and Sparks said, ‘That’s the way we do things in the South. We’re running things not the d— niggers.’\n\nIt was later—at the same spot—the policemen were still there when the military officer (Baltimore) came. I didn’t hear what he said, but whatever was said between him and the police officers made him stop about half a block away and fold his arms, and at that one of the officers took out his revolver and commenced firing at him—right at him. He ran away around the corner of Mr. May’s place. That’s all I saw then.\n\nWhen word of the outrage reached camp, feeling ran high. It was by no means the first incident of the kind that had occurred. A few days before a Negro had been beaten on a car by city detective Ed Stoermer, who, according to his own testimony before the Citizens Investigating Committee, cleared the car of its white passengers, telling them that he “might have to kill the nigger.” I was reliably informed that on another occasion two colored soldiers were brutally beaten up by city detectives who boarded the car in which they sat from a Ford machine; that this machine drew up alongside of the car which was halted by the conductor long enough for the beating to take place, after which the detectives again got into the car and drove off.\nBaltimore was popular among the men of the 24th Infantry, and for some time the rumor persisted that he had been killed. To quell the excitement Major Snow telephoned in to Police Headquarters to ascertain the facts and asked that Baltimore be returned to the camp immediately. At roll call that evening Snow addressed the men, telling them what had happened and stating that Sparks was to blame and would be punished. The men, however, were by that time beyond his control. In this connection it has been pointed out several times that Sparks has been suspended and is under indictment for the assault on Baltimore and for murder for the shooting of another Negro. There is no reason to believe that this indictment is anything but a bluff, the purpose of which is to show that there was no excuse for the soldiers taking the law into their hands. Chief Brock, who throughout has given evidence of good faith, did his duty in suspending Sparks, but there is no reason to believe that Sparks will receive any punishment at the hands of a white jury, and if he is acquitted, he probably cannot be kept off the police force. “Of course, Sparks will be let off with a fine. Our policemen have to beat the niggers when they are insolent. You can’t expect them to let a nigger curse them,” one white man told me. The same man, in reply to my question whether Sparks did not have a reputation as a bully, replied, “Oh, no; at least only among the colered people.” The feeling of the colored people in regard to Sparks and the police in general is best illustrated by the statement of another colored man whose name I was unable to learn:\n\nIt’s like this, lady—l could talk all right, but I’m afeard. I know a lot, but I live here, and my family lives here, and all I got—all my savings of a lifetime is here—and there’s prejudice here—and you see how ’tis. I made up my mind—I took like an oath to myself I wouldn’t say nothing. I just made up my mind that I didn’t know nothing. Only that my friend here says you’re all right, I wouldn’t say this much—but I got confidence in him.\n\nThere’s been a lot of dirty work here. I’m not saying nothing, but you find out who it was killed that colored man who was drafted into the army on Washington Street, and who shot that colored man, Williams, in the back, they say was killed in a crap game on Dallas Avenue. They can’t find out that no one did it—but we know Sparks was in the gang that did the shooting. And that soldier man—the police shot him running—I saw him and he was hit in the back of the neck. And, what’s more, I’ve seen three more colored men beat up without any cause by the police since the riot. There’s a lot more I could say, only I’m afeard.\n\nIt is the Negro mentioned in this statement, Williams, for whose murder Sparks has been indicted. While I was in Houston the other Negro fugitive mentioned, who turned out to be an enlisted man under the selective draft law, was shot by a city detective simply for refusing to halt. The detective was “amicably” arrested by the Chief of Detectives and almost immediately released on a five hundred dollar bond. Sparks is also at liberty and although without the prestige given him by his position on the police force, was, at last report, using that liberty to further molest the colored people. About a week after the riot he entered the house of a respectable colored physician on Robbin Avenue early in the morning while the latter was in his bath and his wife partly dressed, on the pretext of looking for a fugitive, insulted and bullied them both when they protested, and threatened them with a drawn gun. On the same day he threatened a colored woman that he would “blow her damned head off” because he thought she had laughed at him. It was in pursuit of this woman that he entered several colored houses in this block, threatening and cursing the colored people.\nWhen investigation made it apparent that the police were to blame for the beginning of the riot, a systematic attempt was made to shift the blame for this also on to the colored people. Strange stories began to be circulated in the papers and by word of mouth as to the real cause of the friction between the soldiers and the police. It was again the insolence of the Negro soldiers which in this case took the form of ignoring the “Jim Crow” regulations of Houston, particularly on the Houston Street cars. Testimony to this effect, which was obviously absurd, was given and reported apparently in all seriousness before the Citizen’s Board of Inquiry. Several motormen and conductors were subpoenaed to testify to this effect, and one of them told a pathetic story of one occasion on which his car was boarded by a number of Negro soldiers (unarmed) who threw the “Jim Crow” screen out of the car window, over ran the car, forcing white passengers to get up and give them their seats, and who escaped unscathed to tell the tale. He was unable to give the names of any witnesses to this occurrence, although he stated that many of the white passengers left the car in great anger threatening that he would be reported and lose his job. The legend continued to the effect that white police officers were finally called in to deal with the Negro soldiers who were terrorizing the peaceable white citizens and demoralizing colored civilians, and that the former by merely doing their duty won the undying enmity of the colored soldiers.\nAnother outrageously false impression which was deliberately given by the white press was that Mrs. Travers was a woman of the underworld and that her arrest was the result of drunken and disorderly conduct. Mrs. Travers is unmistakably a hardworking, respectable woman. She had no connection with either Edwards or Baltimore, whom she had never seen before the day of the riot. The story, however, was never denied, and was still being circulated while I was in Houston, although so many white people who had employed her testified to her good character that it was necessary to acquit her at her trial for “using abusive language.” She was also never called before the Citizen’s Board of Inquiry.\nPolice brutality and bad discipline among the soldiers led up to the riot, which cost the city of Houston eighteen lives. Among them was that of Daniels, the policeman who had taken part in the beating of Baltimore and Edwards. There is abundant testimony from both white and colored people that there was excessive drinking and immorality among the soldiers at the camp, and there is testimony by white people to the effect that Edwards was drunk when he was arrested. While this may have been the case, it does not seem to materially effect the situation, as Baltimore, who was sober, received even worse treatment at the hands of the police officers. It is also very probable that some of the leaders were inflamed with drink at the time of the outbreak. That outbreak, according to a statement made by Major Snow before he received orders not to talk, was not an out and out mutiny, although the men were undoubtedly guilty of repeated disobedience to orders before they left the camp. If they did, as is alleged, shoot at their officers, they did not kill or wound any of them, though they did wound a colored soldier who was guarding the ammunition supply and who later died of his wounds. When the soldiers left the camp their slogan was, “On to the Police Station,” where their idea was to punish the police for their attack on Edwards and Baltimore. Even the white people of Houston do not believe that their original intention was to shoot up the town. When on the way to the police station they met with opposition, they gave battle with terrible results. As in every riot, innocent bystanders were killed, one very pathetic case being that of a little white girl who was killed by a stray bullet which penetrated the room where she slept. The bitterness of the white people over this and other casualties is understandable, but the worst features of the Houston riot do not for one moment make it comparable with the massacre of East St. Louis. It was not a cold-blooded slaughter of innocents but the work of angry men whose endurance of wrong and injustice had been strained to the breaking point, and who in their turn committed injustices. There was no burning of women and children, no hanging, no torturing of innocent victims. The only atrocity reported being the bayoneting of Captain Mattes of the Illinois National Guard, spoken of by the Houston papers as the work of “black fiends,” although bayoneting is not a practice discouraged by the United States Army.\nAll the men who are alleged to have taken part in the outbreak have been captured and are facing a court martial at El Paso. The one fact which admits of no uncertainty is that if they are found guilty they will be fully and sufficiently punished.\nAfter the riot the white citizens of Houston behaved with unusual coolness and restraint and they have taken unto themselves full credit for so doing. The presence of United States troops undoubtedly assisted materially in keeping order. A half hour after the riot started Governor Ferguson had declared martial law which lasted for several days and order was restored without any lynching or other form of reprisal on the part of the white people. It was not to be expected that martial law or any other kind of law could be enforced impartially under the circumstances, and it was not so enforced. White citizens were given arms “to protect their homes” and the homes of Negro civilians were visited and their arms taken away from them. Many Negroes were also unjustly arrested, locked up for several days, and then dismissed without any charge having been made against them. That further disorder did not occur under such circumstances is one of the most remarkable things about the situation, and credit for it should be given to both races. The Houston Post and the white people generally explained it as another illustration of the well-known fact that “the South is the Negro’s best friend”; that race riot and bloodshed are really indigenous to northern soil; and that the relations between black and white in the South are highly cordial. The colored people of Houston, however, are migrating North, and to this more than to any element in the case I attribute the new restraint in the attitude of white Houstonians. While I was in Houston, 130 colored people left in one day. In June, one labor agent exported more than nine hundred Negroes to points along the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Houston Chamber of Commerce became so alarmed over the Negro exodus that it telegraphed to the head of the railroad asking that this exportation be discontinued. The railroad complied with this request, but the colored people continued to leave. Colored men and women in every walk of life are still selling their homes and household goods at a loss and leaving because, as one of them, a physician, put it to me, “Having a home is all right, but not when you never know when you leave it in the morning if you will really be able to get back to it that night.” White Houston, especially its business men, are beginning to realize this. For the first time they are showing some slight signs of seeking to make the South safe for the Negro. While the northern exodus of the Negroes, which began with the war, is largely responsible for this, occurrences such as the Houston riot must be admitted to quicken the sense of justice which has so long lain dormant in the white southern breast. However much the riot is to be condemned from the standpoint of justice, humanity, and military discipline, however badly it may be held to have stained the long and honorable record of Negro soldiers, however necessary it may be that the soldiers should be severely punished, it seems to me an undeniable fact that one of its results will be a new respect and consideration for the Negro in the South.\n\nCitation: Gruening, Martha. 1918. “Houston: An N.A.A.C.P.

    "text": "Some 75,000 Negro voters in the State of New York will be asked to decide this month as to whether or not they are willing that women should have the vote in this State. It is an unpleas­ant but well-known fact that hither­ to American Negro voters have, in the majority of cases, not been favor able to woman suffrage. This attitude has been taken for two main reasons: First, the Negro, still imbued by the ideals of a past genera­tion, does not realize the new status of women in industrial and social life. Despite the fact that within his own­ group women are achieving economic independence even faster than whites, he thinks of these as excep­tional and abnormal and looks for­ ward to the time when his wages will be large enough to support his wife and daughters in comparative idleness at home.\nSecondly, the American Negro is particularly bitter at the attitude of many white women: at the naive assumption that the height of his am­bition is to marry them, at their arti­ficially-inspired fear of every dark face, which leads to frightful accusa­tions and suspicions, and at their sometimes insulting behavior toward him in public places.\nNotwithstanding the undoubted weight of these two reasons, the American Negro must remember, First, that the day when women can be considered as the mere appendages of men, dependent upon their bounty and educated chiefly for their pleasure, has gone by; that as an in­telligent, self-supporting human be­ing a woman has just as good a right to a voice in her own government as has any man; and that the denial of this right is as unjust as is the denial of the right to vote to American Negroes.\nSecondly, two wrongs never made a right. We cannot punish the insolence of certain classes of American white women or correct their ridicu­lous fears by denying them their un­ doubted rights.\nIt goes without saying that the women’s vote, particularly in the South, will be cast almost unanimously, at first, for every reactionary Negro-hating piece of legislation that is proposed; that the Bourbons and the demagogs, who are today sitting in the Natural Legislature by the reason of stolen votes, will have additional backing for some years from the votes of white women.\nBut against this consideration it must be remembered that these same women are going to learn political justice a great deal more quickly than did their men and that despite their prejudices their very emergence into the real, hard facts of life and out of the silly fairy-land to which their Southern male masters beguile them is going to teach them sense in time.\nMoreover, it is going to be more difficult to disfranchise colored women in the South than it was to disfranchise colored men. Even southern “gentlemen,” as used as they are to the mistreatment of colored wom­en, cannot in the blaze of present publicity physically beat them away from the polls. Their economic power over them will be smaller than their power over the men and while you can still bribe some pauperized Negro laborers with a few dollars at election time, you cannot bribe Negro women.\nIt is, therefore, of the utmost importance that every single black voter in the State of New York should this month cast his ballot in favor of woman suffrage and that every black voter in the United States should do the same thing whenever and as often as he has opportunity.\nIt is only in such broad-minded willingness to do justice to all, that the black man can prove his right not only to share, but to help direct modern culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nVotes (1919)\nOhio (1912)\nWoman Suffrage (1915)\nThe Woman Voter (1921)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1918. “Votes for Women.”\nThe Crisis 15 (1): 8. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/15/01/votes_for_women.html."

    "text": "The death of Hollis Burke Frissell, principal of Hampton Institute, brings that institution and its work prominently before the public. It is, therefore, peculiarly fitting that the following correspondence should be made public:\n\nDear Dr. Du Bois:\n\nIn preparation for the Fiftieth Anniversary of Hampton Institute, efforts are being made to collect the necessary material for the history of the school. It is a matter of history that for many years the colored people were opposed to the type of education offered them at Hampton and were consequently also opposed to the school itself. For the sake of learning the facts in regard to this matter I am writing to you and to a number of other prominent colored men to ask for statements in regard to the facts in the case.\n\nI shall be very grateful if you will send me a statement in regard to the attitude (with reasons) of the colored people who were opposed to industrial education during the early days of Hampton and who are still in some cases opposed to it.\n\nWill you kindly say in this connection whether you will object to the use of your name, if that is thought desirable? * * *\n\n(Miss) J. E. DAVIS.\n\nDear Miss Davis:\nI have a wide acquaintance with educated colored folk. My interpretation of their attitude is that they do not oppose and never have opposed Hampton Institute because it teaches industries. On the contrary they recognize Hampton as probably the best center of trade-teaching for Negroes in the United States.\nIt is true, however, that educated Negroes in the past and at present hold Hampton and some of her methods in grave distrust. They recognize the worth of her work—the fine spirit of many of her teachers, past and present, and the splendid character of her graduates, but at the same time, they cannot forget three important facts:\n\nThe course of study at Hampton is so arranged that it cannot be made to fit in with the higher courses of education, as adopted by the leading educational institutions of the United States. Granted that Hampton is and ought to be the finishing school for nine-tenths of her students, the fact remains that Hampton deliberately makes it impossible for her most promising and brilliant students to receive college training or higher technical and professional training, save at great disadvantage and a wellnigh fatal loss of time. Friends of Hampton have defended this action by asserting (a) that the Negro does not need college training and (b) that if the colleges do not fit the Hampton course of study, they are wrong and not Hampton. Both these assertions educated Negroes regard as preposterous. There are hundreds of Hampton men who deserve and could efficiently use longer and more thorough courses of training than Hampton gives, but who find themselves at the age of nineteen or twenty in an educational blind alley, with further progress barred. They must go out as half-educated, partially-trained men, when they might be developed to full efficiency. It is, undoubtedly, true that colleges ought to recognize a broader fitting-school course of study than they do at present, but so long as they do not, it is criminal to make the Negro the peculiar sufferer from their exclusiveness and to deny the undoubted value of the present college curriculum to the finest Negro minds in Virginia. \nIt may be said that Hampton simply specializes on technical training and high school work and that students fitted for higher training can go elsewhere. This brings us to the second indictment against Hampton—her illiberal and seemingly selfish attitude toward other colored schools. She holds little or no fellowship with them; she has repeatedly loaned herself to decrying their work, criticizing and belittling their ideals while her friends continually seek to divert to Hampton the already painfully meager revenues of the colored colleges. Few schools can equal in its own field the efficiency of Hampton, with its millions of endowment, but certainly the splendid work of Atlanta, Fisk, Howard, and other schools, done in poverty and travail and in the face of hostile public opinion, deserves better recognition and less criticism than it gets from Hampton and her friends.  Moreover, the students who go to Hampton go for “education.” They do not know their own bent and aptitudes. They come from homes where they can hope for little educational guidance. It should be the work of Hampton not simply to train but to sift and to send to colleges or other schools those fitted for work higher or different from that offered by her curriculum. This she never voluntarily does. She feeds no colleges or professional schools; she encourages no artists or musicians; she helps no writers, but apparently proceeds on the assumption that every Negro must be trained to farm, or to be an artisan or a servant. We have no silly illusions as to the number of talented Negroes who deserve higher training, but surely in fifty years it seems that out of tens of thousands of students Hampton might have found a few worthy of the highest training. Small wonder that educated Negroes resent this and demand that Hampton cease to bury talent and deflect genius.  \nThe third indictment of educated Black Folk against Hampton is more difficult to express than the others, and one of which we are less sure, and yet it is a real grievance in our minds. We believe that an institution that professes to teach the Negro self-respect and self-control should give the Negro a larger voice in her government. We do not wish Hampton to be an exclusively Negro institution, but we do think that there should be Negroes on her Board of Trustees; that there should be a larger recognition of Negro achievement, instead of an almost exclusive emphasis of the white philanthropists; and that there should be a closer touch between the school and the body of educated Negro opinion. In fine, we think that Hampton should consider what we want and not simply what she wishes us to want. We do not feel, at present, that Hampton is our school—on the contrary, we feel that she belongs to the white South and to the reactionary North, and we fear that she is a center of that underground and silent intrigue which is determined to perpetuate the American Negro as a docile peasant and peon, without political rights or social standing, working for little wage, and heaping up dividends to be doled out in future charity to his children.\n\nSuch a feeling as this may be wrong and ill-founded, but it is real and it easily lies within Hampton’s power to disprove it.\nThese are the reasons why many educated Negroes are and have been “opposed” to Hampton. We have seldom voiced this opposition, and I voice it now only at your invitation.\nI reiterate my respect for the Institution and my firm belief that it has done great good, but I insist that no school which deliberately curtails the training of the talented, refuses to guide her apter students to their greatest development, save in restricted lines, and not only gives her beneficiaries little or no voice in its control, but seems even to harbor and encourage their enemies—no such school is reaching its greatest usefulness.\nW.

    "text": "Field Artillery has become a highly specialized instrument of great precision. Front line trenches are frequently less than a hundred yards apart and nothing discourages your own infantry more than to receive a shell that was intended for the next trench. When the men of the 92nd Division go “over the top” they will frequently follow an accompanying barrage as close as a hundred yards.\nNow that “curtain of fire” behind which colored soldiers will move to the assault of brutal German lines will be laid down by the first field guns ever manned by colored American soldiers. Every Negro in the United States is deeply interested in seeing that the artillery of the 92nd Division becomes as efficient an organization as the Tenth Cavalry, for instance, of which every colored American is justly proud.\nThe 167th Field Artillery Brigade is tremendously handicapped today because the draft has failed to bring in a sufficient number of educated and technically trained men to fill the special details and assume the responsibilities of Non-Commissioned Officers. The Commanding General of the Artillery Brigade desires at once to secure the following specialists:\n\nForty-four Telephone men who have had experience at installing and operating telephones, with a knowledge of elementary electricity.\nSixty-one Instrument men with at least a high school education. They will be trained to use the Battery Commander’s telescope, aiming circle, range finder, and other instruments similar to surveyors’ and engineers’ instruments. Civil engineers are particularly desired for this work.\nForty-four Scouts, high school graduates, if possible, who have had some instruction in drafting and mapping and can learn to do reconnaissance work.\nForty-six Typists and 12 Stenographers to do clerical work in Brigade and Regimental headquarters, and Battery offices.\nThirty-one Mechanics who can keep the guns and motors in repair, men with experience as machinists or millwrights.\nEighteen Saddlers to repair harness and saddles.\nForty-seven Horse-shoers.\nTen Radio or Telegraph Operators.\nThree hundred and twenty-three men of good education and mature years who can work into the responsible positions of First Sergeants, Mess Sergeants, Supply Sergeants, Sergeants, and Corporals.\n\nTo all of the above who prove competent, positions are open carrying the rank or the pay of Non-Commissioned Officers: $36-$38 a month and support.\nIn addition there are needed: * Forty Hospital attendants, men having a knowledge of first aid or previous hospital experience. * Thirteen Truck drivers who understand automobile repairs.\nCommanding General,\n167th Field Artillery Brigade,\n92nd Division,\nCamp Dix, New Jersey\nstating age, education, and experience in the class applied for.

    "text": "Hear ye, hear ye! Men of all the Americas, and listen to the tale of the Eldest and Strongest of the Races of men whose faces be Black. Hear ye, hear ye! For lo! Upon this night a world shall pass before your souls, bathed in color, wound with song and set to the dancing of a thousand feet. And this shall be the message of this pageantry: Of the Black man’s Gift of Iron to the world; of Ethiopia and her Glory; of the Valley of Humiliation through which God would she pass and of the Vision Everlasting when the Cross of Christ and the Star of Freedom set atop the Pillar of Eternal Light. Men of the world keep silence and in reverence see this holy thing.\n\nThis has been the opening cry of the dark and crimson-turbaned Herald in three presentations of the pageant, “The Star of Ethiopia,” given by colored people in New York, Washington and Philadelphia before audiences aggregating nearly 35,000 people.\nThe last of these three pageants was given in Philadelphia during the month of May before audiences of eight thousand. It was in many respects the most perfect of the pageants. For while it lacked the curious thrill and newness of the New York production and the mysterious glamour of shadow, star and sky which made the Washington pageant unforgettable, yet Philadelphia in its smoothness and finish was technically the best. As this last production represents possibly the end of the series it is a fitting time to review this effort.\nThe Negro is essentially dramatic. His greatest gift to the world has been and will be a gift of art, of appreciation and realization of beauty. Such was his gift to Egypt, even as the dark Herald cried in the second scene of the pageant:\n\nHear ye, hear ye! All them that come to know the truth and listen to the tale of the Wisest and Gentlest of the Races of Men whose faces be Black. Hear ye, hear ye! And learn the ancient Glory of Ethiopia, All-Mother of men, whose wonders men forgot. See how beneath the Mountains of the Moon, alike in the Valley of Father Nile and in ancient Negro-land and Atlantis the Black Race ruled and strove and fought and sought the Star of Faith and Freedom even as other races did and do. Fathers of Men and Sires of Children golden, black and brown, keep silence and hear this mighty word.\n\nAll through Africa pageantry and dramatic recital is close mingled with religious rites and in America the “Shout” of the church revival is in its essential pure drama. The American Negro early turned toward the theatre. Ira Aldridge, their first great actor, was born in Maryland in 1810 and educated in Glasgow. He became before his death the first of European tragedians, honored and decorated by nearly every European government. There was, of course, no career for him in America. Here by the unbending law of exclusion Negro minstrelsy developed first with white men and then with colored actors.\nIn later days Cole and Johnson and Williams and Walker lifted minstrelsy by sheer force of genius into the beginning of a new drama. White people refused to support the finest of their new conceptions like the “Red Moon” and the cycle apparently stopped. Recently, however, with the growth of a considerable number of colored theatres and moving picture places, a new and inner demand for Negro drama has arisen which is only partially satisfied by the vaudeville actors. Today in Harlem it is being curiously supplied by setting companies of colored actors to playing recent Broadway successes like “Alias Jimmy Valentine,” “Today” and “The Escape.” The next step will undoubtedly be the slow growth of a new folk drama built around the actual experience of Negro American life.\nAlready there are beginnings here and there, but especially in Washington, where Nathaniel Guy and Laura Bruce Glenn have been at work, and last year produced Angelina Grimke’s strong play, “Rachel.”\nI seemed to see this development some years ago, and as a kind of beginning I sketched the pageant, the “Star of Ethiopia,” in 1911. It was not staged until 1913 at the Emancipation Exposition in New York City. There it was made a part of the Exposition and attempted with three hundred and fifty colored actors. I can feel again the strain of that first attempt and the sound of the voice of the Herald crying:\n\nHear ye, hear ye! Eternal Children of the Lord, ye little ones within whose veins the blood of Ethiopia flows and flames. Hear ye, hear ye! And listen to the tale of the Humblest and Mightiest of the Races of Men whose faces be Black. Behold the Star of Faith so nearly lost, yet found again and placed against high heaven through the crucifixion of God and little children. Sons and Daughters of Men keep silence and hear this beautiful thing.\n\nThis first pageant was in audience and acting a great success, “An impressive spectacle,” as the Outlook said, “both from a historical point of view and as a forecast.”\nThen came my dream. It seemed to me that it might be possible with such a demonstration to get people interested in this development of Negro drama to teach on the one hand the colored people themselves the meaning of their history and their rich, emotional life through a new theatre, and on the other, to reveal the Negro to the white world as a human, feeling thing.\nI started out to raise three thousand dollars. By contributing five hundred myself and by the wonderful gift of one young woman I succeeded in raising a little over two thousand dollars in cash; my other pledges failed. With this money the Washington pageant was given in the open air with twelve hundred colored participants. It was a wonderful thing. As one white woman wrote: “It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in Washington.” And the President of the Board of Education declared it “A remarkable spectacle of great educational value.”\nBut with all this it was financially a partial failure and I found myself at the end with my capital reduced one-half. Yet I looked upon it simply as a certain, mild Valley of Humiliation repeating to myself the words of the Herald at the beginning of the fourth scene:\n\nHear ye, hear ye! All ye that come to see the light and listen to the tale of the Bravest and Truest of the Races of Men whose faces be Black! Hear ye, hear ye! And learn how men of Negro blood did suffer the Pains of Death and the Humiliation of Hell, yet did not die. Listen, Mothers of Men and Daughters of Almighty God beneath whose hearts these dark and beautiful children lie and have lain buried—listen and hear this awful thing.\n\nI determined to make one more effort at Philadelphia. Here in celebration of the One Hundredth General Conference of the African M. E. Church the pageant was given the third and perhaps the last time with one thousand and seventy-eight colored actors. It was to all who saw it a Vision Everlasting like to the Herald’s cry before the impressive scene:\n\nHear ye, hear ye! All them that dwell by the Rivers of Waters and in the beautiful, the Valley of Shadows, and listen to the ending of this tale. Learn, Sisters and Brothers, how above the Fear of God, Labor doth build on Knowledge; how Justice tempers Science and how Beauty shall be crowned in Love beneath the Cross. Listen, O Isles, for all the pageant returns in dance and song to build this Tower of Eternal Light beneath the Star. Keep silence and let your souls sing with this last and latest word.\n\n“It was,” says the Friend’s Intelligencer, “a signal contribution to the fine art of pageantry.” A white woman writes: “The conception is so noble and the dramatic rendering fine and forceful, and all in exquisite taste and great refinement. There was such freedom from self-consciousness in the actors that it seemed as though they were only doing what they were born to do.” The North American said it was “cleverly” done. The Record noted “many brilliant and colorful scenes,” and a writer in the Public Ledger says: “The intelligent interpretation which the thousand actors in the pageant gave of the author’s thought was proof in itself that the Negro is not the mentally torpid individual that prejudiced white folks persist in considering him.” A settlement worker wrote: “I wish I could find the words I need to thank you for the beautiful thing you have given us in the pageant, but perhaps my best tribute is the very wordlessness, tear-salted eyes with which I watched it, and shall a*ways remember it. It was not only the pathos and the tragedy of the story that made the tears and the wordlessness, something deeper than that.\n“In spite of the hurt, you’ll keep right on being a poet, won’t you, please?”\nAnd so it ended beautifully and full of satisfaction, due in greatest measure to the genius and devotion of Charles Burroughs, Dora Cole Norman, Richard Brown and Augustus Dill, my chief helpers, and to hundreds of others. And yet, alas, the whole of my little capital is swept away except a thousand dollars inextricably tied up in costumes and properties. What now is the next step? Already there are faint signs: A Shakespeare pageant in Washington and two masques in Cincinnati. Numerous inquiries from elsewhere have come.\nThe great fact has been demonstrated that pageantry among colored people is not only possible, but in many ways of unsurpassed beauty and can be made a means of uplift and education and the beginning of a folk drama. On the other hand, the white public has shown little or no interest in the movement. The American Pageant Association has been silent, if not actually contemptuous, and there have been within my own race the usual petty but hurting insinuations of personal greed and selfishness as the real incentives behind my efforts. Unless, therefore, from unforeseen and at present unknown sources I receive help and encouragement I shall lay this effort down and bequeath to new hands crying with the last cry of my Herald:\n\nHear ye, hear ye! All them that sing before the Lord and forget not the Vision of the Eldest and Strongest of the Races of Men whose faces be Black. Hear ye, hear ye! And remember forever and one day the Star of Ethiopia, All-Mother of Men, who gave the world the Iron Gift and Gift of Faith, the Pain of Humility «nd Sorrow Song of Pain, and Freedom, Eternal Freedom, underneath the Star. Arise and go, Children of Philadelphia—the Play is done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe People of Peoples and Their Gifts to Men (1913)\nThe Quadroon (1911)\nThe Burden of Black Women (1914)\nUnrest (1920)\n‘Krigwa Players Little Negro Theatre’ (1926)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “The Drama Among Black Folk.”\nThe Crisis 12 (4): 169–73. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/12/03/drama_among_black_folk.html."

Any actor is pleased when the responsiveness of his audience shows him he has got his lines “across,” but the most frenzied Othello can hardly conceal his bewilderment when his attempt Desdemona provokes to strangle shouts of merriment.\nIs this state of affairs due to ignorance or thoughtlessness? To a combination of both, I fancy. We cannot afford either. It is true one goes to the theater to be amused, in any event to be diverted, but the establishment and maintenance of the colored theater and the colored actor have at this point of our development a peculiar, though obvious significance. Our actors must be encouraged and not put on a level with mountebanks whose slightest gesture is the signal for laughter. There is no truer encouragement than an intelligent appreciation.

The fact of the matter is that Boston is more law-abiding, and that an accused black man there even in the midst of a mob can appeal to law- abiding bystanders and receive protection. In South Carolina the well- known innocence of a black man could only in exceptional cases appeal to the white bystander. The Atlanta, Ga. Constitution assumes that the appointment of Miss Bosfield to a position among white clerks in a hospital in Massachusetts was something exceptional ard that they revolted against it just as Georgia would have. This is untrue and the Constitution probably knows that it is. There are dozens of colored clerks, male and female, working with their white fellows in all parts of Massachusetts. Just as long as the South receives from its daily press the silly impression that other parts of the world are as crazy and unreasonable in their racial hatreds as are the southern United States, just so long there will be no appeal to reason in those half civilized districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAnarchism (1912)\nScottsboro (1933)\nA Moral Void (1917)\nLynchings and Mobs (1921)\nThe Old Story (1911)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Deception.” The Crisis 12\n(2): 81–82. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/12/02/deception.html."

The cause of the difficulties in Reconstruction was the determination of the white South to re-enslave Negroes, and the determination of the Negroes to be really free.\nThe writer goes on to say that the late Booker T. Washington believed that “the only social intimacy the Negro required was that open to him among his own people.” This is not true. No American Negro ever accepted so much social recognition as Mr. Washington. He dined with white men and women, he sat in the parlors of his white friends, he was entertained at their homes, he met and conferred with them on all possible social occasions. Why did he do this? Because he craved their company? No. He did it for the reason given by the late Justice Lamar of the United States Supreme Court, a Mississippian and a Confederate: Justice Lamar, in a speech made several years before his appointment to the bench, in speaking of the Negro problem, said: “He can only be elevated by education — not the mere education of books, but the education that comes from contact with the ‘superior mind’.” Wherever that “superior mind” is found the Negro will be found. Sometimes it is found in a white skin; sometimes it is found in a black skin; but any social life which tries to forbid common contact of human minds is not only wrong and dangerous but in the long run it is impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSocial Equality (1919)\nSeparation (1911)\nThe Social Equality of Whites and Blacks (1920)\n‘Social Equality’ (1911)\nLight (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1916. “Social Equality.”\nThe Crisis 12 (1): 30. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/12/01/social_equality.html."

White officers, knowing themselves in the wrong and afraid of the resistance of colored men, sneaked in at midnight to serve a warrant on a person who they hoped would be helpless and ignorant of their intentions. Two of them seized the man in his house and after the melee one of the white men was dead and the other seriously wounded. Of the right and wrong of this no one will ever be really sure. There is no proof that the black man was guilty; there is no proof that he knowingly resisted arrest. There is proof, on the other hand, that after this extraordinary attack his colored fellows acted like a set of cowardly sheep. Without resistance they let a white mob whom they outnumbered two to one, torture, harry and murder their women, shoot down innocent men entirely unconnected with the alleged crime, and finally to cap the climax, they caught and surrendered the wretched man whose attempted arrest caused the difficulty.\nNo people who behave with the absolute cowardice shown by these colored people can hope to have the sympathy or help of the civilized folk. The men and women who had nothing to do with the alleged crime should have fought in self-defense to the last ditch if they had killed every white man in the county and themselves been killed. The man who surrendered to a lynching mob the victim of the sheriff ought himself to have been locked up.\nIn the last analysis lynching of Negroes is going to stop in the South when the cowardly mob is faced by effective guns in the hands of the people determined to sell their souls dearly.\n\nIt may be a good thing to forget and forgive; but it is altogether too easy a trick to forget and be forgiven.\n– G.K.

It is a move of segregation, it “hyphenates” us, it separates us from our fellow Americans; but self-defense knows no nice hesitations. The American Negro must either vote as a unit or continue to be politically emasculated as at present.\nMiss Inez Milholland, in a recent address, outlined with singular clearness and force a Negro Party on the lines of the recently formed Woman’s Party. Mr. R. R. Church, Jr., of Tennessee, and certain leading colored men in New Jersey, Ohio and elsewhere have unconsciously and effectively followed her advice.\nThe situation is this: At present the Democratic party can maintain its ascendency only by the help of the Solid South. The Solid South is built on the hate and fear of Negroes; consequently it can never, as a party, effectively bid for the Negro vote. The Republican party is the party of wealth and big business and, as such, is the natural enemy of the humble working people who compose the mass of Negroes. Between these two great parties, as parties there is little to choose.\nOn the other hand, parties are represented by individual candidates. Negroes can have choice in the naming of these candidates and they can vote for or against them. Their only effective method in the future is to organize in every congressional district as a Negro Party to endorse those candidates, Republican, Democratic, Socialist, or What-not, whose promises and past performances give greatest hope for the remedying of the wrongs done the Negro race. If no candidate fills this bill they should nominate a candidate of their own and give that candidate their solid vote. This policy effectively and consistently carried out throughout the United States, North and South, by colored voters who refuse the bribe of petty office and money, would make the Negro vote one of the most powerful and effective of the group votes in the United States.\nThis is the program which we must follow.

    "text": "There are a large number of well meaning citizens of this country who are under the impression that the main lines of the American Negro problem are settled, and that while there is a deal more advance to be made, nevertheless, the average Negro, who is not too impatient, should be willing from now on to proceed toward his ultimate goal by quiet progress and unemotional appeal.\nThis is not true. It is so far from the truth that it is probably a fact that if inhabitants of a modern country, like France, England or Germany, who know the meaning of freedom, were subjected to the caste restrictions which surround American Negroes, they would without hesitation burst into flaming revolution.\nLet us consider the facts.\nWe may begin with marriage. A Negro in this country may not, in 26 of the 38 states, marry the person whom he wishes to marry, unless the partner is of Negro descent. Even if he has been married legally elsewhere, he may not in most Southern states live with his wife on pain of fine or imprisonment, unless she is also of Negro descent. A colored girl who is with a child by a white man in the South has no legal way of making her child legitimate, and in most Southern states and many Northern could get no standing in court. The very fact of having Negro blood is regarded in most Southern states as being such a stigma that the false allegation of it may be basis of an action for damages.\nThe Negro married couple may not live where they wish or in a home that they are able to buy. By law or custom, covenant or contract, or by mob violence, they are everywhere in the United States restricted in their right of domicile and for the most part must live in the worst parts of the city, and on the poorest land in the country; their sections receive from the local government the least attention and they are peculiarly exposed to crime and disease.\nNegroes are especially restricted in the chance to earn a living. If they are farmers in the South, the quality and situation of the land they can buy, their access to market, their freedom to plant and do business is seriously curtailed. They cannot in the South take part in co-operative farming or farmers’ organizations, except in organizations which are composed entirely of Negroes. They are restricted and systematically cheated in the selling of their crop. They have little chance for the education of their children and they have no voice in their own government and taxation, and over wide areas in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia Negro farm labor is held in actual peonage.\nIn general, Negroes are “segregated,” which means that their normal, social development in all lines is narrowed, curtailed or stopped. They cannot develop as a separate group without police power and inner social sanctions, economic protection and the power of public opinion. Where, for instance, schools are separated by race, the colored race has no power to select teachers, choose text books or administer its own schools, nor does it have voice in spending the school funds. It cannot develop as a part of the larger group because the developing and differentiating individual who by ability, education, wealth or character seeks to rise from the average level of weakness, ignorance, poverty, and delinquency of his group is clubbed back by the color bar and condemned to submersion or fruitless revolt.\nThis is especially illustrated in the Negroes’ efforts to earn a living. In manufacturing, business and industry, they cannot get capital to carry on enterprises unless they raise it in small sums from their own poverty. In case they do, their small capital, their inability to gain practical experience by contact, and their lack of credit dooms them from the start. In trade, Negroes are greatly restricted. Their small banks are entirely at the mercy of the big credit organizations. The retail stores stand little chance in competition with the chain stores, and in the chain stores for the most part no Negroes are hired as managers and few as clerks. In insurance, their opportunity is restricted by the white state insurance officials and by limited knowledge and opportunity for investment of funds.\nNegroes forming one-tenth of the population own but 1/140 per cent of the wealth. Their per capita wealth is $215 as compared with over $3,000 for the average American. They can command certainly not more than 1/10,000 of current bank credit.\nIf they learn mechanical trades they are restricted by the unions, most of which either by actual legislation or by vote of local unions will not allow them to join. If they do not join the Union, they only get a chance to work as scabs, in which case they are in danger of mob violence by their fellow workers and of a widespread propaganda which represents them as scabbing by choice or ignorance. If they attempt to form their own unions, they can seldom find enough Negroes in a given locality skilled to take over whole units of work. Negroes must, therefore, compete mostly for unskilled and semi-skilled labor below the current rate of wages. They cannot expect promotion. They have, therefore, no voice in the conduct of industry, and are liable to dismissal with the least consideration of any workers. Particularly, when it comes to new kinds of work and new machines and new methods, they are the last to be given an opportunity to learn and they are admitted to a minimum of wage and consideration.\nIn transportation, they can only work as common laborers and porters. The railway unions of engineers, conductors and firemen by constitutional enactment will not admit them. There is a colored Firemen’s Union but it has been fought in every way by the white firemen, who in the last few years have resorted to open murder. The union of Pullman Porters is excluded from the effective councils of the American Federation of Labor.\nIn public and civil service they are especially restricted, even under Civil Service rules. The United States Civil Service Commission requires the filing of a photograph with each application which makes and was designed to make the systematic exclusion of successful Negro applicants easier. Government trade-unions, like the postal clerks, segregate Negroes and thus disfranchise them in negotiations. In state, city and county civil service a few Negroes get in in the North; but in all the states of the Southern South any black man, whether he can read or write, or owns property, or whatever his qualifications, can be kept from effectively exercising the right to vote. In those Southern States where eight of the twelve million Negroes live there is not a single Negro member of the legislature, not a single Negro who holds a county office, not a single member of a city council, and of the 1,700 Southern cities and towns of 1,000 and more inhabitants, not 50 have a single Negro policeman. Negroes are thus taxed without representation and receive scant consideration from the officers of the administration.\nOn the stage and in literature and art, the Negro has some opportunity but his genius is limited by a public who will not endure any portrayal of a Negro save as a fun-maker, a moron or criminal. There have been some few exceptions to this but they emphasize the rule. Neither Paul Robeson nor Jules Bledsoe was allowed to sing the title role in “Emperor Jones” at the Metropolitan Opera; it was given to a white man blacked-up. Colored artists and writers who portray what they wish and feel and know get but a restricted and cool white audience and their colored audience is not only limited by poverty and ignorance, but its enlightened elements get their standards of judgment indirectly from the whites.\nThe Negro is forced into crime. His lawyers stand small opportunity in the courts of the South and restricted opportunity in the North. For the most part, the Negro is arrested by an ignorant, prejudiced and venal white policeman and his mere arrest usually means conviction. He gets little to no legal defense, and even if innocent, is apt to receive the “limit of the law.” His crime in the South is traded in so that many states actually make a surplus income by selling the work of criminals to private profiteers, The courts for years in the South have been made instruments for reducing the Negro to peonage and slavery. Any attempt to measure the real amount of Negro crime by counting the persons arrested and convicted is nonsense, and the treatment of Negroes in confinement can be read in Spivak’s “Georgia N⸺.”\nIn the professions, law, medicine and the ministry, the Negro must serve mainly his own race; for this reason, he is tempted or compelled to get cheaper or poorer preparation, to lack contact with the best and newest thought and method, to receive lower compensation and even if he surmounts these obstacles, to have his skill discounted and his opportunity curtailed on account of race.\nThere are (1926) in the United States, 232,154 churches, of which 42,585 are confined to Negroes, This leaves 189,569 white churches. Of at least 175,000 of these, no Negro can be a member. There are 5,535 Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. organizations, of which 200 are for Negroes. No Negro can join at least 5,000 of the other associations,\nIn domestic and personal service, the lower the grade of work, the more unprotected the women and children are, the larger opportunity is given to Negroes. Wherever the service is standardized and given a decent wage as in most first class hotels they are excluded.\nThe opportunity of the Negro for education is limited. In the sixteen former slave states in 1930, over a million Negro children of school age were not in school a single day in the year; and half the Negro children are not in regular attendance. Southern Negro children, forming a third of the school population, received 1/10 of the school funds, and the million and a half who attended school had an average term of only six months.\nIn the mixed schools of the North, colored children are often neglected and discouraged and if they are migrants from the South, suffer retardation because of lack of educational opportunity in early years.\nThe little money which the Negro earns is spent under equally difficult circumstances. In the South, he cannot travel without the insult of separate and inferior cars, for which he pays the standard price. On many express trains he cannot travel at all. In Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas he cannot use a sleeping car at all and in other Southern States he can hire a berth only under humiliating difficulties. In Southern railway stations he must often use side entrances. He cannot take recreation in public parks and museums, or in public buildings, at public lectures, concerts and entertainments, He is not admitted to public competitions on equal terms. He can attend most Northern colleges, but cannot instruct or teach or take advantage of scientific foundations, so that the whole field of graduate training and scientific research is thus seriously narrowed for him.\nHe lives under a stigma which is increased by deliberate propaganda: by the teaching of professors and school teachers, by the words of textbooks, by the distorted message of history, and by the deliberate misinterpretation of science. And above all, it is practically impossible for any Negro in the United States, no matter how small his heritage of Negro blood may be, to meet his fellow citizens on terms of social equality without being made the subject of all sorts of discriminations, embarassments and insults. Finally, the persons thus called and treated and measured as “Negroes” may be predominantly of Nordic blood with perhaps one Negro great-great grandparent in 16.\nIt would be untrue to say that all these restrictions happen to all Negroes at all times. There are innumerable exceptions, personal and geographical. Nevertheless, by and large, this is a true picture of the caste situation in the United States today. On the other hand, those people who insist that color discrimination has decreased are right. There was a time 100 years ago, when a Negro had no rights which a white man was bound to respect. Even 50 years ago, a white man had a right to knock a Negro down for any offense, real or fancied and walk away without danger or arrest. In certain districts of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia and Texas this is still true. In every Southern state and in some Northern states, the case of a white man who kills a Negro and is punished for it is regarded by the newspapers as unusual news. Today, in any altercation between a white and black man the burden of proof is on the black man and the chances of his getting the worst of it at the hands of the law are ten times as great as those of the white man.\nThis, then, is the situation, and the question is, what are modern, educated people going to do about, whether they are white or black?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro Citizen (1929)\nCorrespondence (1926)\nIntermarriage (1913)\nPan-Africa and New Racial Philosophy (1933)\nHistory of Segregation Philosophy (1934)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “Color Caste in the United States.”\nThe Crisis 40 (3): 59–60, 70. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/03/color_caste_in_the_united_states.html."

    "text": "We have been taught to regard the industrial system today as fixed and permanent. Our problem has been locked upon as the static one of adjusting ourselves to American industry and entering it on its own terms. Our first awakening came when we found that the technique of industry changes so fast and the machine displaces and modifies human labor in so many ways, that it is practically impossible for our Negro industrial schools to equip themselves so as to train youth for current work, while the actual shops and apprentice systems are largely closed to us.\nOur second lesson is to realize that the whole industrial system in the United States and in the world is changing and will change radically, either by swift evolution or here and there by revolution; and instead of our sitting like dumb and patient fools awaiting the salvation of the white industrial Lord, it is our duty now to prepare for a new organization and a new status, new modes of making a living, and a new organization of industry.\nIt is immaterial to us whether this change in the surrounding white world comes in ten, twenty-five or one hundred years. The fact is that the change is inevitable. No system of human culture can stand world war and industrial cataclysm repeatedly, without radical reorganization, either by reasoned reform or irrational collapse.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhat, then, shall we do? What can we do? Parties of reform, of socialism and communism beckon us. None of these offers us anything concrete or dependable. From Brook Farm down to the L.I.P.A., the face of reform has been set to lift the white producer and consumer, leaving the black man and his peculiar problems severely alone, with the fond hope that better white men will hate Negroes less and better white conditions make race contact more human and respectable. This has sometimes happened, but more often it has not.\nSocialists and Communists assume that state control of industry by a majority of citizens or by a dictatorship of laborers, is going in some magic way to abolish race prejudice of its own accord without special effort or special study or special plan; and they want us Negroes to assume on faith that this will be the result.\nYet nothing in the history of American socialism gives us the slightest assurance on this point, and with American communism led by a group of pitiable mental equipment, who give no thought to the intricacies of the American situation, the vertical and horizontal divisions of the American working classes; and who plan simply to raise hell on any and all occasions, with Negroes as shock troops,—these offer in reality nothing to us except social equality in jail.\nOn the other hand, we would be idiots not to recognize the imminence of industrial change along socialistic and even communistic lines, which the American revolution sooner or later is bound to take. If we simply mill contentedly after the streaming herd, with no clear idea of our own solutions of our problem, what can we expect but the contempt of reformers and slavery to a white proletariat? If we expect to enter present or future industry upon our own terms, we must have terms; we must have power; we must learn the secret of economic organization; we must submit to leadership, not of words but of ideas; we must weld the civilized part of these 12 millions of our race into an industrial phalanx that cannot be ignored, and which America and the world will come to regard as a strong asset under any system and not merely as a weak and despicable liability.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhat, then, shall we do? We cannot use the power of a State because we do not form a State. We cannot dictate as a proletariat, because we are a minority, and not as Marxism and Socialism usually assume an overwhelming majority with power in the reach of its outstretched arms.\nOn the contrary, we are a despised minority, whose social chains are not loosed, and who have the contempt of the white workers, even more than of capitalists and investors. Despite this, we are strong. Our unrealized strength is so enormous that the world wonders at our stupid apathy. We are physically able to survive slavery, lynching, debauchery, mob-rule, cheating and poverty, and yet remain the most prolific, original element in America, with good health and strength. We have brains, energy, and even taste and genius. From our depths of poverty, we have amassed some wealth. Out of charity, our schools, colleges and universities are growing to be real centers of learning, and Negro literature and art has been distilled from our blood and sweat. There is no way of keeping us in continued industrial slavery, unless we continue to enslave ourselves, and remain content to work as servants for white folk and dumb driven laborers for nothing.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhat can we do? We can work for ourselves. We can consume mainly what we ourselves produce, and produce as large a proportion as possible of that which we consume.\nGoing back to the preaching of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier, we can by consumers and producers cooperation, by phalanstéres and garden cities, establish a progressively self-supporting economy that will weld the majority of our people into an impregnable, economic phalanx.\nI am aware of the gale of laughter which such a proposal produces, not only from fools, but from serious students of economics, Of course, we are told, that 1848 scotched socialism; that “labor exchanges” failed; that New Harmony died; that Proudhon’s Bank of Exchange became a joke; and much else in this line. But the basic idea beneath all this did not fail, as thousands of successful co-operatives throughout the world testify; as Denmark and Russia are living witnesses; as the working men’s homes of Vienna prove. Remember production is already gone co-operative with technocratic control, oligarchic ownership and built on Democratic stupidity under a plutocracy. Consumption in all America is disorganized, blind and bamboozled by lying advertising and “high-powered” selling. Why may not Negroes begin consumers’ co-operation under intelligent democratic control and expand at least to the productive and consuming energy of this one group? There would be white monopoly and privilege to fight, but only stupidity and disloyalty could actually stop progress. Expell both unflinchingly.\nMoreover, our strength in Negro America lies in many respects precisely where the weaknesses of former cooperation and association lurked. We have a motive such as they never had. We are fleeing, not simply from poverty, but from insult and murder and social death. We have an instinct of race and a bond of color, in place of a protective tariff for our infant industry. We have, as police power, social ostracism within to coerce a race thrown back upon itself by ostracism without; and behind us, if we will survive, is Must, not May.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNegro American consumer’s cooperation will cost us something. It will mean inner subordination and obedience. It will call for inflexible discipline. It will mean years of poverty and sacrifice, but not aimless, rather to one great End. It will invite ridicule, retaliation and discrimination. All this and more. But if we succeed, we have conquered a world. No future revolution can ignore us. No nation, here or elsewhere, can oppress us. No capital can enslave us. We open the gates, not only to our own twelve millions, but to five million West Indians, and eight million black South Americans, and one hundred and fifty million and more Africans. We stretch hands and hands of strength and sinew and understanding to India and China, and all Asia. We become in truth, free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nOrganized Labor (1912)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nCo-Operation (1918)\nOur Class Struggle (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “The Right to Work.”\nThe Crisis 40 (4): 93–94. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/04/right_to_work.html."

There can be no protection for the disfranchised oppressed against the sadistic mob, even though the better thinking people of the state want justice and mercy.

    "text": "The growth of the Negro population in the United States has been an astonishing phenomenon, especially when we remember that in 1790, when there were only three-fourths of a million Negroes in the country, it was the generally accepted fact that without a slave trade Negroes could not survive. What happened was that slaves without a slave trade became more valuable and with cotton culture their value rose still further, so that they were fed adequately and their breeding systematically encouraged. The result was that the Negro population has increased as follows:\nNegro Population, 1790–1930\n\nThis means that each ten years the rate of increase of the Negroes has been:\n\nIt will be noticed that the rate has decreased. Just how much it has decreased, we do not know. The census figures are evidently inaccurate. The increase was smaller between 1860–1870 than between 1850–1860, but it was hardly reduced 50%; and so again the increase between 1910–1920 is officially reported as 6 1/2%, a ridiculous figure. In fact, in most states where Negroes live, accurate birth statistics are not kept. The only figures that give any true picture of our birth rate are the following, and they go only to 1910:\n\nIt is however clear that our birth rate is falling, just as the birth rate of all civilized peoples. It is probably falling faster in our case because of migration and the economic stress of the last few years. Our solicitude, however, is not for the number of children, but their quality, their health, the provision for their upbringing and education. Most of our increase today comes from the thoughtless peons of the black belt, while the better educated and most prosperous city groups are not reproducing themselves.

    "text": "Our death rate is without the slightest doubt a death rate due to poverty and discrimination.\nWhat little racial factor is present is too small to be taken into account. The scientific validity of such studies is utterly vitiated by ignoring not only the social condition and environment of those measured, but by classing all persons of Negro descent as belonging to the “Negro” race no matter what their percentage of white or Indian blood. Moreover, the majority of such “scientists” has been distinctly prejudiced and determined to prove an already assumed case.\nAs a problem of poverty our death rate can ultimately be brought down to normal size only as our income is increased. There are no reliable figures as to the average income of Negro families but it is certain that their average is far below the minimum which social agencies have from time to time established. What shall we do about our low wage? Our inadequate income?\nMeantime, there are certain matters we can stress even in our poverty:\n\nFresh air.\nMore nourishing food with less hot bread and fried greasy meat; with more vegetables, eggs, milk and greens.\nCleanliness in body and in crowded homes; in clothes.\nSleep, adequate in length and quiet.\nThe systematic use of physicians, dentists and hospitals; not simply to recover from disease but to prevent illness; especially the use of hospitals for births, severe illnesses and necessary operations.\n\nOn the other hand, an improvement in our present habits with regard to air, sleep, food, clothes and medical attention, and even increased income will not entirely settle our problem of sickness and death, so long as race discrimination continues on the lines in which we see it today. Even for those of us who are able to pay, hospital doors are today half-closed in our faces; parks, swimming pools and recreation centers often will not admit us; projects for improved housing seldom include us; and available food supply, particularly in cities, is vitiated by the custom of dumping the worst food at the highest prices into Negro districts; and police and sanitary control of our dwelling districts is universally neglected.\nFinally, there can be no doubt that the atmosphere of discrimination and insult and dislike acts as a general depressant, particularly on the young people of the Negro race. In such competitions as the Atwater-Kent auditions and the national oratorical contests and the competitions for scholarships and prizes, Negroes are continually made to realize that merit with a dark skin has great difficulty in winning. The resultant inferiority complex and even counsels of despair make for lack of stamina and resistance.\nHere, then, is our problem: Better income; better use of our present income; a frontal act upon race discrimination and a gospel of defiant hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nDeath Rates (1927)\nThe Census (1911)\nKnowledge (1911)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nVital Statistics (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “Our Health.” The Crisis 40\n(2): 44. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/02/our_health.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Critics of religion and of the church must distinguish rather carefully between the two. Religion is a theory of the ultimate constitution of the world, more particularly in its moral aspects, and as applied to questions of individual right and wrong. The church, on the other hand, is the organization which writes down and from time to time rewrites the exact religious belief which is prevalent and which carries out celebrations and methods of worship, particularly collects and spends money for its own organization and for certain religious and ethical objects.\nNow in both these things there are certain facts that are naturally indisputable. The first is that science, organized human knowledge, does not pretend to give a complete answer to the riddle of the universe. It frankly acknowledges that there are a great many things that we do not know and perhaps never can know. The right of any person to go beyond this scientific position and say that they believe certain things to be true, even though they cannot prove them is undoubted. It may lead down to the petty superstition of avoiding black cats or it may lead up to the belief in a divine personal ruler of the universe. It may be criticized as dangerous to logic and mental integrity for a person to assume too much beyond what can be proven. But to this there is a valid answer in saying that all the time we are making certain assumptions; we are assuming that the world which we see and hear and touch is the real world. We are assuming that the sun will rise tomorrow as it did yesterday. Life is largely and must be a series of assumptions. In so far as these assumptions are confirmed by the recurrent happenings of the world, we have a right to assume that they are approximately true. But we must even go beyond this. There is, for instance, faith in the triumph of good deeds; hope that the world will grow better; love of our relatives and our neighbors and of all humanity.\nIt would be difficult to adduce scientific proof that these hopes and faiths are justified, and still there is good reason for our assuming that they are and guiding our conduct accordingly.\nNow as expositor and preserver of assumed truth, and faith in the good, comes the organized church. The church tries to systematize these assumptions and explain and act on them; to write down the creed with exactness and even to go so far as to enforce its belief upon recalcitrants. This, of course, becomes immediately a difficult and dangerous task. And most of the criticism aimed against religion is primarily criticism of those organized churches which try to express religion. The church falls into all sorts of errors. It states as absolute truth one day that which it denies as truth the next day. If it were true in the 16th Century that unbaptised infants went to hell, how could it be also true in the 19th Century that they did not? If belief in miracles is declared essential to salvation in the 19th Century, what shall we say of the religion of people who today do not believe in sleight of hand, whether it is performed by Houdini or Jesus Christ?\nThen, too, when the organized church exercised power, its role is always dangerous. Its arguments cannot be refuted by an appeal to truth because it is not founded on truth but on faith. And by the very basis of its logic its faith is not proveable. What now must be the attitude of a man who does not believe all a church teaches and who proposes to be free and untrammeled in mind, charitable toward his fellows, and who wants on the whole to do what is right; that is; to injure no other man by his actions and to guide his own character along safe and beautiful paths.\nManifestly such a man joins an organized church with difficulty, because the statement of truth made by the church must always lag behind the truth as it is actually known. That is, the creed of the church must necessarily be handed down from a previous generation. It must state what our fathers and grandfathers believed, and for that very reason it cannot easily state what we believe. It must emphasize thin that seem trivial to us, no matter how important they were one thousand years ago. And for that reason there is always the endeavor on the part of the young and the thoughtful to lay less emphasis on creed and belief and more on ethics and action. But also and for equally evident reasons, the church continually attacks this attitude. Among Negroes especially today it is most natural for preachers to sneer at the man who is “merely” good and emphasize the transcendental value of the person who is too dumb to question any fairytale forced upon his belief.\nYet the young person who questions, who refuses to accept as truth all that he is told, is the salt of the earth and the hope of the future. And what the church must do, if it is going to retain the following of such persons is to remember that at best its creed is an unproven assumption of truth. This does not mean that it is absolutely wrong and in all probability it is not wholly wrong. But on the other hand, it does mean that it is both unwise and wicked to assert that the creed of a modern church is known to be an accurate statement of absolute truth. Moreover, there is grave, ethical and logical danger in not admitting this. An ethical danger because young people are often forced to subscribe to and say that they believe things which in the nature of the case they do not and cannot believe, and perhaps most of the muddle that faces us when we try to get people to think straight and reform industry and the state, arises from the cheap and false logic which they have daily thrust upon them in their religious life and experience through the organized church.\nWith such fundamental facts clearly in mind, a young Negro ought not to be puzzled by his religious surroundings. He should see in the church an expression of that desire for full and ultimate truth; that desire for goodness and beauty, which is ingrained in every human being; and on the other hand, and just as clearly, he should frankly denounce all attempt on the part of any organized body of human beings when they declare that they know it all and that God has personally told them about it. That is a plain lie and they know it and everybody else ought to know it. We must have religion in the sense of a striving for the infinite, the ultimate and the best. But just as truly we must straitly curb the effort of any exclusive guild to be the single and final arbitrator of individual interpretation of desired and desirable truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Church (1916)\nTo The World (1921)\nThe Negro Church (1912)\nThe Church and the Negro (1913)\nCrime (1918)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “The Church and Religion.”\nThe Crisis 40 (10): 236–37. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/10/church_and_religion.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the Marxist patois, the “class struggle” means the natural antagonism and war between the exploiter and the exploited; that is, between those persons who own capital in the form of machines, raw material and money, and who can command credit, and that other large mass of people who have practically nothing to sell but their labor. Between these two classes, there can be no peace because the profit of the capitalist depends on the amount of surplus value he can extract from the work of the laborer.\nOne no sooner states this than the expert would say immediately that there is no trace of such class struggle among American Negroes. On second thought, however, he might modify this and say that the occupational differences of American Negroes show at least the beginnings of differentiation into capitalists and laborers.\nOf Negroes, 10 years of age and over in gainful occupations, there are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkilled laborers\n331,839\n\n\nSemi-Skilled laborers\n734,951\n\n\nFarmers\n873,653\n\n\nCommon laborers\n3,374,545\n\n\nTrade and Business\n52,957\n\n\nProfessional\n119,827\n\n\nCivil Service\n15,763\n\n\nTotal\n5,503,535\n\n\n\nOf the farmers, 181,016 were owners. The others were tenants. We may, therefore, say that the capitalistic class among Negroes would be among the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Business\n52,957\n\n\nProfessional\n119,827\n\n\nFarm Owners\n181,016\n\n\nCivil Service\n15,763\n\n\nTotal\n369,563\n\n\n\nMost of these however depend for their income on labor rather than capital. Those in trade and business, include clerks, as well as about 30,000 investors of capital. And the professional men are not capitalists, except as some of them have saved money. The same thing can be said of the civil servants. The farm owners are by vast majority peasant proprietors, most of whom hire a little or no labor outside the family.\nThe most that can be said is that many of the people in this group have the American ambition to become rich and “independent;” to live on income rather than labor, and thus their ideology ranks them on the side of the white capitalists. On the other hand, the laborers, skilled and semi-skilled, and the tenants, are all a proletariat, exploited by white capital. One has, therefore, a rather curious arrangement, with the real class struggle not between colored classes, but rather between colored and white folk.\nThere is, however, an inner division that calls for attention because it emphasizes and foreshadows class distinctions within the race. And that is the existence of delinquency and dependency, of criminals and paupers. What is the extent of this class among American Negroes and what is the relation of the class to the workers and the more prosperous elements who have begun to accumulate property?\nDuring the earlier history of the colored race, there was a natural social and class difference that came through the existence of mulattoes. In the West Indies, by French law, these mulattoes were free and often inherited wealth from their fathers. In many cases, they were carefully educated and formed a distinct social class, whose rank depended upon wealth, education and personal freedom. In the later history of the French colonies, and even more in Spanish and American colonies, persistent effort reduced this class to a semi-servile position, and it was the resentment against this that led the mulattoes to unite with the blacks in the Haitian Revolution and overthrow the whites.\nIn the United States, this color caste was dealt a death blow by the law that made children follow the condition of the mother, so that white fathers sold their colored children into slavery, and the mulatto ceased to be, in most cases, a free man. He inherited no property from his father and lost his right to education; although so far as he was free, he promoted schools, in centers like Washington, Charleston and New Orleans.\nThe color caste idea persisted after Emancipation, but was gradually driven out by the new economic organization. In this new economy there arose the criminals and paupers;—the direct result of the poverty of a suddenly emancipated class who had little or no capital.\nThe apparent criminality, however, of the Negro race is greatly exaggerated for two reasons: First, accusation of crime was used systematically in the South to keep Negroes in serfdom after the Civil War; and secondly, Negroes receive but scant justice in the courts. Most writers, today, have assumed on the basis of statistics, that because the Negro population in jails and penitentiary is proportionately much larger than the white population, that, therefore, the Negro is unusually criminal. But as Thorsten Sellin has pointed out in his note on the Negro criminal, “The American Negro lacks education and earthly goods. He has had very little political experience and industrial training. His contact with city life has been unfortunate, for it has forced him into the most dilapidated and vicious areas of our great cities. Like a shadow over his whole existence lies the oppressive race prejudice of his white neighbor, restricting his activities and thwarting his ambitions. It would be extraordinary, indeed, if this group were to prove more law-abiding than the white, which enjoys more fully the advantages of a civilization the Negro has helped to create.”*\nOn the other hand, the peculiar result of the assumed fact that Negroes are criminal is that within the race, a Negro accused or convicted of a crime immediately suffers a penalty, not only of ostracism, but lack of sympathy. Negroes make comparatively little effort to defend the accused; they do not systematically look after them; the churches take little interest in delinquents, and the general attitude of the race is one of irritation toward these members of their groups who have brought the whole race into disrepute. This makes a peculiarly bitter feeling among the unfortunate of the race and the more successful.\nSo far as dependents are concerned, again the material which we have to measure the amount of dependents is inconclusive and unsatisfactory. There are such differences in policy in various states, such difference in treatment that it is hard to say what the condition is. It would seem, by a study of states where there is a substantial uniform policy toward the feeble-minded and paupers, regardless of race, that there is a higher rate of institutionization among Negroes than among whites. And this would be natural unless corrected by taking into account the unequal economic and social condition.\nHere again within the race, there is a certain resentment against a colored person who fails to progress as rapidly as the Negro thinks a black man must. When, therefore, such a person becomes a subject of charity and must be put into an institution, he is regarded not so much as unfortunate as in some vague way blame worthy. He hinders the general advance and even if he is not at fault, his existence is a misfortune. The real question, then, in the Negro race, is how far the group can and should assume responsibility for its delinquents and dependents, and cultivate sympathy and help for these unfortunates, and how far in this way differentiation into class can keep economic exploitation from becoming a settled method of social advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nEugene Debs (1926)\nEmployment (1932)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “Our Class Struggle.”\nThe Crisis 40 (7): 164–65. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/07/our_class_struggle.html."

    "text": "This is part of an address on “The Field and Function of a Negro College,” delivered at the annual alumni reunion during commencement week at Fisk University last June. The complete address has been issued in pamphlet form by the University.\nIt has been said many times that a Negro University is nothing more and nothing less than a university. Quite recently one of the great leaders of education in the United States, Abraham flexner, said something of that sort concerning Howard, As President of the Boaard of Trustees, he said he was seeking to build not a Negro university, but a University. And by those words he brought again before our eyes the ideal of a great institution of learning which becomes a center of universal culture. With all good will toward them that say such words–it is the object of this paper to insist that there can be no college for Negroes which is not a Negro college and that while an American Negro university, just like a German or Swiss university may rightly aspire to a universal culture unhampered by limitations of race and culture, yet it must start on the earth where we sit and not in the skies whither we aspire. May I develop this thought.\nIn the first place, we have got to remember that here in America, in the year 1933, we have a situation which cannot be ignored. There was a time when it seemed as though we might best attack the Negro problem by ignoring its most unpleasant features. It was not and is not yet in good taste to speak generally about certain facts which characterize our situation in America.\nWe are politically ham-strung. We have the greatest difficulty in getting our suitable and remunerative work. Our education is more and more not only being confined to our own schools but to a segregated public school system far below the average of the nation with one-third of our children continuously out of school. And above all, and this we like to least mention, we suffer social ostracism which is so deadening and discouraging that we are compelled either to lie about it or to turn our faces to the red flag of revolution. It consists of studied and repeated and emphasized public insult of the sort which during all the long history of the world has led men to kill or be killed. And in the full face of any effort which any bllack man may make to escape this ostracism for himself, stands this flaming sword of racial doctrine which will distract his effort and energy if it does not lead him to spiritual suicide.\nWe boast and have right to boast of our accomplishment between the days that I studied here and this 45th Anniversary of my graduation. It is a calm appraisal of fact to say that the history of modern civilization cannot surpass if it can parallel the advance of American Negroes in every essential line of culture in these years. And yet, when we have said this we must have the common courage honestly to admit that every step we have made forward has been greeted by a step backward on the part of the American public in caste intolerance, mob law and racial hatred.\nI need but remind you that when I graduated from Fisk there was no “Jim Crow” car in Tennessee and I saw Hunter of ’89 once sweep a brakeman aside at the Union Station and escort a crowd of Fisk students into the first-class seats for which they had paid. There was no legal disfranchisement and a black Fiskite sat in the Legislature; and while the Chancellor of the Vanderbilt University had annually to be re-introduced to the President of Fisk, yet no white Southern group presumed to dictate the internal social life of this institution.\nManifestly with all that can be said, pro and con, and in extenuation, and by way of excuse and hope, this is the situation and we know it. There is no human way by which these facts can be ignored. We cannot do our daily work, sing a song or write a book or carry on a university and act as though these things were not.\nIf this is true, then no matter how much we may dislike the statement, the American Negro problem is and must be the center of the Negro American university. It has got to be. You are teaching Negroes. There is no use pretending that you are teaching Chinese or that you are teaching white Americans or that you are teaching citizens of the world. You are teaching American Negroes in 1933, and they are the subjects of a caste system in the Republic of the United States of America and their life problem is primarily this problem of caste.\nUpon these foundations, therefore, your university must start and build. Nor is the thing so entirely unusual or unheard of as it sounds. A university in Spain is not simply a university. It is a Spanish university. It is a university located in Spain. It uses the Spanish language. It starts with Spanish history and makes conditions in Spain the starting point of its teaching. Its education is for Spaniards,—not for them as they may be or ought to be, but as they are with their present problems and disadvantages and opportunities.\nIn other words, the Spanish university is founded and grounded in Spain, just as surely as a French university is French. There are some people who have difficulty in apprehending this very clear truth. They assume, for instance, that the French university is in a singular sense universal, and is based on a comprehension and inclusion of all mankind and of their problems. But it is not so, and the assumption that it is arises simply because so much of French culture has been built into universal civilization. A French university is founded in France; it uses the French language and assumes a knowledge of French history. The present problems of the French people are its major problems and it becomes universal only so far as other peoples of the world comprehend and are at one with France in its mighty and beautiful history.\nIn the same way, a Negro university in the United States of America begins with Negroes. It uses that variety of the English idiom which they understand; and above all, it is founded or it should be founded on a knowledge of the history of their people in Africa and in the United States, and their present condition. Without white-washing or translating wish into fact, it begins with that; and then it asks how shall these young men and women be trained to earn a living and live a life under the circumstances in which they find themselves or with such changing of those circumstances as time and work and determination will permit.\nIs this statement of the field of a Negro university a denial of aspiration or a change from older ideals? I do not think it is, although I admit in my own mind some change of thought and modification of method. The system of learning which bases its self upon the actual condition of certain classes and groups of human beings is tempted to suppress a minor premise of fatal menace. It proposes that the knowledge given and the methods pursued in such institutions of learning shall be for the definite object of perpetuating present conditions or of leaving their amelioration in the hands of and at the initiative of other forces and other folk. This was the great criticism that those of us who fought for higher education of Negroes thirty years ago, brought against the industrial school.\nThe industrial school founded itself and rightly upon the actual situation of American Negroes and said: “What can be done to change this situation?” And its answer was: “A training in technique and method such as would incorporate the disadvantaged group into the industrial organization of the country, and in that organization the leaders of the Negro had perfect faith. Since that day the industrial machine has cracked and groaned. Its technique has changed faster than any school could teach; the relations of capital and labor have increased in complication and it has become so clear that Negro poverty is not primarily caused by ignorance of technical knowledge that the industrial school has almost surrendered its program.\nIn opposition to that, the opponents of college training in those earlier years said: “What black men need is the broader and more universal training so that they can apply the general principle of knowledge to the particular circumstances of their condition.”\nHere again was the indubitable truth but incomplete truth. The technical problem lay in the method of teaching this broader and more universal truth and here just as in the industrial program, we must start where we are and not where we wish to be.\nAs I said a few years ago at Howard University, both these positions had thus something of truth and right. Because of the peculiar economic situation in our country the program of the industrial school came to grief first and has practically been given up. Starting even though we may with the actual condition of the negro peasant and artisan, we cannot ameliorate his condition simply by learning a trade which is the technique of a passing era. More vision and knowledge is needed than that. But on the other hand, while the Negro college of a generation ago set down a defensible and true program of applying knowledge to facts, it unfortunately could not completely carry it out, and it did not carry it out, because the one thing that the industrial philosophy gave to education, the Negro college did not take and that was that the university education of black men in the United States must be grounded in the condition and work of those black men!\nOn the other hand, it would be of course idiotic to say, as the former industrial philosophy almost said, that so far as most black men are concerned education must stop with this. No, starting with present conditions and using the facts and the knowledge of the present situation of American Negroes, the Negro university expands toward the possession and the conquest of all knowledge. It seeks from a beginning of the history of the Negro in America and in Africa to interpret all history; from a beginning of social development among Negro slaves and freedmen in America and Negro tribes and kingdoms in Africa, to interpret and understand the social development of all mankind in all ages. It seeks to reach modern science of matter and life from the surroundings and habits and aptitudes of American Negroes and thus lead up to understanding of life and matter in the universe.\nAnd this is a different program than a similar function would be in a white university or in a Russian university or in an English university, because it starts from a different point. It is a matter of beginnings and integrations of one group which seep instinctive knowledge and inheritance and current reactions into a universal world of science, sociology and art. In no other way can the American Negro College function. It cannot begin with history and lead to Negro History. It cannot start with sociology and lead to Negro sociology.\nWhy was it that the Renaissance of literature which began among Negroes ten years ago has never taken real and lasting root? It was because it was a transplanted and exotic thing. It was a literature written for the benefit of white people and at the behest of white readers, and starting out privately from the white point of view. It never had a real Negro constituency and it did not grow out of the inmost heart and frank experience of Negroes; on such an artificial basis no real literature can grow.\nOn the other hand, if starting in a great Negro university you have knowledge, beginning with the particular, and going out to universal comprehension and unhampered expression; you are going to begin to realize for the American Negro the full life which is denied him now. And then after that comes a realization of the older object of our college—to bring this universal culture down and apply it to the individual life and individual conditions of living Negroes.\nThe university must become not simply a center of knowledge but a center of applied knowledge and guide of action. And this is all the more necessary now since we easily see that planned action especially in economic life, is going to be the watchword of civilization.\nIf the college does not thus root itself in the group life and afterward apply its knowledge and culture to actual living, other social organs must replace the college in this function. A strong, intelligent family life may adjust the student to higher culture; and, too, a social clan may receive the graduate and induct him into life. This has happened and is happening among a minority of privileged people. But it costs society a fatal price. It tends to hinder progress and hamper change; it makes Education, propaganda for things as they are. It leaves the mass of those without family training and without social standi misfits and rebels who despite their education are uneducated in its meaning and application. The only college which stands for the progress of all, mass as well as aristocracy, functions in root and blossom as well as in the overshadowing and heaven-filling tree. No system of learning—no university can be universal before it is German, French, Negro. Grounded in inexorable fact and condition, in Poland, Italy or elsewhere, it may seek the universal and haply it may find it—and finding it, bring it down to earth and us.\nWe have imbibed from the surrounding white world a childish idea of Progress. Progress means bigger and better results always and forever. But there is no such rule of Life. In 6000 years of human culture, the losses and retrogressions have been enormous. We have no assurance this twentieth century civilization will survive. We do not know that American Negroes will survive. There are sinister signs about us, antecedent to and unconnected with the Great Depression. The organized might of industry north and south is relegating the Negro to the edge of survival and using him as a labor reservoir on starvation wage. No secure professional class, no science, literature, nor art can live on such a sub-soil. It is an insistent, deep-throated cry for rescue, guidance and organized advance that greets the black leader today, and the college that trains him has got to let him know at least as much about the great black miners’ strike in Alabama as about the age of Pericles.\nWe are on the threshold of a new era. Let us not deceive ourselves with outworn ideals of wealth and servants and luxuries, reared on a foundation of ignorance, starvation and want. Instinctively, we have absorbed these ideals from our twisted white American environment. This new economic planning is not for us unless we do it. Unless the American Negro today, led by trained university men of broad vision, sits down to work out by economics and mathematics, by physics and chemistry, by history and sociology, exactly how and where he is to earn a living and how he is to establish a reasonable Life in the United States or elsewhere—unless this is done, the university has missed its field and function and the American Negro is doomed to be a suppressed and inferior car*e in the United States for incalculable time.\nHere, then, is a job for the American Negro university. It cannot be successfully ignored or dodged without the growing menace of disaster. I lay the problem before you as one which you must not ignore.\nTo carry out this plan, two things and only two things are necessary,—teachers and students. Buildings and endowments may help, but they are not indispensable. It is necessary first to have teachers who comprehend this program and know how to make it live among their students. This is calling for a good deal, because it asks that teachers teach that which they have learned in no American school and which they never will learn until we have a Negro university of the sort that I am visioning. No teacher, black or white, who comes to a university like Fisk, filled simply with general ideas of human culture or general knowledge of disembodied science, is going to make a university of this school. Because a university is made of human beings, learning of the things they do not know from the things they do know in their own lives.\nAnd secondly, we must have students. They must be chosen for their ability to learn. There is always the temptation to assume that the children of privileged classes, the rich, the noble, the white, are those who can best take education. One has but to express this to realize its utter futility. But perhaps the most dangerous thing among us is for us, without thought, to imitate the white world and assume that we can choose students at Fisk because of the amount of money which their parents have happened to get hold of. That basis of selection is going to give us an extraordinary aggregation. We want, by the nicest methods possible, to seek out the talented and the gifted among our constituency, quite regardless of their wealth or position, and to fill this utiversity and similar institutions with persons who have got brains enough to take fullest advantage of what the university offers. There is no other way. With teachers who know what they are teaching and whom they are teaching, and the life that surrounds both the knowledge and the knower, and with students who have the capacity and the will to absorb this knowledge, we can build the sort of Negro university which will emancipate not simply the black folk of the United States, but those white folk who in their effort to suppress Negroes have killed their own culture.\nMen in their desperate effort to replace equality with caste and to build inordinate wealth on a foundation of abject poverty have succeeded in killing democracy, art and religion.\nOnly a universal system of learning, rooted in the will and condition of the masses and blossoming from that manure up towards the stars is worth the name. Once builded it can only grow as it brings down sunlight and starshine and impregnates the mud.\nThe chief obstacle in this rich land endowed with every national resource and with the abilities of a hundred different peoples—the chief and only obstacle to the coming of that kingdom of economic equality which is the only logical end of work, is the determination of the white world to keep the black world poor and make themselves rich. The disaster which this selfish and short-sighted policy has brought, lies at the bottom of this present depression, and too, its cure lies beside it. Your clear vision of a world without wealth, of capital without profit, of income based on work alone, is the path out not only for you but for all men.\nIs not this a program of segregation, emphasis of race and particularism as against national unity and universal humanity? It is and it is not by choice but by force; you do not get humanity by wishing it nor do you become American citizens simply because you want to. A Negro university, from its high ground of unfaltering facing of the Truth, from its unblinking stare at hard facts does not advocate segregation by race; it simply accepts the bald fact that we are segregated, apart, hammered into a separate unity by spiritual intolerance and legal sanction backed by mob law, and that this separation is growing in strength and fixation; that it is worse today than a half century ago and that no character, address, culture or desert is going to change it in our day or for centuries to come. Recognizing this brute fact, groups of cultured, trained and devoted men gathering in great institutions of learning proceed to ask: What are we going to do about it? It is silly to ignore the gloss of truth; it is idiotic to proceed as though we were white or yellow, English Or Russian. Here we stand. We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology; and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory and one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. This is our given and at present unalterable fact. Our problem is: How far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of this group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay:\n“If we must die, let it not be like hogs.”\nBut the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy, but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it and above all to give it unhampered spiritual expression in art and literature. It is the counsel of fear and cowardice to say this cannot be done. What must be can be and it is only a question of Science and Sacrifice to bring the great consummation.\nWhat that will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the Color Line; it may be an economic rebirth which ensures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift—but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift-flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan, knowledge and organization. If the college can pour into the coming age an American Negro who knows himself and his plight and how to protect himself and fight race prejudice, then the world of our dream will come and not otherwise.\n\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “The Negro College.” The Crisis. 40(8):175–177.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSchools (1917)\nNegro Education (1918)\nEducation (1911)\nEmployment (1932)\nThe Negro Public School (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “The Negro College.”\nThe Crisis 40 (8): 175–77. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/08/negro_college.html."

    "text": "A college graduate came to me yesterday and asked: “What has the N.A.A.C.P. published concerning the present problems of the Negro, and especially of young Negroes just out of college?”\nI started to answer with stereotyped remarks; and then I said suddenly, “Nothing.”\nThe N.A.A.C.P., beginning nearly a quarter of a century ago, formulated on the basis of the problems which then faced Negroes, a clear-cut and definite program. This program we have followed ever since with unusual success for it has expressed during these years the aspirations and lines of effort among 12 millions and their friends.\nToday the situation has changed enormously in its trend, objects and details, and there is both need and widespread demand for a re-examination of what is called the Negro problem from the point of view of the middle of the 20th Century. The Crisis realizes this and it proposes during 1933 to discuss the present Negro problems from 12 points of view. Tentatively, these points seem to us now to be something as follows, although we may change many of them:\n\nBirth. The physical survival of the Negro in America is discussed in this number.\nHealth. In February, we shall ask: How can the infant mortality, the great loss from sickness and the general death rate among Negroes, be lowered? What is the duty of colored physicians toward Negro health? What is the extent of available hospitalization? How can we extend the life term and meet such enemies of our race as tuberculosis, pneumonia, syphilis and cancer.\n\nLater, we shall treat our problems in something like the following order:\n\nThe Home. Should a Negro family live in the city or in the country, in the North or in the South, in a single house or in an apartment? And on what facts should an individual family base its decision? How can housework be reduced and systematized? Must paid household help be an ideal? Should Negroes seek to live in their own neighborhoods or in white neighborhoods?\nOccupations. What kinds of work do Negroes want to do and what kind can they do and what kinds are they allowed to do? How far shall they be farmers, artisans, artists, professional men, merchants or financiers? What is their relation to the great economic and industrial changes going on now in the world of work? How far are they being displaced by machines and technique and by new organizations of capital? Can they achieve a place of power and efficiency in the present oligarchy of white capital or in the present labor union or in any future industrial democracy?\nEducation. Should a colored child be sent to a white school or to a colored school? Should it be educated in the North or South or even abroad? What should be the kind and aim and length of its education? Should the boy or girl go to college? Should they go to technical school? Should they go to professional school? Should they be apprenticed to manual work? Should they depend for their education upon experience? How far is their education dependent upon contact with the white group and its larger opportunities? How shall the cost of education be met?\nIncome. What should be the ideal and standards of living among colored people? How much income must the average colored family have and how should it be spent? How early can our young people get married? What things must they regard as luxuries and beyond them and what as necessities? Shall we aim to be rich or make poverty an ideal?\nDiscrimination. Accepting race and color discrimination as a fact which despite all effort’s bound to last in some form at least through this generation, if not longer, what shall be our general attitude toward it? How can we avoid in its face an inferiority complex? How far must we be belligerent or acquiescent? Can we meet discrimination by ignoring it or by fighting it? When shall we fight and how shall we fight, and what is the cost of effective fighting? What types of organized effort are needed in this fighting? How much of co-operation with the whites must be sought or accepted? How far must we be willing recipients of white co-operation, philanthropy and charity? How can we escape discrimination by emigration to other states, countries or continents?\nGovernment and Law. How far must we be obedient to government and law when they are unfair to us? Can we adopt an attitude of defiance? How can we change our legal status or reform evil administration? Is revolution by force advisable, possible or probable? Can we use our right to vote, curtailed as it is, for our emancipation and change of status? Should we vote for the Republican Party or the Democratic Party; or for Socialists or Communists? Or should we adopt a method of independent opportunism in our voting? In states and cases where we are disfranchised, what shall we do about it? Is it worth while to register, even though we cannot vote or cannot vote effectively? Should we join the Democratic White Primary in the South? Should we in our voting keep our racial needs and demands in mind, or should we have an eye upon the good of the majority of the nation? And what shall we do in case these two ideals clash? How far are we criminal and antisocial? What causes and what can prevent crime? How are our criminals treated?\nRace Pride. How far shall American Negroes remember and preserve their history, keep track of their ancestry, build up a racial literature and a group patriotism? What does loyalty to the race mean? How far shall we have distinctively race organizations, and how far shall we seek to join organizations regardless of race? If we do have organizations, what sorts are needed for the various ends we have in view? How far do present organizations fill our need or how shall they be changed and what new ones must come? Shall we imitate and duplicate, on our side of the color line, the organizations that white folk have? Especially, of what use are secret fraternities and how can their functioning be made to help our general uplift? What is our relation to Africa, to the West Indies, to Asia, to the colored world in general? Is it profitable or advisable consciously to build up by race pride a nation within a nation, or races within the world?\nReligion. We are by tradition a religious people and the “old-time religion” still has a strong hold on our masses. The present Negro church more nearly represents the mass of people than any other organization and its ministers are its spokesmen. Nevertheless, the number of colored people who do not go to church is large and growing. Is this right, and if not, what is the remedy? What should be the function of the Negro church? How far should there be churches divided along the color line? What is the present status of creeds? How far do we dare disturb simple religious faith, “evangelical” dogma and ordinary religious superstition? Should a man join a church and work with it if he does not believe completely in its dogma? Can the Negro church be made a center and unit of racial and cultural and social development? Will Creed and Culture, Reason and Faith, Science and Superstition clash as in other groups and ages? What should be the attitude of the Negro church toward white churches? How far should they co-operate in missions and philanthropy? How far is the white church, with its greater wealth and experience, pauperizing certain colored churches? What is the remedy? Will Christianity abolish or emphasize the Color Line? How can we, with or without religion, encourage courtesy, honor, unselfishness, sacrifice, self restraint, the ideals of the higher spiritual life, the recognition of beauty in Art and deed?\nSocial Contacts. Is the method of advance among colored people today a building up of social classes so that the educated, the rich, the well-to-do and the moral can separate themselves from the poor, the ignorant and the criminal? Can this class-building technique of civilization be ignored in our case and something better substituted? How far must colored people try to accumulate wealth and become the employers of other Negroes and even of whites? Must we have a bourgeoisie for defense in a bourgeois world? What should be our social standards in marriage? Should we encourage our children to inter-marry with white folk, or at any rate, to increase the social contacts between colored and white people with the ultimate ideal of marriage? And if not, where can the line be drawn? In the absence of social contact with more favored persons and races, is it possible for culture among us to grow or to grow as fast? Should we demand and practice social equality? Should we regard the development of lower masses among our people as inevitable, and if so, what should be our attitude toward these masses? What should be our attitude toward social questions beyond our own racial orders, toward world problems of peace and war, the labor movement, the status of women, education, health, social and economic reform?\nRecreation. How can we get the relaxation of play and recreation without having it spoiled by discrimination along the color line? Should we travel, and if we travel, should we seek or avoid white people? Where can we spend our vacations? Where can we bathe in the ocean unmolested and not insulted? What should be our attitude toward discrimination in transport, railroad trains, buses and hotels? Where shall we be willing to sit in theatres and at concerts? If we seek recreation only in those places where there is no discrimination, will that help uplift by increasing our pleasure or will it encourage the growth of further discrimination?\n\nThe above is a tentative outline of 12 sets of problems. Further reflection will doubtless change and add to them. There are doubtless important omissions. The Crisis would welcome from readers suggestions as to these heads.\nIn the meantime, it is our present plan to publish a discussion of one of these subjects in each of the next 12 numbers The Crisis, which will exhibit different points of view concerning the main problems suggested. We would be glad to have contributions or suggestions as to persons who might contribute to these symposiums. Of necessity, the contributions must be terse and to the point, and, of course, we cannot publish all. Beside the editorial statement of the problem, and papers discussing two or more sides of the problem, we are going to try to get hold of 12 pieces of fiction which will illustrate the problems humanly. We admit it is going to be a hard thing to do this.\nWhat we want is suggested by the story this month—“The Three Mosquitoes.” Do you like it? Is it worth while? Such stories must be short,—not more than two pages of The Crisis,—and they must illustrate the difficulties and contradictions of each of these 12 suggested matters of thought. They must not be “defeatist;” we want them to be artistic; we want them true: but we do not propose to have every story end in a lynching or a suicide, for the simple reason that we do not believe that death is the necessary answer to any of these situations.\nFinally, we welcome from everybody, terse, definite and pointed opinions, which we shall try to reflect and quote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nThe Name Negro (1928)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nBrowsing Reader - The American Race Problem (1927)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “Toward a New Racial Philosophy.”\nThe Crisis 40 (1): 20–22. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/01/toward_a_new_racial_philosophy.html."

    "text": "There was a time when the Negro race in America had a right to boast that its manners were better than those of its white neighbors. They were insistently courteous and soft-voiced. Their experience of public insult gave them a sort of social sense of what was due the individual in personal deference and of the good policy and kindliness that lay behind: “Excuse me,” “I thank you,” “Please.”\nIt was perhaps inevitable that this phase should pass. No group of people who have been so persistently insulted as American Negroes, can be expected to preserve their manners; but it is worthwhile that they should at least regret the loss and not forget what is after all due themselves. There is a story, probably apocryphal, that George Washington was rebuked for raising his hat to a colored person and simply said that he could not let anyone outdo him in politeness. Nothing of this older ideal of a Southern gentleman remains.\nThe other day in Atlanta five persons in succession entered and left an elevator. On the first floor, two ladies entered, both teachers; one a Master of Arts from the University of Cincinnati, and the other trained in an excellent Northern institution. At the next floor, two boys entered, perhaps eight and twelve years of age. They kept their hats on. At the next floor, another lady entered. Both boys removed their hats. At the next floor, the last lady got out. The boys put their hats back on. The two first ladies and the boys left the elevator at the last floor.\nTo the stranger this would be inexplicable; but to one who knows the South and also knows that the two first ladies were colored, the magnificent training of these young white Southern gentlemen is evident.\nOr again, every once in a while a journal, like the Atlanta Constitution, will commission its office boy to write the regular editorial about Negroes returning South after unfortunate experiences in Harlem and after realizing that the “Southern white people are the Negroes best friends.” The Constitution does not allow for an occurrence like this, which is not exactly a matter of life and death or even of bread and butter:\nThe daughter of a colored teacher was entertaining some young friends in the dining room, when the agent of the electric company appeared at the front door to examine the meter. The mother went to the door. In order to get to the meter, he must walk through the house. He started in. The mother said: “You’ll have to remove your hat.” He gave her to understand that he was not used to removing his hat in houses of “niggers.” She refused to let him come in with his hat on, and he thereupon went to the curb and turned out all the lights in the house.\nThis sort of thing has sad effect upon the manners of colored people. They visit vicariously the insults of ignorant boors and savages, North and South, upon the mass of people, white and colored, with whom they come in contact. They push their way through crowds carelessly; their methods of salutations are crude; they ask pardon of no one, and they assert themselves offensively. Some how and in some way our younger generation must learn that courtesy and manners are not solely for the benefit of the other person; they are tributes to our own self-respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPoliteness (1911)\nA Matter of Manners (1920)\nVeiled Insults (1914)\nJim Crow (1919)\nSocial Equality (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “A Matter of Manners.”\nThe Crisis 40 (12): 292–93. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/12/matter_of_manners.html."

    "text": "Forty-odd years ago, when stalwart Young Dendy and slim Martha Duckett were married, their fortune consisted of youth, health and intelligence. They went to housekeeping with cheerful enthusiasm in a one-roomed cabin. Today they live in a spacious home; but the South has robbed them of their gay enthusiasm.\nThen their future held no shadow. Young was a carpenter, able and reliable, hence always in demand. He did not know what it meant to be out of a job. His energetic Martha took in washings, kept the cabin spic and span, nursed and cared for her healthy brown babies. Together they worked and saved and shrewdly invested their savings. They moved into a two-roomed cabin, and then, as they prospered and their family grew, they built themselves a neat, four-roomed cottage.\nAs the children grew the young parents watched them thoughtfully. They sent them to school with punctual regularity and took it as a matter of course that they should lead their classes. Less was hardly tolerated in the Dendy home. But school was not enough. There were the long sunny vacation months to be provided with an occupation. So they bought a little plot of ground—not too much—on which a small cotton crop could be made and the lesson of labor learned as small muscles grew hard. Even baby Mattie, the pet of the family knew what chopping cotton meant and picked her full share from the ripened bolls.\nBy the time that William, the oldest, had finished the local school Mr. Dendy had become a contractor and was putting up buildings for the white people of Clinton from plans drawn by himself. His integrity was a by-word. And Mrs. Dendy was not behind him. She now hired the best workers in town to help in her laundry although the difficult pieces were trusted to no hands but her own. With the college students whose work she did she formed genuine friendships, and they relished with youthful appreciation her shrewd and humorous insight.\nIn Clinton, South Carolina, there are three fine large public school buildings—for white children. They are built of brick, two-stories, with excellent equipment, and they are free. There is a splendid high school, the pride of the town—for white children.\nFor colored children (the population is 60% colored) there is one school. It is a one-story building with fair equipment furnished largely by private funds. The teachers are well-trained. But it is not free. Each child must pay two dollars a year for the privilege of going to this “public school,” in addition to buying his books. Those who cannot pay, and there are many, do not go to school.\nBut Clinton was of the South, Southern. “We are the best friends of the Negroes,” said the white people; “of course, they are our servants and must stay in their place.” And so, as they prospered, the Dendys were watched closely for the first signs of “uppishness.” But with consummate tact and judgment they avoided touching the sore spots of the sensitive Southerners. Except in one place. They educated their children. William was sent away to school, then to college, to medical school. When he had become a practising physician in a Northern city their white neighbors were reluctantly proud of him, uneasily admiring. Robert, the second son, also went North when he had finished college, and rumors of his success in New York City reached the home town—rumors pleasantly substantiated when, on his later visits he made extensive purchases from the home town merchants.\nViola was perhaps the most popular of all among the white folk. She, pretty and earnest, introduced her favorite subject of home economics in the colored school. By her own persuasive efforts she got the support of the banker who furnished funds for adequate equipment, and of other white people.\nAnd so on. Three of the other Dendy children are now teaching in high schools. One, disabled in the war, is in a military hospital. Then there was Norris.\n \nNorris had inherited his mother’s high spirits without her sagacity, his father’s intelligence without his caution. Brighter than most, he could “outsmart” the white boys. Unwillingly they recognized this and their resentment grew and smoldered. Sullenly they saw him go away to school, indignant, even though many of them had left school by their own preference, or through sheer boredom. It was inappropriate that he should go to college while they stayed at home. He went first to State College in South Carolina then to Virginia Union University. Then he came home.\nIn 1924 Mr. and Mrs. Dendy decided to build a new house, a comfortable home, large enough for the children, now grown, to return to for family reunions. They selected the location and bought a lot, not on one of the straggling, ill-kept lanes of the colored section, but in a good block on the outskirts of the town, on a well lighted street where improvements were available. There were white homes just a block away. They chose the place from no false pride or snobbishness, but from a desire for the simple comfort of sanitation. When the framework was up, showing the size of the structure, the house became the chief topic of conversation at the dinner tables of the town. Discussion went on furiously. The “best people” approved, openly expressed their approval; but from the “cracker” class came violent indignation—jealous indignation, because the Dendys’ new house was a two-story house, as good as a white man’s; better than many of theirs.\nOne morning Mr. Dendy received a letter, anonymous and bearing at the top a crudely drawn skull and crossbones.\n\n“You look good to us,” it read. “If you build a house down there this is what you get you better build your house up where the rest of the dam niggers live. You getting too dam rich to be a nigger. That dam manish boy of yours will die soon.”\n“We are only giving you a warning.”\n“We want to see a nigger stay in his place.”\nThe “manish boy” was Norris. Mr. Dendy went quietly on with his building, watchfully alert. Public sentiment swayed to his side and nothing happened. Only, from that time Norris became an object of persecution. The crowd of boot-legging, petty politicians who were gradually coming to control the town were out to “get” him. The very presence of this self-reliant boy, well-dressed, educated and intelligent, was an affront to the inferior whites. Twice he was framed on a charge of receiving stolen goods. Without evidence he was convicted in the local court and acquitted on appeal. He had a good lawyer, the best, it was said, in the county. Things had come to a pretty pass when a nigger could hire him a lawyer and win his case in the white man’s court. “He’s too smart,” they grumbled. “His daddy got too much money for a nigger.” They arrested him on other charges and with each acquittal (he never was convicted) their rancor grew.\nOn the fourth of July, 1933, the colored people of Clinton had a picnic at Lake Murray. Norris drove one truck-load of picnickers and Marvin Lollis, a white man, drove another. Late in the afternoon a dispute arose between Norris and the white man on the subject, it is said, of the relative merits of the trucks they were driving. The argument grew heated, culminating in a verbal outburst from Lollis to which Norris replied by striking him on the mouth.\n \nThe rest of the story is brief. The excuse for which they had been waiting was furnished. Rushing back to town on his truck Norris was met and arrested by officers and placed in the local jail—two cells at the back of the police station. His young wife and his mother came to see him but could not get him released. Men began to gather about the building. By nine o’clock a mob filled the police station and cars lined the street outside. The arrival of a man with a coil of rope was the signal for someone to unlock the cell, and the struggle began. Norris was a powerful man and no coward, but finally he was overpowered and bound. His mother stood outside, his baby in her arms, her frantic pleadings in vain, as they threw him in a car and drove away. Somebody knocked her down and all she remembers after that is the line of cars speeding past the Methodist church.\nNext day the body was officially “discovered” a few miles out of town. He had been half-strangled before they beat him to death.\nClinton—white Clinton—has had its revenge: Mr. and Mrs. Dendy, in their spacious home, go drearily about the day’s routine. Perhaps it is as well for them that they have Amanda, Norris’ girl-widow, and her babies to provide for. The sympathy of their friends, white and colored, brings small comfort. A life-time of exemplary behavior could not protect their boy from the white savage.\n“What was the use?” ponders Mrs. Dendy as she mechanically rocks the baby. Everywhere oppressed Negroes echo, “What is the use?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Fruit of the Tree (1913)\nFor What (1919)\nOptimism (1929)\nAbout Wailing (1930)\nClothes (1920)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1933. “Too Rich to Be a Nigger.”\nThe Crisis 40 (12): 282–83. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/40/12/too_rich.html."

    "text": "What is to become of the secondary and higher Negro schools that are not smiled upon by the ring of rich philanthropists represented by the General Education Board and like agencies? These excluded schools are undoubtedly in many cases poorly equipped and indifferently managed. At the same time they are doing and have done the real work of the education of the Negro race. Their accomplishment both in volume and in real efficient result has been ten times that of Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes for the simple reason that they outnumber these schools 100 to 1 and deal with by far the greater number of the children of ten millions.\nInstead then of being sneered at and discouraged, they ought to be encouraged, and it is little less than a shame that the United States government with the aid of Thomas Jesse Jones is (as we are assured) about to issue a definitive report recommending all sorts of things tending to extinguish these struggling institutions.\nWe are glad, however, that the National Training School, of Durham, North Carolina, despite this handicap, has paid her debt and has just held a conference of far-reaching importance on the subject of Negro education. Representatives of Negroes, South and North, and of white men, North and South, were on the program and all the visitors were firmly impressed with the wide influence of this school as a center of good work and with the indefatigable work of her president.\nIn the same way Atlanta University, long frowned upon because she persistently stood for the bigger things, is trying to raise on her fiftieth anniversary, a fund of $500,000. No school in the South has done a work for Negro uplift that can for a moment be compared with that of Atlanta University.\nFisk University, which has fortunately reached the edge of the approval of Organized Philanthropy, asks for a conservatory of music in memory of the Fisk Jubilee Singers. The response to this appeal should be immediate and generous and should come from black people and white. We must rally to the defense of our schools. We must repudiate this unbearable assumption of the right to kill institutions unless they conform to one narrow standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNegro Education (1918)\nEducation (1911)\nThe Negro Public School (1916)\nEmployment (1932)\nPublic Schools (1916)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1917. “Schools.” The Crisis 13\n(3): 111–12. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/13/03/schools.html."

    "text": "An interesting exchange of letters has appeared in the New York Nation in which a Canadian has taken the South severely to task for lynching and for its pretended excuses for lynching. A Texan has hotly replied that the culture of the South must not be accused of dishonesty nor made responsible for southern barbarities. To which the Canadian replies: “If editors, preachers, lawyers, teachers, indeed, all the professional classes, and all business men of consequence, are as genuinely indignant as your correspondent supposes, the influence of these persons must be painfully small. And unfortunately it is the common man who counts. It is he who determines the selection of a governor. It is he whose pressure upon the administration decides whether or not the majesty of the law shall be protected. It is he who pours petroleum upon the body of an unpopular Negro. And the whole point of my contention was that the common man of Georgia or Texas has a very different feeling towards the lyncher from that of common men elsewhere.”\nThis brings out the real dilemma of those who would interpret the present South. Is the South a land of barbarism leavened with culture, or a land of culture leavened with barbarism? If we accept the former explanation we can explain lynching. It is a barbaric outburst and survival, and against it the better elements of the South are gradually making headway and gaining strength. But they are not yet strong enough to overcome it. Yet this rational explanation makes the Southerners furious. “No!” they yell, “The South is a center of culture and civilization. It is really one of the most civilized parts of the globe. It is ‘pure’ in its blood and ideals and suited and able to lead the world.” But, if this is so, what about lynching and lawlessness? What sort of a culture is it that cannot control itself in the most fundamental of human relations, that is given over to mobs, reactionary legislation and cruel practices?\nThat the “culture” of the South is thus shot through with barbarism can easily be proven. A white woman, whose letter the Columbia State feels compelled to publish, gives the following reasons for the lynching of a wealthy colored man: She does not believe in lynching, but (1) Crawford would not let certain classes of Negroes enter his house; (2) Crawford hired Negroes who were working for white people; (3) Crawford was “insolent” toward whites; (4) Negroes in general had their pockets full of money and would not work; (5) That for the above reasons this lynching may have “prevented some more serious trouble.”\nA letter from a white man in New Kent, Va., to the Richmond Times-Dispatch says: “How would they like to have their wives and daughters out in the cotton fields? Somebody must do the work and the Negro is fitted by nature for it. All the rough manual labor in the South, and much in the North, is done by him. No white man will do it if he can possibly avoid it; and education totally unfits anybody for it.”\nWe ask in all honesty. Does the thing which the South calls culture, and yet which stands for sentiments like those above, represent really a modern, civilized community? Is it not rather true that the former slave states stand today at least three hundred years behind the civilized world in all essential social and economic thought? And that outside of a very few progressive whites, their only really modern, forward-looking class is the educated Negro?\n\nCitation: Du Bois, W.E.B. 1917. “Civilization in the South.” The Crisis. 13(5):215–216.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Moral Void (1917)\nDeception (1916)\nThe Newest South (1913)\nA Statement (1919)\nRadicals (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1917. “Civilization in the South.”\nThe Crisis 13 (5): 215–16. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/13/05/civilization_in_south.html."

A telegram to Tuskegee has brought the full text just as we go to press.\nThe southern white papers assert editorially and in their news columns that the chief burden of the Tuskegee resolutions is advice to the Negro not to migrate from the South. From this advice, it goes without saying, that the Crisis absolutely dissents. On the other hand, certain spokesmen for Tuskegee assert that the resolutions simply deprecate any mass movement of Negro labor and call for better treatment on the part of the South.\nAs a matter of fact, the Tuskegee resolutions may be thus analyzed: out of fifteen inches of printed matter the following subjects are treated:\nThe Boll-Weevil and Floods, one inch; “Advice to remain in the South,” five inches; “Diversified Farming,” one and one-half inches; “A Plea to the South in Behalf of the Negro,” two and one-half inches; “Lack of Enforcement of the Law,” one-half inch; “Congratulating the South and Urging Co-operation of Races,” three and one-half inches.\nWith the subject matter of the various resolutions we have no quarrel. In few cases do we dissent from the statements, taken by themselves; but we do solemnly believe that any system of Negro leadership that today devotes ten times as much space to the advantages of living in the South as it gives to lynching and lawlessness is inexcusably blind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAn Open Letter to Robert Russa Moton (1916)\nThe Newest South (1913)\nLynchings (1932)\nRadicals (1919)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1917. “The Tuskegee Resolutions.”\nThe Crisis 13 (5): 219. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/13/05/tuskegee_resolutions.html."

(2) It is the first duty of any person, black or white, to know the attitude of candidates on matters affecting his interests before he votes for or against them. (3) Whenever any man is voting for a candidate whose beliefs and intentions he does not know, that voter not only acts the part of a fool, but he endangers the very foundations of republican government.

    "text": "We seem to hear four voices screaming above the mobs of Memphis and East St. Louis—Why will Negroes be Scabs, Why will Negroes Stay in the South, How Can We Stop Negro Migration, Where Can Negroes Be Treated Justly?\nWe believe we can answer all these questions and for the first we quote a letter of Charles Augustono, a colored bricklayer of Camden, N. J.:\n\nI am a member of the Bricklayer, Mason and Plasterers’ International Union of America. On May 10, 1917, I was at Glassboro, N.J., to a job contracted by James Steward Company of New York City and secured a position there. I started work at 12:30 P. M. The steward on the job demanded my working card. He looked it over and O. K.’d it, notifying me to pay privilege dues of thirty-five cents as my card was from another local farm, 37 Easton, Pa., Transfer No. 9 of Trenton, N. J. This job is controlled by Union No. 7 of Camden, N. J., B.M. and P.I.U. of America.\nWhen I started to work the rest of the members of the job stopped and refused to work with me. Then the boss handed me my discharge, telling me the men would not work with me, after I had showed the steward a good finance card. The trouble is that I have paid for my rights and am not getting them on account of my color. As you know, color always keeps us from making the living we ought to make.\n\nIt is this attitude of many labor unions and Northern working men who make the mobs of East St. Louis, that keeps many Negroes living among Memphis lynchers. But it cannot keep them all. The stream of migration is large. It is going to be larger. The hand of the government can be depended on in East St. Louis to put down mobs; it cannot be depended on in Memphis. If, then, the South wants Negro workingmen, as the Savannah Morning News says: “The one sure way to keep them in the South is to accord them better treatment.” If it wants food raised in the South it must support agricultural education among Negroes. Yet, as the Colored Workers’ Conference at Fort Valley recently said to the state officials:\n\nIt must be known to you, gentlemen, that if the white people need an agricultural school in each of the Congressional districts of Georgia, Negroes who operate half the farms in Georgia, who live in a greater per cent of the population in the country, and who furnish 85 per cent of the farm labor in Georgia, must need such agricultural training a great deal more. Still, regardless of this greater need and regardless of the fact that the support of these eleven white schools comes out of the general coffers of the state to which Negroes contribute in taxes, not one dollar does the state give to such agricultural education for Negroes.\n\nIt is characteristic of Georgia to call on the Federal Government to stop migration and for other Southerners to suggest that Negroes drafted for military service be put to farm work.\nWe warn the South that any attempt to draft the Negroes into the employ of private persons will be disastrous and we call the attention of the U. S. Government to the monstrous discrimination which it is permitting in Charleston, S. C.\nCharleston is a city noted for the efficiency of its colored seamstresses. Yet, recently, when the Navy Yard called for 1,000 seamstresses it sought and still seeks to discriminate against colored women.\nIt is lynching, forced labor, and discrimination that is sending the Negro North. When he comes North he may find mobs and hostile labor unions, but he will also find the law and the law will be enforced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEast St. Louis (1917)\nBrothers, Come North (1920)\nThe Migration (1917)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nA Crusade (1914)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1917. “Memphis or East St. Louis?”\nThe Crisis 14 (3): 113–14. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/14/03/memphis_or_east_st_louis.html."

    "text": "On the afternoon of Saturday July 28, a vast body of Negroes marched through the streets of New York in silent protest against the recent race riots and outrages. The New York American says:\n\nIn silent protest against the recent killing of Negroes in race riots in Waco, Memphis and East St. Louis, 15,000 Negroes marched here yesterday afternoon. The parade formed in Fifth avenue and marched from Fifty-seventh street to Madison Square.\n\nPlacards carried by boy scouts, aged men and by women and children explained the purpose of the demonstration.\n\nA detailed account of the causes for which the parade was held is given as follows by the New York Times:\n\nDuring the progress of the march circulars were distributed among the crowds telling of the purpose which brought the Negroes together. Under the caption, “Why Do We March?” the circular read, in part, as follows:\n\nWe march because by the grace of God and the force of truth the dangerous, hampering walls of prejudice and inhuman injustices must fall.\n\nWe march because we want to make impossible a repetition of Waco, Memphis, and East St. Louis by arousing the conscience of the country, and to bring the murderers of our brothers, sisters and innocent children to justice.\n\nWe march because we deem it a crime to be silent in the face of such barbaric acts.\n\nWe march because we are thoroughly opposed to Jim Crow cars, etc., segregation, discrimination, disfranchisement, lynching, and the host of evils that are forced on us. It is time that the spirit of Christ should be manifested in the making and execution of laws.\n\nWe march because we want our children to live in a better land and enjoy fairer conditions than have fallen to our lot.\n\nWe march in memory of our butchered dead, the massacre of honest toilers who were removing the reproach of laziness and thriftlessness hurled at the entire race. They died to prove our worthiness to live. We live in spite of death shadowing us and ours. We prosper in the face of the most unwarranted and illegal oppression.\n\nWe march because the growing consciousness and solidarity of race, coupled with sorrow and discrimination, have made us one; a union that may never be dissolved in spite of shallow-brained agitators, scheming pundits and political tricksters who secure a fleeting popularity and uncertain financial support by promoting the disunion of a people who ought to consider themselves as one.\n\nAlthough the paraders marched by in silence their sentiments were proclaimed by many mottoes, a complete list of which follows:\n\n\nMemphis and Waco—Centers of American Culture?\n\nAlabama needs 75,000 Ballots to elect 10 Congressmen. Minnesota needs 300,000. How do they do it?\n\n350,000 voters in the South have as much political power as the 1,500,000 voters of New York State. How do they do it?\n\nEach white man in the South by disfranchising the black working man casts from 3 to 13 times as many ballots as You.\n\nGeorgia and New Jersey have the same vote for President. Georgia casts 80,000 votes; New Jersey casts 430,000.\n\n\nMake America safe for Democracy.\n\nTaxation without representation is tyranny.\n\nThou shalt not kill.\n\nThou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\n\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. That among these are LIFE, LIBERTY and the pursuit of HAPPINESS.\n\n\nIf you are of African descent tear off this corner.\n\n\nAmerica has lynched without trial 2,867 Negroes in 31 years and not a single murderer has suffered.\n\n\n200,000 black men fought for your liberty in the Civil War.\n\nThe first blood for American Independence was shed by a Negro—Crispus Attucks.\n\n\nWe have fought for the liberty of white Americans in 6 wars; our reward is East St. Louis\n\n\n12,000 of us fought with Jackson at New Orleans.\n\n\nThe Negro Silent Parade, at Forty-Second street and Fifth avenue, New York City.

    "text": "There is in Paris a place where once a notorious prison stood—the Bastille. For many years from the beginning of its erection in 1369, it lowered, a stronghold of cruelty and despotism. But on one marvelous fourteenth of July, 1789, it was stormed by a furious and desperate populace, and not a stone is left to indicate what once had been. Instead, now on that spot, a lofty column, the Column of July, rears skyward its slender, beautiful length, a carven oriflamme of that liberty, fraternity and equality which is in verity the pride of France.\nAnd so the Bastille perished. Moreover the key was brought to America and tendered by Lafayette to General Washington in gracious recognition by one democracy of another. But here the similarity between the two countries ceases. For since the fall of the French stronghold there has been building in this democracy a tower, a fortress fully as iniquitous in its purpose as the ill-famed Bastille of old. Throughout the length and breadth of this land, yes, in the Nation’s very capital, are men bent on putting the crowning touch of infamy to this new and monstrous superstructure—the Black Bastille of Prejudice. How many victims have been thrust into its pitiless confines! Into it have gone the ideals of the Pilgrim Fathers, the dreams of the Abolitionists and President Lincoln, and during the week before the fourteenth of July—the very anniversary of the fall of its stone and mortar prototype—the democracy of a nation! The shadow of the Black Bastille lies always across the path of us Americans. Turn where we will we cannot escape its gloom. In those old unhappy, far-off days the French populace demolished their Bastille’s frowning reality with every conceivable weapon, stones, maces, pick-axes, halberds and their poor naked hands. America’s course must be as theirs. We have no choice but to bring to the annihilation of this structure—so insubstantial and yet so real our all—determination, effort—grim, unceasing—money, time, tears, our naked bleeding hearts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nReturning Soldiers (1919)\nAn Essay Toward a History of the Black Man in the Great War (1919)\nTo Mr. Emmett Scott (1919)\nThe Massacre in East St. Louis (1917)\nThe Black Man in the Revolution of 1914-1918 (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1917. “The Black Bastille.”\nThe Crisis 14 (5): 217. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/14/05/black_bastille.html."

    "text": "We spoke last month of the great call for team work on the part of American Negroes and the pressing necessity of turning that team work toward helping us to earn a living.\nToday the way is open for co-operation among 12,000,000 people on a scale such as we have never dreamed. What we can do is shown in little things. Ten thousand of us marched the other day in New York City. Everybody said it could not be done. The ways were lined with rabbits, afraid even to walk for freedom, and yet, solemnly and simply, the Negroes of New York told the other citizens of New York their grief and resentment. That is but a little thing. We can do infinitely more. We can organize for industrial co-operation and we can begin with co-operation in distribution. In every large city where 10,000 or more Negroes live, the business of buying groceries, food, clothing and fuel can, by a single determined effort, be put into the hands of colored people. This kind of distribution has been successful all over the world. Little is said about it because the leeches that have fattened on retail trade are too powerful with the newspapers. Distribution of the necessities of life can be easily done with a tremendous saving to the people and the employment of colored men and women. The only thing necessary is for us to start; and to start we simply require that the same spirit of devotion and sacrifice, coupled with brains and training, that has sent young men and women to the ministry and the Y.M. and Y.W.C.A. work should be turned now among us Negroes and be put into business.\nWhite people are not in business for their health.

    "text": "The representatives of Negro organizations embracing many millions of men, together with their friends and fellow workers of other races, deem it fitting at this critical time in the history of our country and the world to express the attitude and aspirations which they think fitting for the twelve million Americans of Negro descent and for many other millions resident in America, in Africa, and in the islands of the sea.\nWe trace the real cause of this world war to the despising of the darker races by the dominant groups of men, and the consequent fierce rivalry among European nations in their effort to use darker and backward people for purposes of selfish gain regardless of the ultimate good of the oppressed.\nWe see permanent peace only in the extension of the principle of government by the consent of the governed, not simply among the smaller nations of Europe but among the natives of Asia and Africa, the Western Indies and the Negroes of the United States.\nDespite the unfortunate record of England, of Belgium, and of our own land in dealing with colored peoples, we earnestly believe that the greatest hope for ultimate democracy, with no adventitious barriers of race and color, lies on the side of the Allies, with whom our country has become companion in arms. In justification of this belief we point on the one hand to the splendid democracy of France, the recent freeing of our fellow-sufferers in Russia, and the slow but steady advance of principles of universal justice in the British Empire and in our own land; and on the other hand we point to the wretched record of Germany in Africa and her preachment of autocracy and race superiority.\nWe, therefore, earnestly urge our colored fellow citizens to join heartily in this fight for eventual world liberty; we urge them to enlist in the army; to join in the pressing work of providing food supplies; to labor in all ways by hand and thought in increasing the efficiency of our country. We urge this despite our deep sympathy with the reasonable and deep-seated feeling of revolt among Negroes at the persistent insult and discrimination to which they are subject and will be subject even when they do their patriotic duty.\nLet us, however, never forget that this country belongs to us even more than to those who lynch, disfranchise, and segregate. As our country it rightly demands our whole-hearted defense as well today as when with Crispus Attucks we fought for independence and with 200,000 black soldiers we helped hammer out our own freedom.\nAbsolute loyalty in arms and in civil duties need not for a moment lead us to abate our just complaints and just demands. Despite the gratuitous advice of the white friends who wish us to submit uncomplainingly to caste and peonage, and despite the more timid and complacent souls in our own ranks, we demand and of right ought to demand:\n\nThe right to serve our country on the battlefield and to receive training for such service;\nThe right of our best men to lead troops of their own race in battle, and to receive officers’ training in preparation for such leadership;\nThe immediate stoppage of lynching;\nThe right to vote for both men and women;\nUniversal and free common school training;\nThe abolition of Jim Crow cars;\nThe repeal of segregation ordinances;\nEqual civil rights in all public institutions and movements.\n\nThese are not minor matters. They are not matters that can wait. They are the least that self-respecting, free, modern men can have and live. In asking these rights we pretend to no extraordinary desert. We are ordinary men, trained in ignorance, forced sometimes to crime, kept in poverty. Yet even so, we have blazed a great red trail to freedom, stained with our blood and sweat and a proof of our earnestness. Modern political and social rights are not rewards of merit. They are measures of protection and prerequisites to uplift. The denial of them is death and that our enemies and some of our false friends well know.\nLet our action, then, include unfaltering loyalty to our country, unbounded effort toward realizing the larger, finer objects of this world battle of America and her allies; simultaneous with this and in further, stronger determination to realize world peace and self-government, let us insist that neither the world nor America can be happy and democratic so long as twelve million Americans are lynched, disfranchised, and insulted—so long as millions of other darker folk are exploited and killed.\nIn earnest confirmation of this thought and action, we call on the twelve million Negro Americans to unite with us in a great and solemn festival beginning in August, 1919, which will be three hundred years after the permanent settlement of Negroes on the American mainland. On that occasion, without exultation in the beginning of a shameful slavery, but with thankfulness for the partial fall of its shackles, let us meet and think and rejoice and solemnly resolve on the threshold of our fourth century in America to go forward toward Freedom without hesitation or compromise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nJust Like—Folks (1920)\nThe Present (1917)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\nInter-Racial Comity (1922)\nThe Strength of Segregation (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1917. “Resolutions of the Washington\nConference.” The Crisis 14 (2): 59–60. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/14/02/resolutions.html."

Liars tell us that only white men can lead black men, and they tell us this in the face of the record of Sonni Ali, Touissaint L’Ouverture, General Dodd, Charles Young, and Frank Dennison. Give us Negro officers for Negro troops.\nJustice and right calls for the admission of Negroes to the civilian training camps on the same terms as white men. This right the Crisis and Dr. Spingarn demanded from the first and we were refused.\nAs the next best thing, Dr. Spingarn said: “If colored men cannot be admitted to Plattsburg and similar camps give them a camp of their own.”\nThe Crisis advocated and strongly advocated this alternative. Moreover, the Crisis wonders how on earth the wild and dapper advocates of “Jim Crow” regiments can somersault into opponents of the training of Negro officers in separate camps?\nDo they want “Jim Crow” regiments? No, but they want black soldiers and they accept separate regiments rather than forego military training. Do Dr. Spingarn and Dr. Du Bois and thousands of level-headed colored folk want a “Jim Crow” training camp? No, but they want black officers and they advocate a separate camp rather than see Negro regiments officered solely by white men.\nHow easily some of us are beguiled. We are assured that the General Staff will not refuse Negro troops. It may not, but there is every evidence that it intended to in the plan drafted previous to the declaration of war which did not become law. We are told to “wait” for our camp until after all white officers are trained, and some colored papers actually rejoice at this, unable to grasp the clear fact that once enough whites are trained for all regiments, no Negroes need apply.\nWhere in heaven’s name do we Negroes stand? If we organize separately for anything—“Jim Crow!” scream all the Disconsolate; if we organize with white people—“Traitors! Pressure! They’re betraying us!” yell all the Suspicious. If, unable to get the whole loaf we seize half to ward off starvation—“Compromise!” yell all the Scared. If we let the half loaf go and starve—“Why don’t you do something?” yell those same critics, dancing about on their toes.\nIt is simply silly to talk about pressure being brought to bear on the editor of the Crisis or on anyone else to back this demand. The only “pressure” brought is the pressure of common sense. Mr. Storey, Mr. Villard, Dr. Spingarn, Mr. Loud, Mr. Kennaday, Mr. Russell, Mr. Walling, Miss Ovington, and Mr. Nash and dozens of other white men are working shoulder to shoulder in the NAACP with us black men and treating us as comrades in a great fight for human rights. It is beneath contempt for the Cleveland, Ohio, Gazette to suggest that their motives are not above suspicion or that the editor of the Crisis has ever been asked by them to advocate that which he did not sincerely believe was right. Just now we demand Negro officers for Negro regiments. We cannot get them by admission to the regular training camps because the law of the land, or its official interpretation, wickedly prevents us. Therefore, give us a separate training camp for Negro officers.\nLATER: We have won! The camp is granted; we shall have 1,000 Negro officers in the United States Army!

But the effective way to beat the “white primary” is through registering and voting on the part of the colored South. In Columbia, S.C., recently some six hundred Negroes registered. Immediately the dominant oligarchy became seared. “What do you want?” they asked, expecting a demand for a bribe. “We want,” said the colored voters after careful consultation, “a new high school building.” They got not only a fifty thousand dollar high school but one hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of improvements in their streets; What was done in Columbia is possible all over the South. The Negro must work not only for his own uplift, but he can work for the uplift of the whole South, especially when the white politicians seek to force upon cities and states men whom it would be shameful to put in public office. In Atlanta, Ga., the white nominee for mayor several years ago was a notorious drunkard who was arrested in a bawdy house just before election. It was Negro votes that put a decent mayor in his place despite the “white primary.” The colored women of Arkansas have the chance of their lives. The legislature has given the vote to women “in the primary elections.” They expect only white women to vote in the Democratic primary; but a Republican primary should be organized forthwith, and colored women should vote in it. Some one should apply at the Democratic primary and if refused should take the matter to the courts. It is the chance of a lifetime.

Recently, for instance, the press of the country went wild over the brave action of Governor Stanley of Kentucky. What then? This same Governor Stanley is apparently going to allow the rescued victim of that mob to be lynched by court under forms of law. There would seem to be no reasonable doubt but that Lube Martin killed Guthrie Diuguid in self-defense after Diuguid had followed him for a year and sworn to kill him.\nYet Martin is sentenced to death and the Governor dares not raise his voice. So too in South Carolina. A man is lynched because he is a self-respecting, wealthy Negro citizen who refuses to let a dirty mob publicly whip him. Governor Manning makes brave professions and sends them out through the associated press yet to-day every single lyncher is free and unindicted. The Governor does nothing and will do nothing. How different is the tale at Lima, Ohio! There a mob attempted to lynch a Negro but was foiled by the brave sheriff. The ring leaders of the mob were arrested and the sheriff writes us:\n\nWe have one serving time in the Ohio Penitentiary, three serving time in the Mansfield Reformatory, one locked up in Ottawa Jail waiting return of Court of Appeals, one out on $1,500 bond waiting answer from Court of Appeals, for a new trial, several that we could not get the strongest of evidence against that came in and pleaded guilty that got suspended sentences by paving costs which amounted anywhere from $25 to $50, and are under our watch for one year to see that they don’t drink and do anything bad, and we surely have our eyes on them and will continue so. locked in the county jail yet awaiting his trial, several to try yet, and about four who were indicted that we have not been able to locate yet.

    "text": "In the patois of his very religious speech the Negro is about to lose the real significance of a fine word—Consecration; and back of it all a finer idea. As it is, we have come to look upon consecration as a negative, spineless, namby-pamby thing, the incarnation of the “mustn’t” idea, the fear of the “Thou shalt not.” The consecration that is needed today has all the thunders of “Thou shalt.” It is action, doing, deeds. Better in this awful era of bitter want that we should sin by over-action, by overdoing, rather than die by the cowardice of inertia.\nLook upon these little faces that broider our pages. Think of the millions that are not here—just as lovely and alluring—and remember that it is our present business to write in on the souls that look through these dark eyes wishes, wills, determinations, consecration.\nBut consecration to what? Not to religion, because religion is a method and not a thing. Not to one particular kind of work, but rather to the work that leads to things of greatest importance, the work for which the universe today pants. That work is business, industry, the making and fashioning of things. Consecration to business must be the slogan that follows the present outburst of Hell, else civilization is doomed.\nThe first duty of man is to earn a living. The earning of a living today is business and industry. Unless we put unselfish, consecrated men into the doing of this work, we turn it over to thieves and scoundrels. If sharpers and gamblers run the business and industry of the world, the result is the crop of mad jealousies that have made this present war. Consecration to business, then, must be the work of the future.\nWe must go into business for our health. We must oust the idea of selfish gain. We must try to teach the nations to earn a living by honesty, by efficiency, and along the paths of beauty. We can do this only by means of the children. The fine ideal of the Socialistic state is absolutely impossible until we get the consecrated business man. So long as business is in the hands of social scoundrels whose business ideal is to be millionaires, just so long modern industrial organization will always find itself impossible, will always end in chaos. Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and let the little children enter. Children upon whose hearts we who know, we who have suffered hatred, degradation and poverty, we, the people of the future democracy, have written—Consecrated to Business.\nDoes the ideal sound cheap?

    "text": "Graceful interlude at Detroit was the quite unexpected presentation of a loving cup to Miss Ovington, Chairman of the Board, and of a travelling bag to the Secretary, Mr. Johnson, as a token of appreciation by the Branches of their work for the Association.\nThe writer has spent all his life working for boards—boards of trustees, boards of directors and committees—during which time he himself has usually been a member of some board, some committee or some faculty. He appreciates vividly, therefore, the advantages and disadvantages and the difficulties of this mode of human government, for such it is. In the future, in increasing degree, industry, social control and political government are going to be carried on by this method of democracy, and perhaps we ought to be more seriously preparing for it and adjusting our canons of praise and blame; especially when it is as conspicuously successful as in the case of the N.A.A.C.P. and its two chief executive officers, Miss Ovington and Mr. Johnson.\nWe should examine the reasons for success and the pitfalls of failure. Board members rather easily and obviously differentiate themselves into the quite careless and the over-zealous classes. The one regards his membership on the board as an indiscretion or a joke; the other mistakes himself for the executive officer whom the board is supposed to control.\nIf the board inclines to the first type and the executive officer is strong and resourceful, your organization becomes a kind of successful monarchy with the board as a sort of honorary Privy Council. In the other case the executive officer becomes a chief clerk and the board a real executive, working usually through committees. However successful this method may be for a time, it suffers from lack of continuity in policy, lack of foresight, and it usually ends in the rather curt dismissal of the unoffending executive officer.\nBetween these extremes stretch the usual boards of directors, and the success of the organization depends upon the relationship that comes to be established between the board and its executives.\nMost often the board fails in efficiency because through absences different boards really meet in the different months and, with curious insouciance, one meeting will inaugurate a policy which the other meeting will entirely overturn. Or again, boards naturally dislike responsibility and indeed can only with difficulty carry responsibility, especially for the raising of funds and the laying down of principles and future lines of work. They are apt to fail in prescience, in the far look ahead and especially in their reception of new and unusual ideas. They naturally seek quickly a fixed program of work and a routine.\nOpposed to these tendencies, in a sense, stand the executives, and, because they are thus opposed, their position and tenure of office are apt to be in jeopardy. They see through a thousand eyes new calls, new changes, new ideas, exceedingly difficult to explain in the routine of an hour’s meeting. They find responsibilities thrust upon them which they dare not evade and yet have insufficient power to bear; however, out of all this, if the organization is successful, there comes the kind of balance which is the ideal of real democracy; an executive trusted, free within wide bounds, unhampered and yet in the end controlled by sympathetic men of less technical but more general knowledge than the executives, who are kept in constant touch with his problems and form real counselors, willing at his word to assume even great personal responsibility.\nFor some such accomplishment as this the loving cup was given “To Mary White Ovington, Chairman of the Board of Directors, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, from the Branches in token of their love for her and in appreciation of her loyal and courageous service to the cause of Social Justice and Democracy.”\nMiss Ovington’s task has been doubly difficult because she is white, a woman, and an unsalaried worker. It is becoming difficult for colored and white people to work together in the modern world because they are beginning to meet upon a different plane. The old plane of Giver and Beggar, while still with us, is passing in its dominance and significance. The new plane of equal social co-worker is hard to establish, because, on the one hand, it is difficult for any white person born in America to think of the Negro as his equal, and on the other hand, it is difficult for a Negro to approach a white person without suspicion and bad manners.\nAdd to this the fact that men do not easily work with women as equals, that the usual volunteer worker is anathema in a real executive office, and Miss Ovington’s accomplishment in the last few years has been extraordinary.\nMr. Johnson’s work calls for no less praise. Trained as a poet and literary man, but turned in his manhood to important diplomatic work for his country, he found himself in the midst of life suddenly checked in his career because of the race prejudice of the politically dominant South. With the somewhat uneasy acquiescence of his friends and the criticism of others, he then took up an executive work involving tedious details, constant attendance and hard labor. He did this too in succession to one of the best trained social workers in the United States, and at a time of collapse and reconstruction throughout the world. To have pulled the N.A.A.C.P. through this morass into a higher and stronger position was an accomplishment deserving the highest praise. In addition to this, Mr. Johnson has kept up his literary work and accomplished a piece of diplomacy in Haiti which stands as one of the greatest single achievements done in colored America.\nLoving cups and travelling bags are very little things, but they mean a lot to the servants of boards of directors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nA Quarter Million (1921)\nCredit (1915)\nOur Special Grievances (1918)\nThe Present (1917)\nFifteen Years (1924)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “Of Boards.” The Crisis 22\n(5): 197–98. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/05/boards.html."

It is a singular comment upon our newspapers to know that exactly the opposite is true. Never before was Socialism so widespread and so powerful. Today Socialists rule Russia, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Jugo-Slavia, Italy, France, and Belgium. In nearly every other leading nation they are strong, except in the United States and Japan.\nThis, of course, brings up the question as to what is meant by Socialism and here is room for intricate argument. But in general one means to say by Socialism the assertion by the community of its right to control business and industry; the denial of the old assumption that public business can ever be a private enterprise. Everywhere in the world Socialism in this broad sense is dominating and it is growing fast in the United States. Quite characteristically, many of those who recognize and exploit it deny that the new idea is Socialistic and try to fasten on Socialism every crazy scheme that any radical ever advocated. Colored Americans, however, need to think straight. Business is no longer “private” and in the future will be less so. Income is increasingly a matter of public control. Democracy will succeed only in so far as it gains intelligent control of industry. This is the future which the world faces and its success is the success of civilization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe Negro and Communism (1931)\nEconomic Disenfranchisement (1930)\nKarl Marx and the Negro (1933)\nTen Years (1927)\nMarxism and The Negro Problem (1933)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “The Spread of Socialism.”\nThe Crisis 22 (5): 199–200. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/05/spread-of-socialism.html."

    "text": "Before 1914 our minds were made up and pugilism was generally discredited as a disreputable, if not immoral, occupation. We were especially strengthened in this attitude because Mr. Jack Johnson became champion heavyweight in those days. As pugilists went, he was voted a good one, good-natured and fair in his tactics, and could only be criticised for his color and his wretched taste in the matter of women. Then came the War and as a result pugilism became The Manly Art. Society and Government encouraged it and witnessed the bout of Mr. Dempsey and M. Carpentier; and then, lo! and unfortunately, Mr. Johnson appears upon the scene and our moral indignation begins again; but it is directed now not against pugilism but against Mr. Johnson, the reason being that Mr. Johnson has just come out of jail. That he was sent to Leavenworth on a technical charge which would put hundreds of thousands of Americans in the same place if the law were rigidly enforced, matters little. He must be kept from contaminating pugilism, which has grown reputable since he was incarcerated.\nAll this is rather funny now, but before America becomes a leader of civilization it must cease to be funny and our Moral Indignations must be made to square with the facts. Is it Pugilism or Color which calls for a throb of Christian Endeavor? And where is the correspondingly greater throb for lynching and mob violence? And if ministers and Sunday Schools are silent at the burning of human beings alive, how shocked and indignant can they get at the public blows of Mr. Dempsey? And if Mr. Dempsey is a gentleman who deserves the concentrated attention of the civilized world, how much less so is Mr. Johnson, and why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nDives, Mob, and Scab (1920)\nThe Black Man in the Revolution of 1914-1918 (1919)\nThirteen (1918)\nTillman (1918)\nHeroes (1919)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “About Pugilists.”\nThe Crisis 22 (5): 198–99. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/05/about_pugilists.html."

    "text": "During the last five years the N.A.A.C.P. has carried on a campaign against lynching, conducted in accordance with the most approved methods of public­ity. This campaign has been financed by philanthropists North and South, and black and white, and by wide-spread popular subscription. We have never heard any serious criticism of our campaign save, naturally, from those who oppose any effort to defend and emancipate black folk.\nOur accomplishment from all our effort may thus be summarized:\n\nInvestigated more than a score of lynchings and race riots\nKept an accurate record of lynchings\nPublished the only statistical study of lynchings ever compiled\nSent 4,462,899 copies of the Crisis to every state in the Union and to every country on the globe\nSent out hundreds of news releases. During the year of 1920 alone 131 press stories were sent out from the National Office\nHeld more than 2,000 public meetings, attended by more than 3,000,000 people, at which speak­ ers acquainted the audiences with the facts about lynchings\nSent literature on lynching, with actual photographs of lynchings and burnings at the stake, all over the civilized world\nFought successfully three notable extradition cases when attempts were made to carry colored men accused of crimes from Northern States back to sections of the South where the men would probably have been lynched\nHeld in New York City in May, 1919, a great and successful conference against lynching. The call for this conference was signed by 120 of the leading citizens of the country, 20 of them from Southern States. The number included 5 governors, 4 ex-governors, members of Congress, judges of the higher courts, members of the President’s cabinet, and other men and women prominent in the nation’s affairs\nIssued the “Address to the Nation”\nRaised and expended since 1911 in the fight against lynching $33,928.56 this amount being spent for investigations, printing and publicity of all kinds, meetings and conferences\nSecured the passage of a law in Kentucky providing for the punishment of any peace officer who allows a prisoner to be taken from him and lynched\nSecured the introduction of anti-lynching bills in both houses of Congress. For the first time the House Committee on the Judiciary reported favorably on such a bill during the second ses­sion of the 66th Congress\nPresented to committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives of Congress, through its representatives, evidence and testimony showing the necessity of a Federal law against lynching\nFurnished lawyers to defend colored men in lynching cases; secured the acquittal, for example, of 12 of 13 colored men arrested in connection with the lynchings at Duluth, Minn., in June 1920, totally disproving the charge that criminal assault on a young girl had been com­mitted by any of the three men lynched; de­ fended since October, 1919, 12 men sentenced to death and 67 to prison terms, thus preventing a legal lynching in Phillips County, Ark.\n\nIn addition to these things we have freely given help and information to other organizations, and when the colored Republican campaign committee asked the aid of our legal department in drawing an anti-lynching bill, we freely and gladly gave it.\nWe are surprised and disappointed, therefore, to receive from Perry Howard an appeal for funds to finance a new organization to push an anti-lynching bill. This move is defensible only if the methods and aims of the N.A.A.C.P. in the anti-lynching campaign were failing. But this new organization is pushing practically the same bill by identical methods.\nIs not this move, therefore, the same futile division of effort and clouding of issues which continually misleads and discourages the Negroes, and gives joy to the Bourbon South? Would not these gentlemen convince the public of their disinterested efforts if they supported established agencies and proven work rather than attempt­ ed to build on new lines and to risk all that has been gained without hope of doing more?\nThe strength of the N.A.A.C.P. has been its singleness of aim. We did not rescue Haiti in order to annex the $10,000 salary of the Haitian Minister; we are not fighting lynching in order to become Recorder of Deeds; and our promotion of business enterprise has no string on the Registry of the Treasury. This does not mean that we are unmindful of the right of competent black men to hold office,—indeed we strongly emphasize and maintain this right—but we in­sist that this is subordinate and un­ important beside our fight for freedom, and we refuse to have our most sacred right played with as pawns to official preferment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCauses of Lynching (1931)\nLynching (1914)\nLynching (1927)\nLynchings (1932)\nCrime and Lynching (1912)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1922. “Anti-Lynching Legislation.”\nThe Crisis 22 (1): 8–9. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/01/anti-lynching_legislation.html."

He has ceased to be beguiled by the silly philosophy that a voteless, spineless suppliant who owns a three-story brick house is going to command anybody’s respect.\nBut today comes the question of practical, efficient means of getting the rights which he has at last been persuaded he wants.\nInto the field have jumped a hoard of scoundrels and bubble-blowers, ready to conquer Africa, join the Russian revolution, and vote in the Kingdom of God tomorrow. It is without doubt certain that Africa will some day belong to the Africans; that steamship lines and grocery stores, properly organized and run, are excellent civilizers; and that we are in desperate need today of organized industry and organized righteousness. But what are the practical steps to these things? By yelling? By pouring out invective and vituperation against all white folk? By collecting the pennies of the ignorant poor in shovelsful and refusing to account for them, save with bombast and lies?\nOr is it reason and decency to unite on a program which says: the battle of Negro rights is to be fought right here in America; that here we must unite to fight lynching and “Jim-Crow” cars, to settle our status in the courts, to put our children in school and maintain our free ballot.\nFar from being discouraged in the light, we are daily more and more triumphant. Yesterday 1,650 Negro women voted in New Orleans. Never since 1876 have so many Negroes voted in the South as in the last election. Our fight for right has the enemy on the run. He has had to retreat to mob violence, secret and silly mummery, clumsy and hypocritical promises. Twenty-five years more of the intelligent fighting that the N.A.A.C.P. has led will make the black man in the United States free and equal.\nOur enemies know this. They are scared. They are hastening to lay down a barrage of suspicion and personal bickering. They are encouraging and advertising any and all crazy schemes, to cut and run from the hard and bloody battle here, to Africa and the South Seas. Africa needs her children, but she needs them triumphant, victorious, and not as poverty- stricken and cowering refugees.\nAre we going to be misled fools, or are we going to put a quarter of a million level-headed, determined and unwavering black men and women back of the N.A.A.C.P. to continue the battle so nobly and successfully be­ gun? Answer, black folk of America, this month!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nViolations of Property Rights (1911)\nVotes (1919)\nThe Simple Way (1913)\nDodging the Issue (1933)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1922. “The Drive.” The Crisis 22\n(1): 8. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/01/drive.html."

    "text": "We have an interesting letter from John H. Owens of Washington, which we would like to publish in full but can only note certain extracts. Mr. Owens says, in answer to the editorial in the July Crisis on “The Negro and Radical Thought”:\n\nIs there not just the bare possibility that some of the issues which you consider subordinate to your central idea (of the emancipation of the Negro) might possess the neucleus of a tangible and definite solution?\n\nThere is more than a bare possibility, and the Negro must study proposals and reforms with great care to see if they do not carry with them some help in the solution of his problem. But he must not assume that because a proposed solution settles many important human problems, for this reason it is necessarily going to settle his.\nMr. Owens continues:\n\nThe Negro group is almost a pure proletarian group,—this fact admits of no denial. Above 90 per cent. of the Negroes are unskilled, untrained workers, and unorganized. Thus it would seem that the race as a whole has less reason to be suspicious of any movement of a proletarian nature than of some scheme which offers a questionable solution for the ills of the talented minority.\n\nThe Negro has little reason to be suspicious of a proletarian movement if that movement is for the good of the proletariat; but it does not follow that all movements proposed by the proletariat themselves are for their own good. The workers of the world are, through no fault of their own, ignorant, inexperienced men. It is not for a moment to be assumed that movements into which they are drawn or which they themselves initiate are necessarily the best for them. If, however, the Negro sees a movement for the proletariat which, after careful thought and experience, he is convinced is for the good of the working class, then as a worker he is bound to give every aid to such a movement.\n\nUniversal political enfranchisement would offer no positive relief. This the Northern Negro already enjoys; yet he suffers under the burden of social, political, and economic injustices. His condition is little more to be envied than that of his Southern brother.\n\nThe vote is not a panacea. It is a means to an end. The condition of the Negro in the North because of his political power is a great deal better than the condition of the Negro in the South. He is, of course, hindered in the North by greater competition for work, while in the South certain fields are open to him. The voter, white and black, has not yet learned to control industry through his vote, but he is learning, and only through the use of the ballot is real reform in industry and industrial relations coming.\n\nDoes not the editor think that State Socialism, Communism, or even the dread dictatorship of the proletariat, offers a better solution to the problems of the proletariat than any scheme suggested by the exploiting classes,—those who profit by the present system? And since the Negro is over 90 per cent. proletarian, is it not almost logical to assume that this would also offer a better solution to this problem than anything heretofore proposed?\n\nI do decidedly think that many proposals made by Socialists and Communists and even by the present rulers of Russia would improve the world if they could be adopted; but I do not believe that such adoption can successfully come through war or force or murder, and I do not believe that the sudden attempt to impose a new industrial system and new ideas of industrial life can be successful without the long training of human beings. I believe that Socialism must be evolutionary, not in the sense that it must take 50,000 years, but in the sense that it does mean hard work for many generations. Beginnings can and should be made this minute or tomorrow or next year. It is precisely because of our present ignorance and our widespread assumptions as to profit and business that we cannot immediately change the world. It is true that those who today are sucking the industrial life blood of the nations get their chance to keep on by simply asserting that no better way is offered and present methods suit present human nature. We who suffer and believe in reform must not think that we can answer such persons successfully simply by saying that present industrial society is not in accordance with human nature. It is in accordance with human nature today, but human nature can and must and will be changed.\n\nWe are both of the opinion that the present method of control and distribution of wealth is desperately wrong. We are en rapport on the conclusion that a form of social control is inevitable. We hold this particular truth to be self-evident,—that a change must come about. But how? I think that we both may be safe in assuming that any initiative in bringing about a better distribution of wealth must be taken by those who benefit least by the present system.\n\nThe change in industrial organization must come from those who think and believe. We cannot assume that necessarily redemption is coming from those who suffer. It may come from those who enjoy the fruit of suffering, but who come to see that such enjoyment is wrong. The point that we must hold clearly is that a proposal for reform is not necessarily good and feasible simply because it comes from a laboring man, and it is not wrong and unjustifiable simply because it comes from a millionaire. It must be judged by itself and not by its source.\n\nYou ask the question: ‘How far can the colored people of the world, and the Negroes of the United States in particular, trust the working classes?’ This is a good question, and easier asked than answered. But I would like to ask further: How far can the Negroes and other dark peoples trust the exploiting Nationalists and Imperialists? Is it the English working classes that are exploiting India, sucking the very life-blood from a starving population and grinding the natives down into the desert dust in order to support English ‘gentlemen’ in idleness and luxury? Are the English, French and Belgian working classes raping Africa, taking ill-gotten gains from a trusting population? Are the working classes of America attempting to fasten the yoke of subjugation upon the neck of Santo Domingo, and stifle liberty and freedom of speech and press in Haiti? If we have cause to distrust the working classes, by what precept of example should we put faith in the specious promises of the masters?\n\nI think these questions touch the center of much modern effort and reform. I maintain that English working classes are exploiting India; that the English, French and Belgian laborers are raping Africa; that the working classes of America are subjugating Santo Domingo and Haiti. They may not be as conscious of all they are doing as their more educated masters, called Nationalists and Imperialists, but they are consciously submitting themselves to the leadership of these men; they are voluntarily refusing to know; they are systematically refusing to listen; they are blindly voting armies and navies and hidden diplomacy, regardless of the result, and while the individual white employee in Europe and America is less to be condemned than the individual capitalist for the way in which the darker nations have been treated, he can not escape his responsibility. He is co-worker in the miserable modern subjugation of over half the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Book Shelf (1926)\nBlack and White Workers (1928)\nThe Simple Way (1913)\nThe Immediate Program of the American Negro (1915)\nRadicals and the Negro (1925)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1921. “Socialism and the Negro.”\nThe Crisis 22 (6): 245–47. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/22/06/socialism_and_the_negro.html."

    "text": "Most colored folk do not yet quite understand modern advertising. They still think of advertising as a species of bribery, hush-money or charity given to newspapers to secure their support or reward their faithfulness or pay their debts.\nThere is, of course, much of this sort of “advertising” still with us and in high places. But modern advertising of the efficient sort is far beyond this. It is an effort to carry a message to those who ought to get it; to tell people who use soap, about a new, good, cheap soap; to tell people who buy clothes, where they may buy a certain kind.\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People wishes to pass the Dyer Bill. The colored people were behind them in this to a man. The mass of the whites was indifferent. We wanted to arouse the whites to the enormity—the shame and disgrace of lynching. How could we best do this?\nAfter long consideration and argument, we decided to advertise. But where? Not, most assuredly with our friends;—not with papers whose readers were converted, but we proposed to advertise in those periodicals which reached the largest number of indifferent white readers.\nWe were not advertising in order to reward our friends or punish our enemies but in order to send our message to those who ought to have it. We therefore picked our advertising media with just one aim in mind: how many people can we reach not familiar with the facts about lynching?\nWe reached at least five million readers in a day—the greatest single stroke of propaganda ever struck in behalf of justice for the Negro. The Bill was not passed but the effect of this advertisement is beyond estimate. It was copied all over the United States and in Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOur Economic Future (1928)\nThe Last Word in Politics (1912)\nTravel (1926)\nOur Economic Peril (1930)\nBlessed Discrimination (1913)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1922. “Advertising.” The Crisis 25\n(4): 152. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/25/04/advertising.html."

    "text": "On November, 1910, The Crisis was born. With this issue, November, 1922, we are completing our twelfth year and we pause to thank all those who have made our long and fairly successful career possible. We have for the future both promises and apologies. First, we want to apologize to the large number of people who subscribe indirectly to The Crisis and either do not get their subscriptions or have them delayed. It can be easily seen that this is not wholly the fault of The Crisis: The Crisis cannot fulfil a subscription until it receives it or at least receives notice that it has been paid. On the other hand, many subscriptions are taken in the drives for memberships of the N.A.A.C.P. and this has always been a great and valuable source of support for The Crisis. When, however, subscriptions are paid thus indirectly, first to a solicitor, then handed to a captain, then slowly collected by a local secretary, then forwarded to the national secretary, and finally handed to The Crisis business manager,—all this involves much delay and several possibilities of mistake. Anyone thus subscribing for The Crisis indirectly should always and simultaneously notify The Crisis office of the facts. If there is anyone who having thus subscribed has not received The Crisis we shall be only too glad to learn the facts and make all reparation.\nSo much for apology. Now to our muttons. The Crisis has always stood for Truth,—for the Truth when it is bitter, because we believe this is the only path to reform; for the Truth when it is sweet, for that heartens all. We shall continue to stand thus for the Truth. In addition to this we want to increase that part of our mission which, while not neglected, has had too little attention in the past, and that is the work of propagating and encouraging Beauty. We Negroes have gone fast forward in economic development, in political and social agitation; and we are likely to forget that the great mission of the Negro to America and the modern world is the development of Art and the appreciation of the Beautiful. The esthetic life of black folk is likely to be choked—not by toil, for they are gifted with that divine laziness that will rest and dream in spite of laws and lash and silly money; but with the over-emphasis of ethics to meet the Puritans round about who conceal their little joys and deny them with crass utilitarianism.\nWhy even our song—that vivid burst of sorrow burnt with joy—our love of life, the wild and beautiful desire of our women and men for each other—all, all this sinks to being “good” and being “useful” and being “white.”\nThe Crisis wishes by picture and drawing, by fiction, essays, poetry, by the organization of a Negro Institute of Literature and Art, to increase, nourish and encourage the Beautiful among Negroes and among Americans. As a beginning of this work for our New Year, we have the honor to announce a Christmas cover by Henry O. Tanner. And as a second step the Delta Omega Chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority at Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute, Petersburg, Va., offers through The Crisis a prize of fifty dollars for the best short story written by a Negro student.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWe Come of Age (1915)\nThe Second Birthday (1912)\nJoin or Die (1914)\nBooming The Crisis (1914)\nFifteen Years (1924)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDu Bois, W.E.B. 1922. “Truth and Beauty.”\nThe Crisis 25 (1): 7–8. https://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/25/01/truth_and_beauty.html."
