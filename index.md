&nbsp;    

W.E.B. Du Bois founded <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span>, the official journal of the NAACP, in 1910 and regularly contributed editorials and articles until 1934. This project is an ongoing effort to make available his writings from this period.

&nbsp;    


**Work in progress.** This site currently includes 408 articles, but hundreds more are in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span> archives. If you want to help make more articles available, look at our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/blob/main/contributing.md), or email [me](mailto:nealcaren@unc.edu).
