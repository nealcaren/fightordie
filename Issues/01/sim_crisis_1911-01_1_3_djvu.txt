POLITICAL, 

Objections to the proposed appointment 
of William R. Lewis, a Negro attorney of 
Boston, as an assistant attorney-general 
are being presented to Attorney-General 
Wickersham. President Taft’s intention to 
appoint Lewis was learned semi-officially 
at the White House several weeks ago. 
Booker T. Washington has called upon Mr. 
Wickersham to urge his approval of the 
appointment, and Speaker Cannon has op- 
posed it. 


President Taft said in his message: “I 
renew my recommendation that the ciaims 
of the depositors in the kreedman’s Bank 
be recognized and paid by the passage of 
the pending bill on that subject. I also 
renew my recommendation that steps be 
taken looking to the holding of a Negro 
exposition in celebration of the fiftieth an- 
niversary of the issuing by Mr. Lincoln of 
the Emancipation Proclamation.” 


There is only one feature of the appor- 
tionment matter which is apt to precipitate 
trouble, and that is the proposal to reduce 
the representation of the Southern States 
which have deprived a part of their popu- 
lation of the right of suffrage. Louisiana, 
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Caro- 
lina and other Commonwealths below the 
Mason and Dixon line have imposed re- 
strictions upon the Negroes which make it 
impossible for them to vote at any elec- 
tion—Denver Times. 


THE COURTS. 

In Richmond, Va., Judge Goff, in the 
United States Circuit Court of Appeals, 
decided that no deed conveying real 
estate could legally preclude the subsequent 
conveyance of any part of that real estate 
to persons of African descent. He held that 
any provision or clause providing that real 
estate shall net be acquired by Negroes is 
invalid and void, and that no such provision 
can be put into a deed. The case was ar- 
gued for the Negroes by George J. Hooper 
and William L. Royall. A. O. Boschen 
argued for the other side. The decision of 
Judge Goff will be appealed to the Su- 
preme Court of the United States. It is 
attracting wide attention and much com- 
ment among members of the local bar. The 
case was that of the People’s Pleasure Park 
vs. Worsham. 


Having been defeated in the Supreme 
Court of New York, and that defeat hav- 
ing been affirmed by the Appellate Division, 





the colored Order of Elks has filed an 
appeal to the Court of Appeals and has 
filed a bond of the National Surety Com- 
pany to cover the payment of any costs 
that may be awarded against it. The col- 
ored order was enjoined from using the 


name or the emblem of the white Order 
of Elks. 


The verdict of $1,000 awarded George 
W. Griffin, a Pullman car porter, against 
Daniel L. srady, brother of “Diamond 
Jim” Brady, was affirmed py the Appellate 
Division of the Supreme Court. Griffin 
was arrested by Brady on a charge of 
theft, and after proving his innocence sued 
his accuser. 


Joseph Atwater, an Oklahoma Negro, 
filed in the Supreme Court of the United 
States at Washington his appeal from the 
decision of the Oklahoma courts which had 
refused to enjoin election officials in Okla- 
homa City from denying him the right to 
vote on Nov. &th. The petition for injunc- 
tion was based on the claim that the 
“grandfather clause’ placed in the Okla- 
homa constitution by amendment was in- 
valid, because it would deny the right to 
vote to a large number of Negroes in the 
State entirely on account of color or pre- 
vious condition of servitude. 


SOCIAL UPLIFT. 

In New Orleans during the past year 
several drug stores have been opened, a 
Business League organized, the Pythian 
Temple finished, five churches erected and 


400 teachers have attended summer normal 
schools. 





Dr, Cyrus Townsend Brady, by a start- 
ling paper read before the Ministers’ Alli- 
ance at a meeting at the Y. M. C. A,, 
awakened the ministers into a realization 
of the Negro problem, and for the first 
time in the history of Kansas City a move- 
ment was organized by the ministers to in- 
vestigate and endeavor to better the condi- 
tion of the blacks. 


The highest average that has been made 
on the punching machine in the Census 
Office was attained by Miss Eva B. Price, 
a colored girl, during the last two weeks 
in October. The work on these machines is 
done on the piece basis, and during this 
period Miss Price earned $88. The high- 
est up to this time that had been paid any 
clerk on this work during any two weeks 
was $85. There are about 500 clerks work- 
ing on the punching machines, and it is 








6 THE CRISIS 


considered very high for a clerk to »unch 
as many as 3,000 cards in one day. Miss 
Price’s highest mark for one day was 
4,200 cards. She accomplished this unusual 
average during the regular seven-hour day, 
and has never worked on extra time. 


In Philadelphia prominent churchmen of 
sevcral denominations participated in a 
conference on the American Negro ques- 
tion, held in the Central Young Men’s 
Christian Association, 1421 Arch Street. 
Bishop Mackay-Smith presided, and the 
speakers included such leaders in denomi- 
national affairs as the Rev. Dr. Frank P. 
Parkin, district superintendent of the Meth- 
odist Episcopal Church; the Rev. Dr. A. J. 
Rowland, secretary of the American Bap- 
tist Publication Society; the Rev. Dr. Ed- 
win Heyl Delk, of St. Matthew’s Lutheran 
Church; the Rev. Edwin F. Randolph, of 
Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church; B. 
F. Lee, Jr., of the Armstrong Association, 
and James S. Stemons. 

With the exception of the Bishop, these 
ministers and laymen are associated in the 
Association for Equalizing Industrial Op- 
portunities, the purpose of which is to 
secure fair play for the Negro wage earner 
in the industrial world. 


In Cincinnati the last of the $2,000 needed 
to start an institution for colored women 
similar to the Y. W. C. A. has been re- 
ceived by Miss Elma C. Leach, of the Eliz- 
abeth Gamble Deaconess Association, and 
the work will be prosecuted at once. The 
home will be opened on West Sixth Street, 
near Mound. Temporary quarters will 
there be provided for colored girls coming 
into the city for work and for girls who 
are found to be living in undesirable en- 
vironments. A nursery will be established 
and theoretical nursing taught. Lectures 
will also be given. 


In a report the State Inspector of Asy- 
lums of Kentucky says that the buildings 
in which the Negro patients at the Eastern 
Kentucky Asylum are confined are a dis- 
grace to the State. One is a cottage 
with basement and one story above. This 
building, he states, is in a very dangerous 
condition, likely to collapse at any time. 
It is simply held up with props put under 
it from time to time, and should a heavy 
wind strike it, it probablv would collapse. 
In this building there are forty-two colored 
female patients. In the other colored ward 
building, which has a basement and two 
stories, the conditions are equally as bad. 
Both male and female patients are confined 
in this building, but are kept separate and 
distinct. The female capacity is thirty-two 
—there are forty-one patients; the male 
capacity is seventy—there are eighty-eight 
patients. So crowded is the building that 
a great number are compelled to sleep in 
the basement, which is very dark and damp 
and in rainy weather water collects therein. 
The inspector states that neither the Board 


of Control nor the officers of this institu- 
tion are to blame, for they are doing 
everything in their power to avert a dis- 
aster, 


COLORED COLLEGES. 


Howard University at Washington, D.C., 
has this year 1,350 students. The college 
students number 347, of whom 167 are 
freshmen. Requirements have been raised 
both for admission to the college and med- 
ical school. The faculties include 110 pro- 
fessors, instructors and officers. The en- 
dowment amounts to $281,000. The med- 
ical school has received $55,000 in cash for 
tuition fees during the last two years. A 
new Carnegie library and hall of applied 
science have recently been added to the 
plant, and also a steam-heating plant. 






Lincoln University, Chester Countv, Pa., 
has 136 students in the college and 50 in 
the theological seminary; all of these are 
taught by twelve professors and three in- 
structors. The grounds and buildings are 
worth $250,000, and the endowment is a 
little over $600,000. Lately an electric 
plant has been added, and a new pipe organ. 


Virginia Union University has 55 stu- 
dents in the college and 30 in the theologi- 
cal department, 120 in the academy and 40 
in the grades. There are sixteen instruct- 
ors. A special attempt is being made to 
get a new dormitory. 


Wilberforce University has issued a 
statement which says: 

“Though our existence was threatened in 
the past by poverty, war and fire, yet we 
have passed from a school with 52 acres of 
land, one building, a few small cottages, a 
primary department of instruction, two 
teachers and a handful of students, to three 
large united schools in operation to-day, 
aside from the military department. These 
are the college, the theological, and the 
normal and industrial schools, instructing 
in the following courses of study: Clas- 
sical, scientific, academic, theological, music, 
English preparatory, military, art, business, 
sewing, carpentry, printing, cooking, shoe- 
making, blacksmithing, wheelwrighting, 
brickmaking and_ bricklaying, plumbing, 
tailoring, and applied mechanics and milli- 
nery. It has 350 acres of the best land in 
Ohio. It has now ten brick buildings, in- 
cluding four large halls, a $60,000 trades 
building, and a library costing $18,000, the 
gift of Mr. Andrew Carnegie. The value 
of the entire plant, with equipment, is quite 
$350,000. There are 32 teachers and an 
average of 400 students, and we could have 
over one thousand if we had accommoda- 
tions for them.” 


Mr. W. A. Joiner, formerly of Howard 
University, is superintendent of the State 
Department at Wilberforce.

Atlanta University has 400 students en- 
rolled. Fifty of these are in the college 
course, with 30 teachers and officers. There 
are 653 normal and college graduates. The 
plant consists of seven brick buildings, in- 
cluding a library worth about $300,000; the 
endowment is $75,000, and a special effort 
is being made to raise $60,000 this year. 

Shaw University, Raleigh, N. C., has 
over 500 students enrolled, and applicants 
have been turned away. There are prepara- 
tory, normal and college departments, and 
classes in theology, medicine and law. 
Attention is also given to music and indus- 
tries. The Leonard medical building has 
been enlarged and a hospital is being built; 
shower baths have been put into the gym- 
nasium and other buildings enlarged. Pres- 
ident Meserve is just completing his seven- 
teenth year of service. 





The Georgia State Industrial College is 
near Savannah, Ga. It has 86 acres and 
468 students. The school curriculum in- 
cludes literary and industrial work. Each 
student has to take a trade along with his 
other studies. The school depends en- 
tirely upon income from the Landscript 
and Morrill funds. Among its outside 
activities are farmers’ conferences and an 
annual State fair. 

EDUCATION. 

In South Carolina Governor-elect Cole 
L. Bleaze is opposed to the division of the 
educational fund of the State of South 
Carolina between schools for the Negroes 
and the white children. It became known 
lately that the future Governor is con- 
vinced that it would be good for the State 
if the educational fund is divided so that 
taxes paid by whites for educational pur- 
poses go for the education of white chil- 
dren, and that those paid by blacks be used 
for the education of Negroes. 

“T am firmly convinced, after the most 
careful thought and study,” said Colonel 
Bleaze to-day, “that the Almighty created 
the Negro to be a hewer of wood and 
drawer of water. I also believe that the 
greatest mistake the white race has ever 
made was in attempting to educate the free 
Negro.” 


The first report of the Lousiana Depart- 
ment of Education for the year ending 
July 1, 1910, shows that the total amount 
spent for the maintenance of the public 
schools by the State was $4,936,300.64. Of 
this amount colored teachers received in 
salaries $202,251.13, while white teachers 
received $2,404,062.54. There are 5,001 
white teachers employed and 1,285 colored 
teachers. White male teachers received an 
average monthly salary of $75.29, and 
white female teachers received an average 
monthly salary of $50.80. The average 
monthly salary of colored male teachers 
was only $34.25, and of colored female 


teachers $28.67. The average length of 
session of colored elementary schools is 
46 months. The average lengths of ses- 
sion of white elementary and high schools 
is 8.23 months. There are 9,771 whites en- 
rolled in the high schools. No figures are 
given for colored students enrolled in high 
schools. There are 54,637 colored children 
attending elementary schools, and 128,022 
white children; 75.9 per cent. of white 
educable children are enrolled, and only 
45.3 per cent. of the colored children. The 
average monthly cost of each child based 
on average attendance, white $2.90, colored 


$1.21. 


The colored people of Plateau have the 
credit of being the leading Negro settle- 
ment in Mobile County, Alabama, in re- 
spect to raising money to help educate 
their children, The patrons of the school 
have raised over $180 for their school this 
year, $144 of this money being raised 
Thanksgiving Day. They are buving a 
beautiful site for a high school at a cost of 
$900. Over $600 of this money has been 
raised, and they are struggling to finish it 
this present school term. 


That a systematic and organized crusade 
on idleness among members oi the colored 
race is to be continued was indicated at 
the meeting of the Texas Negro Law and 
Order League at Houston, Texas. In a 
forceful address calling the attention of 
the members of the league to many vital 
questions affecting the welfare of the race 
President John M. Atkins stated that the 
time was ripe for sending literature over 
the country urging all Negro parents to 
look to the moral training of their bovs. 

For the purpose of urging every colored 
resident of New Orleans to contribute $1 
per annum to be used in educating Negro 
children, a poll tax association among the 
colored people has been formed. A meet 
ing was held Wednesday night and a city- 
wide campaign with this object in view 
was planned. Circulars will be printed. 
stating the reasons for the movement, and 
the leaders of every Negro organization in 
the city will be asked to prevail upon his 
respective membership to see that they pay 
their poll tax. 

Strong addresses were delivered before 
the Mississippi Conference of the Method 
ist Episcopal Church by Professor D. C. 
Potts. president of the Mississippi Indus- 
trial College, and Dr. F. M. Willams of 
the North Mississippi Conference. Pro- 
fessor Potts gave a detailed report of the 
work done at the institution and decl. red 
that the enrollment at this time of the year 
far exceeds that of any previous year. He 
stated that the property was conservatively 
valued at $150,000. and congratulated the 
Negroes of Mississippi upon giving so 
much for the education of their own chil- 
dren. 








8 THE CRISIS 


THE CHURCH. 

There are now five Negro priests in the 
Catholic Church in the United States; 
three are in the Order of St. Joseph, one 
is a member of the Holy Ghost order, and 
the fifth is attached to Archbishop Ireland’s 
diocese in St. Paul, Minn. 


On Sunday afternoon, October 30, the 
societies of the Holy Name of the Roman 
Catholic Church made a big demonstration 
in Washington, D. C. One feature of it 
was the parade, with several thousand in 
line, including delegations from Baltimore 
and other nearby places. There were many 
colored men in line, but there was no sem- 
blance of “jim crowing.” Each marched 
with his own parish members of whatever 
color. There was a full share of colored 
mounted marshals and two: of the six 
bands were colored, but the colored bands 
were not leading colored contingents. 

This was in striking contrast to the ac- 
tion of the local committee of the World’s 
Su. day School Congress here last May, 
which barred the few colored delegates 
from the parade altogether, while in other 
places they were segregated as far as pos- 
sible. 


Two thousand Negro Baptists have been 
meeting in Little Rock, Ark. 


The M. E. Conference at Nacogdoches, 
Texas, opened by singing “And are we yet 
alive!” 


ECONOMIC. 


During the last few days Negroes, gen- 
erally known as “freedmen” from the 
Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, have paid 
over $50,000 to the commissioner to the five 
tribes of Indians at Muskogee for land. 
The “freedmen” were allowed to select 
enough land to bring their allotments up to 
forty acres, paying for it the appraised 
value of the land. This appraisement was 
made by the government several years ago, 
and is about one-fourth of the actual cash 
value of the land now. The Negroes were 
given this p ferential right to buy by a 
special act of Congress and their right ex- 
pired December 1, which caused the rush. 


A colored church in Atlanta has opened 
a labor exchange. 


A number of Omaha colored men have 
incorporated the International Railroad 
Safety. Pipe Coupling Company. It will 
manufacture the Harris coupling for cars. 
This aims at enabling coupling of steam 
air brake and emergency pipes without 
compelling a man to go under the cars and 
risk being crushed. The appliance is made 
to go under the Janney coupler. A. H. 
Harris of Denver is the inventor, and an 
Omaha foundry is making the castings for 
railways to try out. 


Attorney-General Foy of the Province of 
Ontario, Canada, has included the name of 
Delos R. Davis in a new list of king’s 
counsels for that province. Mr. Davis is a 
colored barrister before the Amherstburg 
bar of long standing, and will do honor to 
his new title of “K. C.” 


It required 55,000 enumerators to take 
the census; of these 1,605 were Negroes, 
and 1,295 of these Negroes were in the 
Southern States. Secretary Nagel said, a 
few days ago, that he had not heard a sin- 
gle complaint against them. Ten years ago 
there were no Negroes at all taking census 
in South Carolina, but this vear 131 colored 
were employed. 


ART. 

The playing of Miss Helen Hagan at the 
concert of the Second Company, Gov- 
ernor’s Foot Guard Band, has been the sub- 
ject of much enthusiastic comment during 
the past week. Many of the best musi- 
cians of New Haven were present, and 
their opinions constitute for Miss Hagan 
a “judgment of her peers.” Miss Hagan is 
a “prize student” of the Yale department of 
music and has been heard several times in 
concert work accompanied by the New 
Haven Symphony Orchestra. Her playing 
has always brought down the house. On 
the occasion of the Foot Guard concert she 
appeared twice upon the program in solos 
by Chopin, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, Schu- 
mann and MacDowell, and responded to

William E. Scott has returned to Indian- 
apolis from Paris, where ne went nearly 
two years ago to continue his art work. 
He was born and reared in Indiananolis. 
He began his art studies under Otto Stark, 
while a student at the Manual Training 
High School. After graduating he became 
assistant teacher of art in the high school, 
which position he held a year and a half. 
He entered the Chicago Art Institute in 
1904, won some cash scholarships and be- 
came proficient as a mural artist. During 
his last year’s attendance at the institute he 
did the mural decorations for five of the 
public school buildings of Chicago. For a 
short time after graduating from the insti- 
tute he was engaged in special work in 
illustration, after which he went to Paris 
and studied under P. Marcel Beareneau 
and later under H. O. Tanner. He exhib- 
ited three paintings last August in a Paris 
salon, and traveled over England, Hol- 
land and Belgium before returning here.

OPINION 


THE APPEAL TO EUROPE. 


On October 26 a statement and appeal 
was sent to Europe signed by thirty-two 
Negro Americans. The appeal was not 
sent out by the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People, nor 
did the association stand sponsor for it. 
It was sent solely on the authority of the 
men who signed it. These men include two 
editors, one dentist, seven lawyers, two 
ministers, two bishops, three physicians, one 
teacher, two presidents of educational insti- 
tutions, one member of a Legislature and 
others. 

This appeal, after stating that its signers 
do not agree with Mr. Washington’s picture 
of conditions here, states the following 
grievances : 

“Our people were emancipated in a whirl 
of passion, and then left naked to the mer- 
cies of their enraged and impoverished ex- 
masters. As our sole means of defense we 
were given the ballot, and we used it so as 
to secure the real fruits of the war. With- 
out it we would have returned to slavery; 
with it we struggled toward freedom. No 
sooner, however, had we rid ourselves of 
nearly two-thirds of our illiteracy and ac- 
cumulated $600,000,000 worth of property 
in a generation, than this ballot, which had 
become increasingly necessary to the de- 
fense of our civil and property rights, was 
taken from us by force and fraud. 

“Yo-day in eight States where the bulk 
of the Negroes live, black men of property 
and university training can be, and usually 
are, by law denied the ballot, while the 
most ignorant white man votes. This at- 
tempt to put the personal and property 
rights of the best of the blacks at the abso- 
lute political mercy of the worst of the 
whites is spreading each day. 

“Along with this has gone a systematic 
attempt to curtail the education of the black 
race. Under a widely advertised system of 
‘universal’ education, not one black boy in 
three to-day has in the United States a 
chance to learn to read and write. The 
proportion of school funds due to black 
children are often spent on whites, and 
the burden on private charity to support 
education, which is a public duty, has be- 
come almost intolerable. 

“In every walk of life we meet discrim- 
ination, based solely on race and color, but 
continually and persistently misrepresented 
to the world as the natural difference due 
to condition. 

“We are, for instance, usually forced to 
iive in the worst quarters, and our conse- 
quent death rate is noted as a race trait, 
and reason for further discrimination. 


When we seek to buy property in better 
quarters we are sometimes in danger of 
mob violence or, as now in Baltimore, of 
actual legislation to prevent. 

“We are forced to take lower wages for 
equal work, and our standard of living is 
then criticised. Fully half the labor unions 
refuse us admittance, and then claim that 
as ‘scabs’ we lower the price of labor. 

“A persistent caste proscription seeks to 
force us and confine us to menial occupa- 
tions where the conditions of work are 
worst. 

“Our women in the South are without 
protection in law and custom, and are then 
derided as lewd. A widespread system of 
deliberate public insult is customary, which 
makes it difficult, if not impossible, to se- 
cure decent accommodation in hotels, rail- 
way trains, restaurants and theatres, and 
even in the Christian church we are in 
most cases given to understand that we are 
unwelcome unless segregated. 

“Worse than all this is the wilful mis- 
carriage of justice in the courts. Not only 
have 2,500 black men been lynched publicly 
by mobs in the last twenty-five years, with- 
out semblance or pretense of trial, but regu- 
larly every day throughout the South the 
machinery of the courts is used, not to pre- 
vent crime and correct the wayward among 
the Negroes, but to wreak public dislike and 
vengeance and to raise public funds. This 
dealing in crime as a means of public reve- 
nue is a system well-nigh -universal in the 
South, and while its glaring brutality 
through private lease has been checked, the 
underlying principle is still unchanged. 

“Everywhere in the United States the old 
democratic doctrine of recognizing fitness 
wherever it occurs is losing ground before 
a reactionary policy of denying preferment 
in political or industrial life to competent 
men if they have a trace of Negro blood, 
and of using the weapons of public insult 
and humiliation to keep such men down. 
It is to-day a universal demand in the 
South that on all occasions social courtesies 
shall be denied any person of known Negro 
descent, even to the extent of refusing to 
apply the titles of ‘Mr.,’ ‘Mrs.’ or ‘Miss.’ 

“Against this dominant tendency, strong 
and brave Americans, white and black, are 
fighting, but they need, and need sadly, the 
moral support of England and of Europe 
in this crusade for the recognition of man- 
hood, despite adventitious differences of 
race, and it is like a blow in the face to 
have one who himself suffers daily insult 
and humiliation in America give the im- 
pression that all is well. It is one thing to 
be optimistic, self-forgetful and forgiving, 








10 THE CRISIS 


but it is quite a different thing, consciously 
Or unconsciously, to misrepresent the 
truth.” 

This appeal has provoked widespread 
comment all over,the world. The Vienna 
(Austria) Die Zeit, in publishing the docu 
ment, says 

“During the sojourn in Vienna of Booker 
T. Washington, the distinguished apostle 
of the Negro, there appeared in Die Zeit a 
report from his pen in which he defended 
the white race of North America against 
the charge of systematic race prejudice and 
pictured the condition of the Negro race as 
on the whole very favorable. This report 
created great excitement in America and a 
deep disagreement among the intelligent 
leaders of the American Negroes. Booker 
T. Washington was warmly attacked in 
many American papers by both white and 
black speakers, and finally the American 
Negro leaders drew up an outspoken pro- 
test against Washington’s declarations.” 

The K6lnische Volk Zeitung, Germany, 
speaks of an article which was “widely 
printed in Austria and Germany,” in which 
Mr. Washington “expressed himself in very 
optimistic words concerning his race in 
America and the undoubted solution of the 
problem,” and then reprints a part of the 
appeal. 

In the United States the comment has 
taken wide range. From the South comes 
some bitterness when, for instance, the 
Raleigh News and Courier says: 

“It is hard to tell which is the worst 
enemy of the Negro race—the brute who 
invites lynching by the basest of crimes, or 
the social-equality-hunting fellow like Du 
Bois, who slanders his country. Fortu- 
nately for the peaceable and industrious 
Negroes in the South, the world does not 
judge them either by Du Bois or the ani- 
mal, and helps them and is in sympathy 
with their efforts to better their condition.” 

The Richmond Leader adds: 

“Efforts on the part of the Negro to give 
practical expression to the dream of equal- 
ity may, indeed, cause temporary trouble 
and discomfort to the whites, but ultimately 
and necessarily they could not fail to pro- 
voke stern repression, and, if necessary, 
cruel punishment to the blacks. Fortu- 
nately, the great bulk of the Negro popula- 
tion in the South realizes this, and, having— 
at least for the time—accepted it as inev- 
itable, they adjust themselves to the subor- 
dinate place to which their race consigns 
them, and in which the very existence of the 
superior race makes it absolutely necessary 
to’ keep them. There is little friction, 
therefore, between them and the white peo- 
ple among whom they live.” 

The Chattanooga Times regards the doc- 
ument as “treasonable incendiarism,” and 
many papers denounce it as a demand for 
“social equality.” The New Orleans Times- 
Democrat says: 

“To the average American the most strik- 
ing feature is this ‘appeal,’ aside from its 
attack upon Booker Washington, is its con- 


fession, virtually in so many words, that 
the theory of racial social equality is losing 
ground ‘everywhere in the United States.’ 
Thoughtful students of the American race 
problem long ago noted the steady spread 
of race instinct, or prejudice, into sections 
other than the South; but it was hardly to 
be expected that the blatant Negro agita- 
tors would confess that their strident de- 
mands for race equality have not only com- 
pletely failed, but have helped to turn the 
scale against them. Such progress as the 
Negro has made is recorded not by aid of 
these aspirants for social equality, but in 
spite of them.” 

The Jersey City Journal says Negroes 
can vote in the North, they are educated in 
the North, they are only partially restricted 
in residence, they usually get equal pay for 
equal work, and the “objection to having 
colored people in residence sections is nat- 
ural.” 

The Chicago Tribune “can understand 
and sympathize” with the signers of the 
protest, but points out that the positions 
occupied by the signers themselves show 
the progress of the Negro. 

The New York World says: 

“Undeniably, the bl: ack population of the 
United States has just grievances. So also 
has the white population in the United 
States. Race prejudice is here as it is in 
Europe, and blacks are not the only suffer- 
ers. There is brutal tyranny in industrv, 
but the blacks are not the only victims. 
There are social limitations that are cruel 
and inexcusable, but the blacks are not the 
only ones against whom the gates are shut. 

“This is a world in which true men give 
and take. It is a world in which all must 
make allowances. It is a world in which, 
after all, men are judged not so much by 
race or nationality or possessions as by per- 
sonal merit. Otherwise, how could a 
300ker Washington, born a Virginia slave, 
have ‘stood before kings’ and associated for 
the greater part of his life with the earth’s 
greatest and best? 

“We do not condemn the American men 
of color who have made this protest. We 
simply remonstrate with them. They are 
asking more than a white man’s chance, and 
in the circumstances that is inadmissible.” 

The Boston Globe, however, thinks that 
“these and other complaints are backed by 
educated Negroes, who demand that the 
old world shall know their wrongs. They 
deny that Dr. Washington is giving the 
right impression of the situation in this 
country. It would seem to the average per- 
son that admittedly there is much truth in 
the catalog of wrongs the association re- 
cites.” 

The Brooklyn Times, too, acknowledges 
that “the lot of the colored American is a 
hard one at best, but there is nothing to be 
gained by complaining over conditions and 
prejudices that cannot be altered or eradi- 
cated in the lifetime of a single generation. 
There are obstacles in the path of the 
Afro-American, even the most intelligent

and aspir o. which the meanest white 
man can ha. form an adequate concep- 
tion; the only thing the Negro can do is to 
make the best of hard conditions and do 
his utmost by his individual achievements 
to make the handicap of his color for- 
gotten. 

“It is not surprising, however, that to 
many ambitious colored citizens patience 
sometimes ceases to seem a virtue.” 

It adds that the appeal “is a mild state- 
ment of existing conditions. The lot of 
the colored American is indeed a hard one. 
But it is improving. The area of sweet 
reasonableness is being gradually extended. 
Old prejudices, and especially racial preju- 
dices, die hard, as the history of the dis- 
persed Hebrew nation tells on every page 
of the annals of 2,000 years. But prejudice 
is not eternal, and every colored American 
who does the utmost of his duty in the 
place he fills does his part in bringing 
about the day when ungenerous and unjust 
discrimination will disappear, and when 

Man to man, the world o’er, 
Shall brothers be, for a’ that.” 

Finally, the Buffalo Express says em- 
phatically : 

“The memorial recites the long and fam'l- 
iar list of Negro wrongs—the political dis- 
franchisement, the denial of education in 
some States, the discriminations in public 
places, the forcing into menial occupations, 
the hostility of trades unions, the attempts 
to confine Negroes to certain quarters of 
towns, the insults to Negro women, etc. 
It need not be gone over here. Readers of 
the Express are familiar with the shameful 
record. The fact that this is an appeal to 
the people of Europe against the people of 
the United States will arouse fresh antag- 
onism to the Negro in some quarters, but, 
on the whole, it will do good. For shame’s 
sake, if not for that of justice, it may 
arouse us to do our duty. The opinion of 
the civilized world must have some effect 
on the most calloused American official con- 
science. And it is our governing class, our 
men and women of light and leading. that 
need to be aroused on this question.” 

; THE GHETTO. 

The Baltimore attempt to segregate col- 
ored people has called forth widespread 
comment. <A letter in the New York Sun 
thus portrays conditions: 

“The Negro invasion in Baltimore is 
principally in a north and northwesterly 
direction, comprising the most beautiful, 
most exclusive and most valuable residen 
tial sections. About the year 1885 steadily 
but insidiously the Negro began to invade 
white residential sections. In Pennsylva- 
ma Avenue, beginning at Franklin Street 
in the downtown district and running north 
about twenty-six blocks to the intersection 
of North Avenue and Druid Hill Avenue, 
beginning at Paca Street in the downtown 
district and running north about twenty 
blocks to the intersection of North Avenue, 
as well as all blocks lying between Penn- 








sylvania and Druid Hill Avenues and con- 
taining substantially built three-story 
houses, are now in the exclusive possession 
of the Negroes. They ezre now beginning 
to invade McCulloh Street, Madison Ave- 
nue, Eutaw Place and Linden Avenue, 
which run parallel with Pennsylvania and 
Druid Hill Avenues.” 

Some papers see in this indubitable evi- 
dence of the rise of colored people. 

As the Fitchburg (Mass.) Sentinel 
puts it: 

“This is one of the most hopeful situa- 
tions regarding the Negro which has been 
painted. It is enough to send shivers down 
the backs of the people who believe that 
‘Cursed by Canaan’ is to hold good for all 
time. But it is an immense reassurance to 
those who are looking for the uplift of the 
black race. it seems, from this picture, 
that they must be getting rich rapidly. 
Thev are obtaining possession of fine resi- 
dential property. They want to live in fine 
houses, the same as white folks with 
money. Doubtless, too, the same as white 
folks, they want to have the good things 
which money will buy. 

“Judged by any test other than color, 
they seem to be very desirable citizens.” 

Other papers, like the Bridgeport Tele- 
gram, scent danger: 

“If they are deprived of the right to 
build homes where they please which is 
accorded to the most degraded white man 
who lands upon these shores provided peo- 
ple will sell land to him, and robbed of the 
right to become skilled workmen, their situ- 
ation will be a much graver one than that 
from which the Civil War delivered them.” 

Dr. Henry Moskowitz, in the New York 
Evening Post, points to the Russian analogy 
and the Boston Globe also insists on the 
failure of the Ghetto idea: 

“Segregation has never been a very suc- 
cessful solution of the race problem, as 
may be seen in the experience of Euro- 
pean cities with ghettos and in Russia’s 
attempt to keep Jews confined within cer- 
tain pales. The Baltimore city council, 
however, by a piece of special pleading in 
its report, tries to justify the ordinance by 
saying that its ‘underlying purpose is the 
maintenance of peace and good order and 
the avoidance of friction and irritation be- 
tween the two races.’ The ordinance ‘aims 
to prevent the whites from becoming a dis- 
turbing element to the blacks and likewise 
to prevent the Negroes from becoming a 
disturbing element to the whites.’ Ahem!” 

The New York Journal calls the experi- 
ment dangerous: 

“It is true that the establishment of 
homes of colored people in neighborhoods 
hitherto unfrequented by them causes an- 
tagonism and may produce trouble and dis- 
turb real estate values. But it is also true 
that it is dangerous, unjust and unworthy 
of this century to revive the obsolete 
ghetto system. denying to certain human 
beings the right to live where they please 
and where they can. 








12 THE CRISIS 


“We suppose that a white man who owns 
a house has a legal right to sell it to a 
Negro if he pleases. And we suppose that 
the highest court in the country will sustain 
the right of a colored man to live in his 
own home, subject to the tax laws and reg- 
ulations of his neighborhood. 

“Probably the plan to compel a hundred 
thousand colored people in Baltimore to 
live all together in one neighborhood could 
not legally be enforced.” 

On the legal side of the matter Charles 
J. Bonaparte, formerly United States Attor- 
ney-General, says to a Baltimore Sun 
reporter: 

“IT have always understood, however, that 
it was a lawful use of private property to 
sell or rent one’s house for a proper pur 
pose to an orderly person of whatever race 
or color, without regard to the wishes or 
the complexion of those who live next door, 
and, if this be true, then the well-known 
Radecke case, in Forty-ninth Maryland, to 
say nothing of other authorities, would 
seem to show clearly that if our always 
wise Mayor and City Council should under- 
take to interfere in such a matter, they 
could, and would, be politely advised to 
mind their own business.” 

The Brooklyn Eagle, the Nyack (N. Y.) 
Star and the Dover (N. H.) Democrat call 
attention to the Lee Sing case (43 rederal 
Reports, 359), which voided an ordinance 
restricting the residence of a Chinaman. 

The New York Sun says on the “prop- 
erty values” issue: 

“The Baltimore ordinance cannot be sup- 
ported on the ground that it is intended to 
protect one race against the indignities in- 

variably experienced whenever it is com- 
pelled to force its presence upon another 
race in the pursuit of education, business 
and pleasure or in the exercise of political 
rights. Its frank purpose is to protect the 
property interests of the stronger race. In 
the opinion of the City Council of Balti- 
more real estate values in certain avenues 
have depreciated 30 to 50 per cent. owing 
to the presence of Negro residents, but if 
the sapient council were to study the re- 
cent census showing of Baltimore it would 
no doubt find that other causes have been 
at work in bringing about the depreciation. 
In any event, the proposed ordinance in- 
volves a principle which the courts are not 
likely to accept.” 

The Manchester (N. H.) Union says: 

“It would seem as if the Negroes them- 
selves would tire of making purchases 
which immediately sink in value from a 
third to one-half, and it is somewhat pecul- 
iar that in Philadelphia and Washington 
there has been no tendency to anything of 
the kind, either as to encroachment upon 
the territory of the whites or a deprecia- 
tion of the property occupied by the 
Negroes.” 

The Macon (Ga.) Telegraph sees a 
chance for the Negro to make money 
through such segregation and to be proud 
of their Ghettos, but the Southwestern 


Christian Advocate, a colored paper, says: 

“It is almost certain that wherever there 
is a Negro quarter there will be little or no 
city improvement. Notwithstanding Ne- 
groes pay the same rate of taxes, the 
streets on which they live are seldom 
paved, poorly lighted, and any public im- 
provements that might be made are always 
last in coming to them. Thousands of 
Negroes make an effort not to buy within 
the white district but so near that district 
that they may be able to get some of the 
city improvements. There is also a meas- 
ure of protection as well as a measure of 
convenience when Negroes live on the bet- 
ter streets. 

“The Negro has a just protest against 
the sort of treatment he is forced to en 
dure notwithstanding he is a taxpayer. It 
may be alleged that he is not a heavy tax- 
payer, and this we grant, but there are 
sections of cities sparsely settled which are 
improved at the behest of speculators while 
Negro residents are compelled to live in 
discomfiture and inconvenience because of 
the lack of improvement.” 

Dr. Hughes of Baltimore, speaking for 
colored citizens, said: 

“It means the stopping of self-respecting, 
law-abiding colored citizens in their efforts 
to secure homes and plant themselves in 
communities as taxpayers. 

“Rental values will advance since there 
will be no outlet for an already congested 
population; they must stay where they are, 
and in order to do so pay any price which 
an unscrupulous money grabber may de- 
mand. With the high cost of foodstuffs 
and the low scale of wages for unskilled 
labor the passage of the West ordinance 
points to the creation of a pauper element 
in our city rather than a thrifty, law-abid 
ing colored citizenship, and the pauper ele- 
ment of any city or community makes the 
more prosperous pay in one way or another 
for their support. 

“In your ordinance you involve the bread 
of my people. Recently I stood in Pierce 
Street and overheard this conversation: 
A colored woman was asked, ‘Did you get 
the place?’ ‘Yes, I got it and started to 
work, when the lady asked me where I 
lived, and when I told her she said she 
could not have any one in her house who 
came from that street. She said there was 
too much disease there.’ It remained for 
that woman to move. With the West 
ordinance in force, where could she go? 
We have already a crowded colored popu- 
lation. For her to move out meant for 
some one else to move in. It affects not 
only the employed, but the employer, and 
the only way out is for the man who hires 
a servant to go to the additional expense 
of renting or buying a house for his ser- 
vants in more healthy quarters, which will 
aggravate the already troublesome help 
problem.” 

The Philadelphia Ledger adds helplessly:

the inscrutable problems of our time and 
generation. His own unaided efforts are 
blocked everywhere by caste restrictions 
and discriminations.” 

The New York Globe says: 

“The Negro has been told to smile and 
look pleasant as his political rights have 
been taken from him. The argument has 
been that 1f he did not make a fuss over 
voting the race prejudice of his white fel- 
low citizen would abate—that he would be 
given a freer chance to work, to acquire 
property, to become of material weight in 
the community. But, North as well as 
South, doors of industry are being shut 
against the Negro. The economic tragedy 
of the educated Negro who aspires to good 
things is pitiful. He finds either that per- 
sonal effort and merit do not count, or that 
they do not count much. In many places 
it is against the Negro who is not willing 
to stay down in the mire that antipathy 
blazes the most brightly. He is the ‘big- 
gotty nigger.” 

Finally the Boston Heiaid pauses to re- 
mark: 

“We purchased more than we knew with 
that first cargo of slaves sold by the Dutch 
captain to the Virginia planters now almost 
three hundred years ago.” 


GOMPERS. 

It seems pretty certain that Samuel Gom- 
pers, president of the American Federation 
of Labor, was to some extent misquoted 
on the Negro problem. The official version 
given by Mr. Charles Stetzle is as follows: 

“The race problem came up in the con- 
vention, but not altogether by the choice of 
the delegates. President Gompers had 
given an address on the depressed races, 
remarking that it could not be expected 
that the Negro, for instance, could have as 
high an ideal for himself as the Caucasian. 
A morning newspaper came out next morn- 
ing and in big headlines said that Gompers 
had ‘read the Negro out of the trades 
union,’ when, as a matter of fact, Gompers 
meant exactly the opposite. He took occa- 
sion to correct the erroneous impression 
which had been made upon the public. At 
any rate, he spoke of it at least three dif- 
ferent times in public addresses.” 

The incident has caused much comment, 
most of it based on the supposition that 
union labor is officially drawing the color 
line. The Chicago Post says: 

“The American Federation of Labor has 
always declared that ‘the working people 
must unite and organize, irrespective of 
creed, color, sex, nationality or politics.’ 
For many years the Federation denied 
membership to all unions which drew the 
color line—a stand which kept out, for ex- 
ample, the International Association of 
Machinists until it eliminated the word 
‘white’ from its constitution. Even when 
the A. F. of L. relented sufficiently to admit 
several of the railroad brotherhoods which 
were closed to Negroes, Mr. Gompers was 


always very robust in his assertion that 
organized labor welcomed the Negro 
worker. When the Industrial Commission 
of 1900 quizzed Mr. Gompers on the race 
issue, it drew from him some very touch- 
ing stories of Negro loyalty to the trade 
union movement. He talked pretty much 
iike an abolitionist up to a few years 
ago. 

The Chicago Daily News says: 

“Mr. Gompers was represented in the orig- 
inal report of his address to have dealt 
with Negroes and Asiatics as if the prob- 
lems presented by the two were similar. 
Everybody should know that they are not. 

“The Negroes are native-born Ameri- 
can citizens. They know no other land 
It is their sincere desire, according to the 
measure of their abilities, to share in the 
life of the American people. They are 
making progress in education and industry. 
Under these conditions, to deny to Negroes 
the right to join labor unions when they 
meet the standards required of white ap- 
plicants for membership would be clearly 
un-American.” 

The comments of two other papers are 
characteristic. The Charleston (S. C.) 
News and Courier is complacent: 

“There is no use to palaver about and 
invent reasons. Everybody who knows 
anything at all knows that racial antipathy 
is a real thing, even though intangible. 
Why beat about the bush and deny it? 
Aside from the ignorance of the Negro, his 
many weaknesses, his fatal physiological 
structure, his extraction prevents his recog- 
nition as a social equal, be he in South 
Africa, America or anywhere else. On that 
ground his elimination from white unions 
is a necessity. Concomitant reasons need 
not be given. They follow in natural se- 
quence.” 

The New York Evening Post says, how- 
ever < 

‘But even should a reactionary policy of 
rigid exclusion prevail, it cannot keep the 
Negro down industrially; it will doubtless 
handicap him in many sections, but the only 
people who can keep the Negroes in an 
inferior economic and social position are 
the Negroes themselves. A race that has 
risen so rapidly against such wonderful 
odds is to be held back by no organization 
of workingmen, however powerful.” 





“COLORED.” 

The case of the child with one-sixteenth 
Negro blood whom the District of Colum- 
bia courts call a “Negro” has brought some 
comment. The Detroit News says: 

“Eventually the courts must draw the 
line. The dark races when intimately asso- 
ciated with the white in overpowering num- 
bers gradually bleach out. At the fourth 
remove the descendants are often blond in 
type. As the court seems to take no ac- 
count of the actual color of the individual 
in applying the classification ‘colored,’ it 
must be assumed that definition must de- 
pend upon simple mathematics.” 








14 THE CRISIS 


The Taunton Gazette adds: 

“By the same reasoning a man with one- 
sixteenth Chinese blood is a Chinaman and 
one-sixteenth of the blood of any race 
relegates him to that race. As a matter of 
fact, that question of one-sixteenth is not 
likely to arise in any case save where it is 
desired to make out a person a Negro, and 
that is where the nub of the whole matter 
rests. 

“It is probable that there are thousands 
of persons in this country with one-six- 
teenth Negro blood in them who do not 
know it themselves nor does any one else, 
for family records are not always carefully 
kept along these lines.” 





VOTING. 


The Boston Transcript has this letter 
from Dr. Horace Bumstead: 
“Dr. Doremus Scudder of Hawaii told 


the American Missionary Association in 
Tremont Temple that the American Negro 
of the future will thank his Southern white 
brother for depriving him of the ballot until 
he should have proved his fitness for it— 
and that he would thank him notwithstand- 
ing the manner in which his ballot had 
been taken away. Let us see just what this 
means. 

“It means that the Negro will hereafter 
be grateful for a disfranchisement prac- 
tically based on color rather than unfitness 
—which its promoters have boldly avowed 
was intended to disfranchise every Negro 
if possible and not one white man if it 
could be avoided, and which they accom- 
plished through ‘grandfather’ and ‘under- 
standing’ clauses artfully devised to de 
prive the Negro of his constitutional guar- 
antees for a square deal as regards suf 
frage qualifications 

“It means that the Negro will hereafter 
be grateful for a disfranchisement which 
is seriously restricting his economic free- 
dom and opportunity, the protection of his 
life and property, his right to travel in 
equal comfort for an equal fare, the edu- 
cation of his children, and the guarding of 
the virtue of his wife and daughters. 

“This conclusion Dr. Scudder naively 
states he has arrived at after seven years’ 
residence, not in the South, but in Hawaii, 
and because the liquor dealers there have 
bought up the votes of the natives. In 
other words, when white men have so little 
control over their baser element that they 
cannot keep them from offering bribes, the 
proper course, in Dr. Scudder’s opinion, 
Seems to be to take the ballot from all col- 
ored men because some of them have ac- 
cepted bribes, rather than to disfranchise 
the few white men who have offered them. 

“When American Negroes become grate- 
ful for a disfranchisement accomplished in 
such ways, and on such grounds, and with 
such detriment to their own welfare, they 
will have proved themselves unworthy of 
American citizenship. And that time will 
never come. They are willing to play the 
political game with their white brothers on 


1 





equal terms, but not with loaded dice and 
marked cards.” 

NEGRO SOLDIERS. 

The Boston Herald reports General 
3urt’s views on Negro soldiers as follows: 

“That in the five qualifications that go to 
make up a good soldier, drilling, marks- 
manship, marching, discipline and fighting, 
the Negro soldiers of the United States 
army are paramount, was the contention of 
Brigadier-General Andrew S. Burt, retired, 
ex-commander of the Brownsville Black 
Battalion, in his address last night on ‘The 
Negro Soldier in Ancient and Modern 
Warfare,’ at a meeting of colored people 
in St. Paul’s Baptist Church, under the 
auspices of the Boston Literary Associa- 
tion. 

“He cited two instances in the Spanish- 
American War when the colored troops 
showed their true value as soldiers. The 
first instance being the rescue of the Rough 
Riders by the Tenth Colored Cavalry, the 
second the heroism of the Twenty-fourth 
Colored Infantry in volunteering as nurses 
during the yellow fever epidemic. 

“In speaking of army discipline he re- 
ferred the audience td his sworn testimony 
before the Senate committee on the 
Brownsville ‘shoot-up,’ and challenged the 
comparison of any records of any class of 
good citizens to equal that of the Twenty- 
fifth colored regiment. 

“Speaking of the Negro soldier generally, 
ne said: ‘I can find nowhere in the his- 
tories of the Revolutionary, the Indian, the 
Spanish-American or the war in the Phil- 
ippines, a single instance where a Negro 
regiment showed the white feather or re- 
fused to charge the enemy when called to 
do so.” 


IN SOUTH AFRICA. 

The A. P. O., of Cape Town, South 
Africa, a colored periodical, brings word 
of the appointment of Mr. Hull, a colored 
man, to the South African cabinet. It 
will be remembered that the South African 
Constitution requires cabinet members to 
be “persons of European descent.” Ap- 
parently men of mixed descent are not ex- 
cluded. A. P. O. says: 

“The decision of General Botha not to re- 
linquish the premiership, and of Mr. Hull to 
accept a seat, and so retain the post of 
Treasurer-General, keep the Botha Minis- 
try practically intact. We predicted that 
the Prime Minister would get over his 
defeat and cling to his office with its 
£4,000 a year. 

“Tt is now safe to say that we are already 
on the road toward a Native Parliament, 
which, according to Dr. Broon, is only one 
hundred years off; for not only have many 
of the present M.L.A.’s an infusion of 
native blood in their veins, as is evidenced 
by their features, but the very Cabinet con- 
tains colored men. After all, we are mov- 
ing pretty fast toward the realization of a 
native Government.”

OPINION 15 


The prophecy of Professor Broon, to 
which A. P. O. refers, is thus described 
in the Tsalo Ea Becoana: 

“Prof. R. Broon, lecturing recently in 
Johannesburg on ‘South Africa 100 Years 
Hence,’ made some curious and interesting 
statements. He said he had gone into the 
question and was thoroughly convinced that 
the black man, if the present policy was 
continued, was going to rule South Africa 
in 100 years. He did not include the 
colored people in his meaning, but he re- 


ferred to the Kafir or Bantu race. There 
were some 1,200,000 white people in South 
Africa, while there were 7,200,000 Kafirs. 
One of the principal factors that was 
welding the natives together was religion. 
More and more black labor was being em- 
ployed in the Cape Colony, and in a short 
time the native would have a large num- 
ber of trades in his hands. Intermarriage 
between natives and whites was taking 
place in Cape Colony. The segregation 
policy seemed to be the most practical way 
of saving South Africa for the whites.” 


WO! OW 
A WINTER PILGRIMAGE 


The race problem is not one problem. 
It differs not only in time, but in place. 
Therefore | always go to different groups 
of colored people in this land with much 
of interest and curiosity, knowing that each 
will present its peculiar phase of relation- 
ship between the white and colored group. 

| have just come back from such a jour- 
ney, and its scenes and lessons are filling 
my thought. 

There was Toledo, with its colored group 
a little pushed aside and half forgotten in 
the onward rush of the growing city till 
the group gripped itself and awoke and 
said: “We are a part of Toledo—you may 
not forget us.” So now slowly comes the 
push forward and upward. 

In Cleveland it is far ditferent—it is not 
so much a matter of gaining civic recogni- 
tion as men and women—that battle was 
fought by worthy men long years ago. It 
is the deeper problem of holding the 
ground gained; of not letting theatres and 
restaurants and hotels inaugurate a new 
discrimination which had once disappeared. 
This is a difficult battle of the new eco- 
nomic rise of the Negro; when _ few 
Negroes applied or had money to apply it 
was easy to say theoretically, “Live where 
you will, go where you please.” But when 
a group of black folk growing in power 
put a $75,000 church on your corner—that 
is a phase of the race problem that hadn't 
struck you before. 

Between these cities of past and present 
lies the mystic city of the future, with its 
great cloud walls. 

In Oberlin there are nearly two thousand 
young folk at study and at play. Work- 
ing and playing ‘beside them are a hundred 
colored boys and girls, and they all walk 
on sacred ground, on ground long since 
consecrated to racial equality and hatred of 
caste and slavery. Yet among these vener- 
able ideals obtrudes the Present and it, 
with all its odd corners, must be builded 
into the future city. 

The present holds not only the problem 
of the treatment of ten million black folk 
elsewhere, but of the hundred colorcd boys 
and girls right there in Oberlin. It pre- 


sents a tremendous moral dilemma to frank 
young souls. When these children came 
from anti-slavery homes they found it easy 
and natural to treat black men as men. 
But coming now from a world that thinks 
God made a big mistake in ever creating 
black folk—coming from such _ social 
teaching, they hesitate. Once in a while a 
black student (or rather a yellow one) 
may be elected a society, but usually no 
desert in character or scholarship avails. 

Yet this fact brings no mental teace or 
moral satisfaction. The spirit of democ- 
racy is strong, the influence of the faculty 
is righteous, and I came from five hours’ 
earnest conference with these young folk 
with a sense of seeing a mighty battle for 
righteousness, and a belief that somehow, 
sometime, justice would prevail. 

But after all it was the men I met that 
meant most. Could I introduce them? Let 
me see. There was the young lawyer who 
burned to awaken a sleeping city to its 
duties and rights; there was the brown 
physician who is one of the leading sur 
geons in the city, and his knife finds no 
color line. Then the girl who ran a polit- 
ical campaign last month had a father who 
was director in a white bank and one of 
the solid business men of the town. In 
their parlor gathered a brown father, a 
vellow mother, the white pastor and the 
white girl chum—but why should we cata- 
log the colors of their skins and not those 
of their clothes? In Oberlin the chief book 
store is “colored,” and the chief paper 
hanger and the chief building contractor. 
Elsewhere I sat with the man who had 
just been elected a member of a leading 
white city club and heard how the second 
highest mechanic in the Peerless motor 
factory wore “the shadowed livery of the 
sun.” 

Therefore, all is well? Therefore, all is 
not well. Here are a climbing people. The 
hardiest and most talented and the push- 
ing are literally forcing a way. But 
against them and against the ordinary black 
man the bonds of medievalism are drawn 
and ghettos and sumptuary laws are encom- 


passed in the color line. W. E. B. D.

ENVY. 

T is unfortunate that in the recent 

I newspaper discussion of an Appeal 

to Europe sent out not by this As- 
sociation but by a number of colored 
men of influence and standing, refer- 
ence was constantly made to the low- 
est personal motives and seldom to 
the arguments presented 

It is true that with all peoples, and 
especially with a race in the throes of 
birth-pain, personal likes and jealous- 
ies play a wretchedly large,part. But 
it does not follow that the¥ explain all 
the struggle and difference-of opinion. 
It is true that the rise of “a man like 
Mr. Booker T. Washington to a place 
of commanding influence has made 
him an object of envy to many narrow 
souls. But it does not follow that the 
thousands of intelligent people who 
differ with Mr. Washington are all 
actuated by such motives, or are un- 
able to distinguish great and vital prin- 
ciples apart from personal feeling. 

When, therefore, such differences of 
opinion arise, as it is natural and 
healthy that they should arise, it is 
both wrong and unjust to assume the 
motive to be necessarily low. Particu- 
larly is this true when adequate causes 
of deep and compelling importance are 
openly and honestly given as the cause 
of this difference. 

Are such causes sufficient to sustain 
the complainers? That is a matter of 
argument, not of innuendo or abuse. 
No man and no cause are above the 
careful scrutiny and criticism of hon- 
est men, and certainly to-day there is 
in the United States a very large field 
for argument as to the proper attitude 
of colored leaders toward the race 
problem. 


THE TRUTH. 
O the honest seeker for light the 
I puzzling thing about the South- 
ern situation is the absolutely 
contradictory statements that are often 


made concerning conditions. For in- 
stance, the New York Evening Post is 
taken to task by the Norfolk (Va.) 
Landmark for assuming that South- 
ern colored men are largely disfran- 
chised. The Virginia paper says “No 
Negro in Virginia can be kept from 
voting, provided he measures up to 
the same requirements for the exer- 
cising of that right that the white man 
must. The laws of the State will pro- 
tect him in the right should election 
officials deny it him. That Negroes 
in this State may freely qualify to 
vote is fully attested by the fact that 
thousands of them do vote.” Again, 
the New Orleans Picayune declares 
with regard to the complaint of dis- 
franchisement, “The arrant and abso- 
lute falsity of the specification in re- 
gard to the ballot is seen in the fact 
that every legal bar to the exercise of 
the ballot applies to whites and Ne- 
groes alike. Every elector (voter) 
must either be able to read and write 
or, incase of illiteracy, he must pay 
taxes on ordinary assessable property 
of the minimum value of $300. 
These laws are strictly in accordance 
with the requirements of the Consti- 
tution of the United States, and have 
been so pronounced by the courts.” 

Just so in earlier days before legal 
disfranchisement, paper after paper 
and orator after orator declared that 
the Negro could and did vote without 
let or hindrance. 

Despite this, every intelligent per- 
son in the United States knows that 
these statements are false. The 
Southern testimony to this is itself 
open and convincing. Not only have 
we Mr. Tillman’s frank and pictur- 
esque testimony on the past, but to- 
day the Richmond (Va.) Leader says 
that all is well in Virginia “since we 
disfranchised the Negro”; Congress- 
man Underwood of Alabama says the 
Alabama Negro ‘does not count for 
anything politically” in that State; a

prominent judge on the Mississippi 
bench says “The Negroes in Missis- 
sippi do not vote and should not,” and 
it is a matter of plain official record 
in Louisiana that of over 150,000 Ne- 
gro males 21 years of age and over 
(of whom nearly 70,000 could read 
and write) there were in 1908 only 
1,743 registered as voters, and these 
were disfranchised by the “White Pri- 
mary” system. In the face of these 
facts, does it pay deliberately to mis- 
represent the truth ? 


OPPORTUNITY. 


FRIEND of our Association 
A writes: “While I heartily ap- 
prove of the colored people 
being given an opportunity to improve 
their condition, I feel that after doing 
what I can to help them to earn a liv- 
ing honorably, they must depend on 
their own resources to advance them- 
selves.” This is the attitude of many 
excellent friends of humanity, but it 
assumes that if a man is fairly 
equipped for earning a living to-day he 
will have the opportunity to do so, and 
that the paths before him will be open 
so as to make the rise of the deserving 
possible. 

It is precisely because the oppor- 
tunity to earn a living, even for those 
equipped to do so, is not given to-day 
to thousands of colored people in the 
United States, that the National Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Col- 
ored People exists. It is wrong and 
wasteful to do for people what they 
can and ought to do for. themselves, 
but when the doors of opportunity are 
so shut in their faces so as to discour- 
age and keep back the hard-working 
and deserving, then action is called for. 

To-day Negroes may work freely as 
menials at low wages; they may work 
freely as farm laborers under condi- 
tions of semi-slavery ; higher than that 
they meet unusual difficulties—the dif- 
ficulty of saving capital from low 
wages to farm or go into business; the 
difficulty of securing admission to the 
trades even when competent; the diffi- 
culty of securing protection under the 
law and of rearing a family in de- 
cency; the difficulty of educating their 


children; the difficulty of protecting 
their rights by the ballot. To be sure, 
if they are unusually gifted and push- 
ing they may push higher at the risk 
of insult and bitter opposition. Thus 
the fact remains that the mass of the 
willing, eager workers of the race are 
held back and forced down by a deep 
and growing race prejudice, and these, 
pressing down on the lower strata, en- 
courage in them laziness and vagrancy 
and crime. The National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored Peo- 
ple is an organization for giving the 
colored race a reasonable opportunity 
to help itself. 


SCHOOLS. 


HE philanthropist of a city like 

| New York is bewildered and 

often exasperated by the de- 

mands and begging of colored schools 
in the South. 

To some extent this is inevitable, 
and is due to the fact that the United 
States is undertaking to give elemen- 
tary education to a race of ten million 
people very largely by private philan- 
thropy instead of making this a State 
and even a national charge, and leav- 
ing to voluntary effort the college 
work and work of social uplift. 

But beyond this the philanthropic 
world is to some extent itself to blame 
because of the encouragement it gives 
to unknown and unvouched-for enter- 
prises and to unwise and unjustifiable 
attempts to duplicate existing founda- 
tions. 

The representative of a great fund 
once called on the writer and ex- 
pressed great sorrow that an alleged 
school in the South to which one of 
the most prominent New York phi- 
lanthropists had given $5,000 was 
found on investigation to be no school 
at all. This was unfortunate, but 
there are hundreds of good and de- 
serving schools starving for help 
which this philanthropist did not give 
to because their representatives did not 
appear so glib or plausible. It is not 
the smoothest talker who necessarily 
is doing the best work. 

Again, indiscriminate and ill-advised 
giving encourages such things as are

20 THE CRISIS 


happening in Atlanta. Atlanta needs 
public elementary schools, but it does 
not need more private schools. The 
existing schools are equipped for ex- 
cellent work in industries, agriculture, 
college training and some professional 
work. With adequate help and en- 
dowment they could do splendid work. 

Because, however, one man deserv- 
edly lost his job at one of these great 
schools, he is attempting to found a 
new school in Atlanta and unneces- 
sarily duplicate this work. Soon he 
will appear in New York asking funds, 
and without investigation or thought 
many will give. When they find their 
efforts wasted the deserving schools 
will suffer. 

There is crying need of an impar- 
tial, thoroughly reliable directory of 
educational and philanthropic effort 
among Negroes, a central information 
bureau on broad lines, with maps and 
figures at command which could fur- 
nish unbiased facts. The National 
Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People is ready to undertake 
such a work immediately on a small 
scale, and to expand it whenever it can 
get the necessary support. 


THE OLD STORY. 
HERE is without doubt a large 
I criminal and semi-criminal class 
among colored people. This is 
but another way of saying that the 
social uplift of a group of freedmen is 
a serious task. But it is also true, and 
painfully true, that the crime imputed 
carelessly and recklessly against col- 
ored people gives an impression of far 
greater criminality than the facts war- 

rant. 

Take, for instance, a typical case: 
A little innocent schoolgirl is brutally 
murdered in New Jersey. A Negro 
vagabond is arrested. Immediately 
the news is heralded from East to 
West, from North to South, in Eu- 
rope and Asia, of the crime of this 
black murderer. Immediately a fren- 
zied, hysterical mob gathers and at- 
tempts to lynch the poor wretch. He 
is spirited away and the public is 
almost sorry that he has escaped sum- 
mary justice. Without counsel or 
friends, the man is shut up in prison 


and tortured to make him confess. 
“They did pretty near everything to 
me except kill me,’ whispered the 
wretched man to the first friend he 
saw. 

Finally, after the whole black race 
in America had suffered aspersion for 
several weeks, sense begins to dawn in 
Jersey. After all, what proof was 
there against this man? He was lazy, 
he had been in jail for alleged theft 
from gypsies, he was good natured, 
and he drank whiskey. That was all. 
Yet he stayed in jail under no charge 
and under universal censure. The 
coroner's jury found no evidence to 
indict him. Still he lay in jail. 
Finally the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People 
stepped in and said, ‘““What are you 
holding this man for?” The Public 
Prosecutor got red in the face and 
vociferated. Then he went down- 
town, and when the habeas corpus pro- 
ceedings came and the judge asked 
again: “Why are you holding this 
man?’ the prosecutor said chirpily, 
“For violating election laws,” and 
brought a mass of testimony. Then 
the judge discharged the prisoner 
from the murder charge and congratu- 
lated the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People—but 
the man is still in jail. 

Such justice is outrageous and such 
methods disgraceful. Black folk are 
willing to shoulder their own sins, but 
the difference between a vagabond and 
a murderer is too tremendous to be 
lightly ignored. 


“SOCIAL EQUALITY.” 


T last we have a definition of 
A the very elusive phrase ‘Social 
Equality” as applied to the Ne- 
gro problem. In stating their griev- 
ances colored people have recently 
specified these points: 
1. Disfranchisement, even of edu- 
cated Negroes. 
2. Curtailment of common school 
training. 
3. Confinement to “Ghettos.” 
4. Discrimination in wages. 
5. Confinement to menial employ- 
ment.

have with singular unanimity hastened 
to call this complaint an unequivocal 
demand for “social equality,” and as 
such absolutely inadmissible. We are 
glad to have a frank definition, be- 
cause we have always suspected this 
smooth phrase. We recommend on 
this showing that hereafter colored 
men who hasten to disavow any desire 
for “social equality” should carefully 
read the above list of disabilities which 
social inequality would seem to pre- 
scribe. 


ASHAMED. 


NY colored man who complains 
A of the treatment he receives in 

America is apt to be faced 
sooner or later by the statement that 
he is ashamed of his race. 

The statement usually strikes him 
as a most astounding piece of illogical 
reasoning, to which a hot reply is ap- 
propriate. 

And yet notice the curious logic of 


the persons who say such things. 
They argue: 

White men alone are men. This 
Negro wants to be a man. Ergo he 
wants to be a white man. 

Their attention is drawn to the 


efforts of colored people to be treated 
decently. This minor premise there- 
fore attracts them. But the major 
premise—the question as to treating 
black men like white men—never en- 
ters their heads, nor can they conceive 
it entering the black man’s head. If 
he wants to be a man he must want 
to be white, and therefore it is with 
peculiar complacency that a Tennessee 
paper says of a dark champion of 
Negro equality: “He bitterly resents 
his Negro blood.” 

Not so, O Blind Man. He bitterly 
resents your treatment of Negro 
blood. The prouder he is, or has a 
right to be, of the blood of his black 


fathers, the more doggedly he resists 
the attempt to load men of that blood 
with ignominy and chains. It is race 
pride that fights for freedom; it is the 
man ashamed of his blood who weakly 
submits and smiles. 


JESUS CHRIST IN BALTIMORE. 


T seems that it is not only Prop- 
I erty that is screaming with fright 

at the Black Spectre in Baltimore, 
but Religion also. Two churches 
founded in the name of Him who 
“put down the mighty from their seats 
and exalted them of low degree” are 
compelled to move. Their palatial edi- 
fices filled with marble memorials and 
Tiffany windows are quite useless for 
the purposes of their religion since 
black folk settled next door. Inconti- 
nently they have dropped their Bibles 
and gathered up their priestly robes 
and fled, after selling their property to 
colored people for $125,000 in good, 
cold cash. 

Where are they going? Uptown. 
Up to the wealthy and exclusive and 
socially select. There they will estab- 
lish their little gods again, and learned 
prelates with sonorous voices will ask 
the echoing pews: “How can the 
Church reach the working man?” 

Why not ask the working man? 
Why not ask black people, and yellow 
people, and poor people, and all the 
people from whom such congregations 
flee in holy terror? The church that 
does not run from the lowly finds the 
lowly at its doors, and there are some 
such churches in the land, but we fear 
that their number in Baltimore is not 
as great as should be. 


“EXCEPT SERVANTS.” 


HE noticeable reservation in all 

| attempts, North and South, to 

separate black folk and white 

is the saving phrase, “Except ser- 
vants.” 

Are not servants colored? Is the 
objection, then, to colored people or to 
colored people who are not servants? 
In other words, is this race prejudice 
inborn antipathy or a social and eco- 
nomic caste? 








SOCIAL CONTROL 


By JANE ADDAMS, of Hull House 





write upon the great race prob- 

lem which we have in America. 
I think, on the whole, that the most 
satisfactory books on the subject are 
written by people outside of America. 
This is certainly true of two books, 
“White Capital and Black Labor,” by 
the Governor of Jamaica, and William 
Archer’s book entitled ‘A fro-mer- 
ica.” Although the latter is inconclu- 
sive, it at least gives one the impres- 
sion that the man who has written it 
has seen clearly into the situation, and 
that, I suppose, is what it is very diff- 
cult for any American to do. 


epic 0p find it very difficult to 


One thing, however, is clear to all of 
us, that not only in the South, but 
everywhere in America, a strong race 
antagonism is asserting itself, which 
has various modes of lawless and inso- 
lent expression. The contemptuous 
attitude of the so-called superior race 
toward the inferior results in a social 
segregation of each race, and puts the 
one race group thus segregated quite 
outside the influences of social control 
respresented by the other. Those in- 
herited resources of the race embod- 
ied in custom and kindly intercourse 
which make much more for social re- 
straint than does legal enactment it- 
self are thus made operative only 
upon the group which has inherited 
them, and the newer group which 
needs them most is practically left 
without. Thus in every large city we 
have a colony of colored people who 
have not been brought under social 
control, and a majority of the white 
people in the same community are 
tacitly endeavoring to keep from them 
those restraints which can be com- 
municated only through social inter- 
course. One could easily illustrate 
this lack of inherited control by com- 
paring the experiences of a group of 
colored girls with those of a group 
representing the daughters of Italian 


immigrants, or of any other South 
European peoples. The Italian girls 
very much enjoy the novelty of factory 
work, the opportunity to earn money 
and to dress as Americans do, but this 
new freedom of theirs is carefully 
guarded. Their mothers seldom give 
them permission to g 1 
the evening, and never without chape- 
ronage. Their fathers consider it a 
point of honor that their daughters 
shall not be alone on the streets after 
dark. The daughter of the humblest 
Italian receives this care because her 
parents are but carrying out social tra- 
ditions. A group of colored girls, on 
the other hand, are quite without this 
protection. If they yield more easily 
to the temptations of a city than any 
other girls, who shall say how far the 
lack of social restraint is responsible 
for their downfall? The Italian pa- 
rents represent the social traditions 
which have been worked out during 
centuries of civilization, and which 
often become a deterrent to progress 
through the very bigotry with which 
they cling to them; nevertheless, it is 
largely through these customs and 
manners that new groups are assimi- 
lated into civilization. 

Added to this is the fact that a de- 
cent colored family, if it is also poor, 
often finds it difficult to rent a house 
save one that is undesirable, because 
situated near a red-light district, and 
the family in the community least 
equipped with social tradition is forced 
to expose its daughters to the most fla- 
grantly immoral conditions the com- 
munity permits. This is but one of the 
many examples of the harmful effects 
of race segregation which might be 
instanced. 

Another result of race antagonism 
is the readiness to irritation which in 
time characterizes the intercourse of 
the two races. We stupidly force one 
race to demand as a right from the 


t 
xO 


tO a party in 


SOCIAL CONTROL 23 


other those things which should be ac- 
corded as a courtesy, and every meet- 
ing between representatives of the two 
races is easily characterized by inso- 
lence and arrogance. To the friction 
of city life, and the complications of 
modern intercourse, is added this 
primitive race animosity which should 
long since have been outgrown. When 
the white people in a city are tacitly 
leagued against the colored people 
within its borders, the result is sure to 
be disastrous, but there are still 
graver dangers in permitting the prim- 
itive instinct to survive and to become 
self-assertive. When race antagonism 
manifests itself through lynching, it 
defiantly insists that it is superior to 
all those laws which have been grad- 
ually evolved during thousands of 
years, and which form at once the rec- 
ord and the instrument of civilization. 
The fact that this race antagonism en- 
ables the men acting under its impul- 
sion to justify themselves in their law- 
lessness constitutes the great danger 
of the situation. The men claim that 
they are executing a primitive retribu- 
tion which precedes all law, and in 
this belief they put themselves in a 
position where they cannot be rea- 


soned with, although this dangerous 
manifestation must constantly be reck- 
oned with as a deterrent to progress 
and a menace to orderly living. More- 
over, this race antagonism is very close 
to the one thing in human relations 
which is uglier than itself, namely, sex 
antagonism, and in every defense 
made in its behalf an appeal to the lat- 
ter antagonism is closely interwoven. 
Many men in every community justify 
violence when it is committed under 
the impulsion of these two antag- 
onisms, and others carelessly assert 
that great laws of human intercourse, 
first and foremost founded upon jus- 
tice and right relations between man 
and man, should thus be disregarded 
and destroyed. 

If the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People will 
soberly take up every flagrant case of 
lawbreaking, and if it allow no with- 
drawal of constitutional rights to pass 
unchallenged, it will perform a most 
useful service to America and for the 
advancement of all its citizens. Many 
other opportunities may be open in 
time to such an association, but is not 
this its first and most obvious obliga- 
tion?

THE TEACHER. 


By Lesuizé PinckNEy HI. 


Lord, who am I to teach the way 
To little children day by day, 
So prone myself to go astray? 


I teach them Knowledge, but I know 
How faint they flicker, and how low 
The candles of my knowledge glow. 


IT teach them Power to will and do, 
But only now to learn anew 


My own great weakness through and through. 


I teach them Lowe for all mankind 
And all God’s creatures; but I find 
My love comes lagging still behind. 


Lord, if their guide I still must be, 
O let the little children see 
The teacher leaning hard on thee! 








Employment of Colored Women in Chicago 


From a Study Made by the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy 





In considering the field of employment 
for colored women, the professional women 
must be discussed separately. They admit 
fewer difficulties and put a brave face on 
the matter, but in any case their present 
position was gained only after a long strug- 
gle. The education is the less difficult part. 
The great effort is to get the work after 
having prepared themselves for it. The 
Negro woman, like her white sister, is con- 
stantly forced to choose between a lower 
wage or no work. The pity is that her 
own people do not know the colored girl 
needs their help nor realize how much they 
could do for her. 


Two of the musicians found the struggle 
too hard and were compelled to leave Chi- 
cago. One girl of twenty-three, a graduate 
ot the Chicago Conservatory of Music, is 
playing in a low concert hall in one of the 
worst sections of the city, from 8 in the 
evening till 4 in the morning. Her wages 
are $18 a week, and with this she supports 
a father and mother and younger sister. 

There are from fifteen to twenty colored 
teachers in the public schools of Chicago. 
This information was obtained from the 
office of the superintendent, where it was 
said no record was kept of the number of 
colored teachers. When they are given such 
a place they are always warned that they 
are likely to have difficulty. As a rule they 
are in schools where the majority of the 
children are Negroes. They are all in the 
grades, but they say that their opportuni- 
ties for promotion are equal to those of 
white women. Indeed, they say that there 
are two places where they are not discrim- 
inated against because of their color. One 
is in the public schools, the other is under 
the Civil Service Commission, 

However, the professional women do not 
have the greatest difficulty. The real bar- 
riers are met by the women who have had 
only an average education—girls who have 
finished high school, or perhaps only the 
eighth grade. These girls, if they were 
white, would find employment at clerical 
and office work in Chicago’s department 
stores, mail order houses and wholesale 
stores. But these positions are absolutely 
closed to the Negro girl. She has no 
choice -but housework. 

When the object of the inquiry was ex- 
plained to one woman she said: “Why, no 
one wants a Negro to work for him. I'll 
show you—look in the newspaper.” And 
she produced a paper with its columns of 
advertisements for help wanted. “See, 
not one person in this whole city has asked 
for a Negro to work for him.” 

A great many of the colored women find 


what they call “day work” most satisfac- 
tory. This means from eight to nine hours 
a day at some kind of housework, cleaning, 
washing, ironing or dusting. This the 
Negro women prefer to regular positions 
as maids, because it allows them to go at 
night to their families. The majority of 
the women who do this work receive $1.50, 
with 10 cents extra for carfare. There 
was a higher grade of day work for which 
the pay was $2 a day besides the carfare. 
This included the packing of trunks, wash- 
ing of fine linen and lace curtains, and even 
some mending. 

The records of the South Side Free Em- 
ployment Agency showed that the wages of 
colored women were uniformly lower than 
those of white women. Of course, there is 
no way of judging of ability by records, 
but where the white cooks received $8 per 
week the Negro cooks were paid $7, and 
where the white maids received $6, some- 
times, but not as frequently as in the case 
of the cooks, the Negro maid received less. 
One dollar and a half was paid for “day 
work.” At the colored employment agency 
which is run in connection with the Fred- 
eric Douglas Centre they have many more 
requests for maids than they have girls to 
fill the places. Good places with high wages 
are sometimes offered, but the girls are 
more and more demanding “day work” and 
refusing to work by the week. At the 
South Side Free Employment Agency dur- 
ing the months of January, February and 
March of this year forty-two positions for 
colored women were found.* These forty- 
two positions were filled by thirty-six 
women, some of them coming back to the 
office two or three times during the three 
months. The superintendent said it was 
difficult to find places for the colored 
women who applied, and they probably suc- 
ceeded in placing only about 25 per cent. of 
them. In the opinion of those finding the 
work for the girls in this office, the reason 
for the difficulties they encounter are the 
fact that they do not remain long in one 
place and have a general reputation for 
dishonesty. The fundamental cause of the 
discrimination by employers against them 
is racial prejudice either in the employer 
himself or in his customers. 

One girl who has only a trace of colored 
blood was able to secure a position as sales- 
girl in a store. After she had been there a 
long time she asked for an increase in 
wages, such as had been allowed the white 
girls, but the request was refused and she 
was told that she ought to be thankful that 
they kept her at all.

EMPLOYMENT OF COLORED WOMEN IN CHICAGO 25 


In many cases, especially when the 
women were living alone, the earnings, plus 
the income from the lodgers, barely cov- 
ered the rent. When they work by the 
day they rarely work more than four days 
a week. Sometimes the amount they gave 
as their weekly wage fell short of even 
paying the rent, but more often the rent 
was covered and a very small margin left 
to live on. 

Such treatment has discouraged the 
Negro woman, She has accepted the con- 
ditions and seldom makes any real effort to 
get into other sorts of work. The twelfth 
question on the schedule, “What attempts 
have you made to secure other kinds of 
work in Chicago or elsewhere?” was usually 
answered by a question: “What’s the use 
of trying to get work when you know 
you can’t get it?” 

The colored women are like white women 
in the same grade of life. They do not 
realize the need of careful training, and 
they do not appreciate the advantages of 
specialization in their work. But the 
Negro woman is especially handicapped, for 
she not only lacks training but must over- 
come the prejudice against her color. Of 
the 270 women interviewed, 43 per cent. 
were doing some form of housework for 
wages, yet all evidence of conscious train- 
ing was entirely lacking. This need must 
be brought home to them before they can 
expect any real advancement. 

A peculiar problem presents itself in con- 
nection with the housework. Practically 
this is the only occupation open to Negro 
wome.., and it is also the only occupation 
where one is not expected to go home at 
night. This the Negroes insist on doing. 
They are accused of having no family feel- 
ing, yet the fact remains that they will ac- 
cept a lower wage and live under far less 
advantageous conditions for the sake of 
being free at night. That is why the “day 
work” is so popular. Rather than live in 
some other person’s home and get good 
wages for continued service, the colored 
woman prefers to live in this way. She will 
have a tiny room, go out as many days a 
week as she can get places, and pay for her 
room and part of her board out of her 
earnings, which sometimes amount to only 
$3 or $4.50 per week. 

Occasionally laundry, sewing or hair 
work is done in their homes, but the day 
work is almost universally preferred. 

Many of the Negroes are so nearly white 
that they can be mistaken for white girls, 
in which case they are able to secure very 


good positions and keep them as long as 
their color is not known. 

One girl worked for a fellowship at the 
Art Institute. Her work was good and the 
place was promised her. In making out the 
papers she said Negro, when asked her 
nationality, to the great astonishment of the 
man in charge. He said he would have to 
look into the matter, but the girl did not 
get the fellowship 

A young man, son of a colored minister 
in the city, had a position in a business 
man’s office, kept the books, collected rents, 
etc. He had a peculiar name, and one ot 
the tenants remembered it in connection 
with the boy’s father, who had all the 
physical characteristics of the Negro. The 
tenant made inquiries and reported the mat- 
ter to the landlord, threatening to leave the 
building if he had to pay rent to a Negro. 
The boy was discharged. 

A colored girl, who was very light col 
ored, said that more than once she secured 
a place and the colored people themselves 
had told the employer he had a “Negro” 
working for him. The woman with whom 
sne was living said: “It’s true every time. 
The Negroes are their own worst enemies.” 

To summarize, the isolation which is 
forced upon the Negro, both in his social 
and his business life, constitutes one of the 
principal difficulties which he encounters. 
As far as the colored woman is concerned, 
as we have shown, the principal occupa 
tions which are open to her are domestic 
service and school teaching. This leaves a 
large number of women whose education 
has given them ambitions beyond house- 
work, who are not fitted to compete with 
northern teachers and yet cannot obtain 
clerical work because they are Negroes. 
Certain fields in which there is apparently 
an opportunity for the colored women are 
little tried. For example, sewing is profit- 
able and there is little feeling against the 
employment of Negro seamstresses, and yet 
few follow the dressmaking profession. 

Without doubt one fundamental reason 
for the difficulties the colored woman meets 
in seeking employment is her lack of indus- 
trial training. The white woman suffers 
from this also, but the colored woman 
doubly so. The most hopeful sign is the 
growing conviction on the part of the lead- 
ing Negro women of the city that there is 
need of co-operation between them and the 
uneducated and unskilled, and that they are 
trying to find some practical means to give 
to these women the much-needed training 
for industrial life.

The policy usually carried out consist- 
ently in the South of refusing the colored 
woman the courtesies accorded the white 
woman leads to some unfortunate results. 
One of the courtesies refused is the title 
of “Mrs.” or “Miss.” Thus a Kentucky 
newspaper, in its recent educational news, 
notes “the resignation of Mrs. Mattie 
Spring Barr as a substitute teacher and the 
unanimous election of Miss Ella Wil- 
liams,” while a few paragraphs below it 
says that “Principal Russell of the Russell 
Negro School asked that Lizzie Brooks be 
promoted to the position of regular 
teacher and that Annie B. Jones be made 
a substitute.” Here we have two groups of 
women doing similar important work for 
the community, yet the group with Negro 
blood is denied the formality of address 
that every other section of the countrv 
gives to the teacher in a public school. 


How much the South loses by this policy 
is shown by a Northerner’s experience in 
the office of one of the philanthropic socie- 
ties. ‘Two probation officers, volunteers, 
were going out to their work. The secre 
tary of the society addressed the first, a 
white woman, as Mrs. Brown; the second, 
a little middle-aged black woman, he called 
Mary. When they had left the Northerner 
questioned the difference in address. “I 
couldn’t call a nigger Mrs. or Miss.” the 
secretary expostulated. “It would be im- 
possible.” “But here in your own city,” the 


BURDEN 


Northerner answered, “I happen to know a 
number of educated colored girls, some of 
them college graduates, who have a desire 
for social service. Under you they might 
learn the best methods of charitable work, 
but they would not care to be called ‘Annie’ 
or ‘Jane’ by a young white man. Can you 
afford to lose such helpers as these?” 

He had but one answer. “It would never 
do for me to say Mrs. or Miss to a nigger. 
It would be impossible.” 


Throughout the country there are a num- 
ber of colored postal clerks. These men, 
with others in the service, belong to the 


Mutual Benefit Association. At a recent 
meeting in Chicago the delegates to this 
Mutual Benefit Association voted in the 


future to admit only clerks of the Cauca 
sian race. According to one of the col- 
ored clerks, the meeting that passed this 
vote was “packed,” colored members re- 
ceiving no notice to elect delegates to it. 


The black servant is more acceptable to 
some people than the educated colored man. 
As an instance of this is Mr. U. of Wash- 
ington, a highly cultivated Negro of some 
means. As owner of a cottage and a few 
acres of land in a small Virginia town, he 
good-naturedly allowed an _ old black 
woman to live rent-free upon his place. 
On her death he went down to claim the 
property, but found the woman’s daughter 
had put in a counter claim. The case went 
to court, and in his plea before the jury 
the woman’s lawyer said: “Are you going 
to take property away from this black 
mammy’s daughter to give it to a smart 
nigger from Washington?” And despite 
Mr. U.’s former yearly payment of taxes. 
despite the deed which he himself held, he 
lost his suit. 


In Wilcox County. Ala., there are 10,758 
Negro children and 2,000 white children of 
school age, making a total population of 
12,758. The per capita allowance for each 
child in the State this year is $2.56. Ac 
cording to the recent apportionment of the 
school fund on this basis, Wilcox County 
receives $32,660.48. Of this amount the 
10,758 Negro children have been allowed 
one-fifth, or $6,532.09, about 60 cents each, 
while the 2,000 white children receive the 
remaining four-fifths, or $26,128.39, about 
$13 each. Further investigation shows that 
only 1,000 of the 10,758 Negro children are 
in school, leaving 6.758 with absolutely no 
provision for obtaining even a common 
school education

TALKS ABOUT WOMEN 


NUMBER TWO 


A most interesting and instructive morn- 
ing was given at the*Berkeley Lyceum on 
Wednesday, December 7, under the aus- 
pices of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People. The 
weather was bitterly cold, and although 
tne great fall of snow during the night 
had made getting about a not only trouble- 
some but dangerous experience, the little 
theatre was well filled with many well- 
known women in sympathy with the cause 
and interested in all sorts of activities for 
progress. The chairman, Mr. John Haynes 
Holmes, introduced Madame Hackley, who 
gave the musical part of the program, and 
did it well with her customary finish and 
appreciation. 

Madam Hackley was trained in Paris, 
and gave several French selections with 
great skill. 

Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, the speaker, 
was most enthusiastically received, and 
made, as usual, a most effective and touch- 
ing speech, to which her audience listened 
with not only interest but surprise, as many 
present had never dreamed of the strug- 
gles of these women in their efforts for 
educational advancement. 

Without doubt Mrs. Terrell is one of the 
best orators we have to-day. She has 
much dignity, with a very easy and fluent 
mode of speaking. She is direct, and 
when, as on this occasion, she is talking for 
the women of her race, her enthusiasm and 
sincerity carry conviction to her listeners. 
When she had finished Mrs. Terrell was 
warmly congratulated, and the enthusiastic 
daughter of the great orator, Robert Inger- 
soll, Mrs. Walston R. Brown, declared that 
“Mrs. Terrell must tell her story again to 
a larger and fuller audience.” In her re- 
marks Mrs. Terrell told of the obstacles 
which confront colored women and girls 
in their efforts to better their conditions. 
Often having to battle against this great 
evil of race prejudice which yet lingers in 
our land and which so often stands in the

way of progress for these women, not only, 
said Mrs. Terrell, must she struggle with 
the handicap of color, but only too often 
she gets no sympathy from the white 
woman, who should be at least willing to 
give a helping hand to these colored friends 
who, like herself, are more or less looking 
forward to perfect freedom and all which 
that means for womanhood. The speaker 
thought that right here was a big field for 
the American woman’s activities, and hoped 
for the co-operation of her. white friends. 

Mrs. Stanton Blatch, who was in the 
audience, made a short but forceful speech 
for the cause of women, and thougnt “the 
vote” would help along quicker than any- 
thing else all reforms of this or any other 
nature. The secretary of the Trades 
Woman's League also spoke, and declared 
that she would do her part toward opening 
the doors of her association to all women, 
whether white or colored. 


After a most delightful rendering of sev- 
eral Negro melodies, Mrs. Hackley told 
how she so much hoped to establish a school 
of music for her people. No one hearing 
Ler direct, simple and earnest story Coubted 
for a moment her ultimate success in this 
worthy effort, and she most certainly will 
have the co-operation of every musical 
member of her audience. 

The chairman made a few remarks with 
his usual dignity and precision, and the first 
musical morning was voted a real success. 
[hose having boxes were Mrs. Villard, Mrs. 
FE. W. Harkness, Mrs. Paul M. Warburg, 
Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, Mrs. Robert Inger- 
soll, whose daughter, Miss Maud, acted as 
one of the ushers; Mrs. Ida Husted Harper, 
Mrs. Frederick Nathan, Mrs. Frances R. 
Keyser, Mrs. Charles W. Anderson, to- 
gether with many other well-known women, 
white and colored. 

The arrangements were in charge of Miss 
Frances Blascoer, executive secretary of 
the Association. 


WW 


The annual report of British East Africa 
for the year 1908-09, which was issued a 
few months ago, states that the period was 
not marked by any salient events, but the 
Protectorate had made steady progress in 
spite of weather conditions somewhat un- 
favorable to agriculture. There had been 
little or no friction with native tribes. 
Labor difficulties still exist, but show a 
tendency to diminish. European overseers 


of the native railway laborers have proved 
far more satisfactory than the Indians for- 
merly employed. 

The report says of slavery: 

“The ordinance for the abolition of the 
legal status of slavery has worked well and 
without friction during the year. Alto- 
gether 3,593 cases have been settled by 
the District Courts, and compensation to 
the amount of £7,053 has been awarded.”

THE LADY OF THE SLAVE STATES 

Mrs. George Haven Putnam, in a very 
charming essay in the Contemporary Re- 
view for December, discusses “The Lady 
of the Slave States.” She deals gently 
enough with her subject; she says that the 
slave-owner’s wife like everybody else with 
slavery was blighted by its curse, but she 
demolished very effectually the myth of 
the gracious fascinating woman of culture 
who ruled family and estate by the charm 
of her personality. 


The ante-bellum Southern 
had much to say for herself and was in 
short not “the Gothic saint in her niche” 
that tradition pictures, but a kindly little 
creature surrounded by “Orientalism” and 
little better off, so far as opportunities for 
development went, than any lady of the 
harem. 

Mrs. Putnam quotes Miss Martineau, who 


lady never 


traveled extensively through the slave 
States, to show how the system limited 
the white women and made them “the 
greatest slaves on the plantation.” Pa- 


tience was the supreme virtue of the ante 
bellum lady—they made the best of a bad 
state of affairs. Logic she had little or 
none, and her up-bringing tended to make 
her a delightful girl but a middle-aged 
woman of only moderate attractions, And 
while she was often very kind to her slaves 
her sensibilities seemed in some measure 
blunted by perpetual sight of suffering and 
injustice 

When the war ended the ex-mistresses of 
slaves showed how good was the material 
that had been buried under the “Oriental- 
ism” of the plantation. 


RACE PREJUDICE IN THE ORIENT. 


Race Prejudice: An address by Melville 
E. Stone to the Quill Club, New York City 

The best review of this remarkable little 
pamphlet will be a few extracts from its 
pages: 

What is to be the outcome? What does 
all this mean for the future of the world? 
Let us view the problem from the political, 
the commercial and the moral aspects 
How long will the 6,000 soldiers we have 
in the Philippines be able to keep our flag 


afloat among 8,000,000 of natives? How 
long will the 75,000 English soldiers in 
India be able to maintain British sover 


eignty over 300,000,000 of Asians? Believe 
me, these are not idle questions. They are 
up to us for an answer, whether we will or 
no, and upon our ability to make answer 
will depend the future of what we are 
pleased to call our Western civilization. I 
would not be an alarmist, and yet I would 
have you feel that Macauley’s suggestion of 
the New Zealander on a broken arch of 
London Bridge, sketching the ruins of St. 
Paul, has come to be more than an extrav- 
agant figure of speech. And I am con- 
vinced that there is real danger awaiting 
us unless we mend our ways. It is not 
the Asian who needs educating; it is the 
European. I am not worrying half so 


much about the heathen in his blindness as 
I am about the Christian in his blindness.

WHAT TO READ 29 


Asia is gwake and preparing for the com- 
ing struggle. And we are doing very much 
to force the issue and to prepare her for 
the contest. For a century we have been 
sending at enormous cost our missionaries 
to all parts of the hemisphere to civilize. 
There may be doubt as to the amount of 
proselyting we have been able to accom- 
plish; there can be no possible doubt of the 
work we have done to strengthen the 
Asian people politically and commercially. 

We shall never meet the problems grow- 
ing out of our relation with the Far East 
unless we absolutely and once for all put 
away race prejudice. I believe the Euro- 
pean snob in Asia is distinctly the enemy of 
the civilized West. And his coadjutor in 
this country is a fitting criminal yoke-fel- 
low. Let me give you some illustrations 
of what I mean—cases which came under 
my personal observation. From Bombay 
to Yokohama there is not a social club at 
any port or treaty point where a native, 
whatever his culture or refinement, will be 
admitted. At the Bengal Club at Calcutta 
last year a memiber in perfectly good stand- 
ing innocently invited an Eurasian gentle- 
man—that is, one who is half native and 
half European—to dine with him. It be- 
came known that the invitation had been 
extended, and a storm of opposition broke 
among the members. The matter was 
finally adjusted by setting aside the ladies’ 
department of the club, and there the of- 
fending member and his unfortunate guest 
dined alone. The next day the member 
was called before the board of governors 
and notified that another like breach of the 
rules would result in his expulsion. The 
beating of native servants and workmen in 
India is a daily and hourly occurrence. It 
formerly was so at Hong Kong and Shang 
hai, but Mr. Sprague, the representative of 
the Standard Oil Company at Shanghai, 
told me that since the Russo-Japanese war 
the natives would not stand it, and that all 
beating of them by Europeans in that city 
had ceased. 

The son of a maharaja goes to England, 
is educated at Oxford or Cambridge, is 
lionized in the West End of London—may 
hap he is honored with an invitation to 
Windsor. When he goes back home he 
may enter no white man’s club; if he be 
fortunate enough to be invited to a white 
man’s function. no white woman will dance 
or associate with him; and if by any luck 
he should marry a European, he, his wife 
and his children become outcasts. AI- 
though native troops, like the Sikhs, have 
shown undying loyalty to the British flag 
and on frequent occasions have exhibited 
courage in the highest degree, no one of 
them ever has or ever can achieve the Vic- 
toria Cross. 

Socially they are all saying to us: “Stop 
cheating us, stop swindling us, stop your 
treating us as your inferiors who are to be 
beaten and robbed.” Japan is crying out, 
“Treat us fairly and we will go more than 
half-way. Leave to us the question 


whether Japanese laborers shall go to 
America to annoy you, and we will stop 
them. But do not say that you will admit 
the lazaroni of Hungary and Italy and 
Russia, simply because they are white, and 
shut us out because we are yellow.” 

The Sinhalese, natives of Ceylon, while 
I was in Colombo, addressed a remarkable 
communication to the Governor-General. 
They said a hundred years ago there was 
established in the United States a new 
theory of government—that there should 
be no taxation without representation. 
“Now,” they said, “we ask a share in the 
government of the island. We pay taxes. 
You may fix a property qualification and 
say that no one having less than a thou- 
sand pounds sterling shall share in the gov 
ernment. We shall not object. You may 
also fix an educational qualification. You 
may say that no one but a_ college 
graduate shall take part in the govern- 
ment. We will not object. In short, you 
may fix any qualification except a 
racial qualification. That would not be 
fair.” “And what answer have you to 
make?” [ asked Mr. Crosby Rolles, editor 
of The Times of Ceylon. “To meet their 
request,” he replied, “would mean to turn 
over the government of Ceylon to them at 
once, because there are 6,000 of them and 
only 5,000 English men, women and chil- 
dren. We must stop educating them.” 

What do you think of that for a remedy? 
Personally, I do not think it will work, any 
more than I think any rule of arbitrary re- 
pression can endure. I cannot bring myself 
to sympathize altogether with the views ex- 
pressed by Mr. Roosevelt in his recent 
Guildhall speech. I take refuge in what 
seems to me the larger experience and riper 
judgment of Lord Curzon of Kedleston, 
who in July, 1904, was also given the free- 
dom of the City of London in Guildhall, 
and on that occasion used these words: 
“Depend upon it, you will never rule the 
East except through the heart, and the mo- 
ment imagination has gone out of your 
Asiatic policy your empire will dwindle and 
decay. 

“In smug complacency you may close 
your doors which look toward Asia, while 
you open wide those which look toward 
Europe; you may refuse the Oriental ad- 
mission to your schools, while you accord 
the privilege to any child of a European; 
you may pile import duties mountain high, 
and raise our standards of living to any 
pitch of extravagance; you may build war- 
ships without limit, and you may continue 
to treat the Asian as legitimate prey. But 
I am confident that it will not avail. 


“As a soldier, whether at Omdurman, in 
the Sudan, or on 203-Metre Hill, at Port 
Arthur, the man of color has shown him- 
self a right good fighting man; in com- 
merce he has, by his industry, perseverance, 
ingenuity and frugality, given us pause; 
and before the eternal throne his temporal 
and his spiritual welfare are worth as much 
as yours and mine.”

JOHN T. MORSE, Editor of American Statesmen Series. 


‘*Perhaps in thus dramatically fashioning his volume Mr. Villard obeyed an instinct 
rather than acted upon a preconceived plan; that is often the case with great work, 
where a writer’s feelings are deeply enlisted. Be this as it may, the merit and 
charm are none the less; he has seized well a splendid opportunity and has 
written one of the great biographies of our literature.’’ 


HENRY WATTERSON in the Louisville ‘‘Courier-Journal’’ 


‘“‘No fault may justly be found with Mr. Villard’s telling of the story. It is 
minute and lucid, altogether fair and unvarnished.’’

How to Elevate the Moral and Civic 
Tone of the Negro Community 


Negroes—good, bad and indifferent—as long as they have lived in tenements, have 
had to live shamefully intermingled. Formerly they were forced to live in ramshackle 
tenements that had been abandoned by the whites, at exorbitant rents for wretched 
accommodations. But now, thanks to the thrift and enterprise of certain progressive 
Negro real estate agents, they may live in houses having the same conveniences and 
accommodations as the whites. While, happily, the physical surroundings of the Negro 
tenant have been radically altered, unhappily his moral surroundings remain unchanged. 
How, then, can we improve his moral surroundings? Co-operation is a sine qua non 
in the solution of this problem. Tenants MUST co-operate with their agents and 
agents MUST co-operate with one another in ameliorating the moral and civic condition 
of Negro communities. We can’t lean on the landlord. He is an indifferent third 
party. He cares not, so to speak, whether his house is tenanted with respectable or 
disrespectable tenants, so long as it is full and he gets his rents. If he’s at all concerned 
about the disrespectable or respectable tenants in his house, it’s only to the extent that 
he’s afraid the former may be the cause of some or all of the latter moving, thus 
leaving him with some vacancies. 

The present moral conditions of Negro tenantry are indeed bad. The individual 
efforts of certain Negro agents toward bettering the conditions have been praiseworthy, 
to say the least, but as far as making any progress toward the desired goal is concerned, 
such efforts must needs be and practically have been of little or no avail. What is 
the desirable goal is too obvious to command explanation. But how to reach that goal 
is the matter under consideration, In the first place, we repeat that the united efforts 
of tenants and agents are the desideratum. 

Let the agent compel a prospective tenant to furnish references satisfying fair 
and reasonable requirements as imposed by, agreed upon and accepted in toto by all 
agents. The respectable tenant will be glad to do it. Any tenant not furnishing such 
references should be “jim-crowed,” as it were, from decent neighborhoods. 

This matter of bettering the moral and civic condition of Negro communities is 
a case of a wheel within a wheel. As has been emphasized before, the agent can do 
absolutely nothing without co-operation. Ministers wielding great influence over large 
congregations can lend a powerfully helping hand, if they will. We must all pull 
together. We cannot work resultfully in factions. It is unquestionably within our 
power to do it, if all others do their respective parts and the colored real estate 
agent does his.

The New York and New Jersey 
Industrial Exchange, through its 
Employment Agency Department, 
furnishes more Colored Help to 
the leading families in the city 
and in the suburban towns than 
any other medium in New York. 

It is located in the acknowledged 
best section of the city, being in 
the Henry Phipps’ Model Tene- 
ments for Colored Families. No 
other Exchange is so well patron- 
ized by the foremost families, 
many of whom have never em- 
ployed Colored Help before. 

Our demand for competent 
Southern Help exceeds the supply 
many times over. Call and regis- 
ter. No charge. Bring your ref- 
erences. We can place you in a 
good position. If inconvenient to 
pay our required office fee, you are 
at liberty to take advantage of our 
Credit System. This new feature 
has proven extremely beneficial to 
many worthy persons seeking em- 
ployment.
