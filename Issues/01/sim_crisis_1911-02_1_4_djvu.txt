education and efforts for social uplift; the 
dissemination of literature; the holding of 
mass meetings; the maintenance of a lec- 
ture bureau; the encouragement of vigi-

plaints; the maintenance of a Bureau of 
Information; the publication of THE 
Crisis; the collection of facts and publi- 
cation of the truth.

persons are urged to join our organization 
—associate membership costs $1, and 
contributing and sustaining members pay

“I have read the first copy with interest.” 
THomAsS JESSE JONEs, 
Bureau of the Census, 
Washington, D. C. 


“I think THe Crisis has come to the 
kingdom just at the present time. Its in- 
formation in regard to the Negro in politics 
and their condition is certainly very helpful 
to any man who is interested in the condi- 
tion that is confronting our race of people 
in this country.” James H. Gorpon, 

Brooklyn, N. Y. 

“I wish to tell you how wonderfully well 
I think you have done with THE Crisis. It 
is stupendously strong in its repression. I 
have just read every word, including the 
advertisements.” WALTER E. WEYL, 

Woodstock, 
Ulster Co., N. Y. 


“T want the inclosed to tell you how much 
I like THE Crisis. Would that I could itali- 
cize my approbation with a great ainount. 
The little magazine is going to fill a great 
need, and will be to me personally a most 
instructive and interesting monthly visitor.”

THE CRISIS 


A Business 
Proposition 
Tue Crisis was established in September, 
1910, and has issued four copies. Its circu- 
lation has been as follows: 


November 


December .<.6.6.50+6 20 
FARMAN oc cocci es 3,000 * 
BPS INIRE ioscan ee etoet 4,000 


The demand for the magazine has stead- 
ily kept ahead of the supply, so that sample 
copies have not been available and agents 
often could not be supplied. 

The magazine circulates now in every 
State in the Union and in five foreign coun 
tries. In the near future it is planned to 
enlarge the size of the page of the maga- 
zine and to increase the number of pages 
so as to include more articles and some 
fiction. 


It is especially desired to increase the 
number and quality of the illustrations so 
as to make the magazine a pictorial history 
of the Color Line. 


In order to realize our plans we need 
10,000 subscribers—6,000 more than we 
have. Every reader of THe Crisis can 
by personal solicitation help us to this goal. 
Probably no magazine in America has a 
more interesting set of readers—we have 
on our books judges, financiers, philanthro- 
pists, college presidents and scholars, be- 
sides the best educated colored .people of 
the country. 


This magazine has as yet paid no salaries 
to its workers. Outside of this its income 
has more than paid its expenses each month 
Our books are open to those interested 
What we need now is capital. Anyone in- 
terested in investing money in this enter- 
prise, either as a pure matter of business 
or as a philanthropy, can get hold of some 
interesting facts by addressing the manager 
at 20 Vesey Street, New York City. 


Do not hesitate to criticize us. We want 
ideas. We want short, live articles, with 
facts done into English. We are not anx- 
ious for opinion and we write poetry our- 
selves. 

If you do not gct your copy, write us. If 
you do, and like it. write us. If you do not 
like it, do not fail to write us. 

Have you got any interesting pictures 
“along the Color Line?” Send them to us 

In tact, help us to help you and yours.

CHARLES SUMNER AND OTHERS. 


Charles Sumner was born January 6, 
1811. The centenary of his birthday was 
fittingly commemorated in New York, Bos- 
ton and Washington. 

In New York the anniversary was cele- 
brated with memorial exercises under the 
auspices of the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People, at 
the meeting house of the Society for 
Ethical Culture, Central Park West and 
Sixty-fourth Street. Dr. John Lovejoy 
Elliott presided, and the speakers were 
Mrs. Fanny Garrison Villard, the only 
daughter of William Lloyd Garrison; 
Moorfield Storey, the Boston lawyer, who 
is president of the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People, on 
“Charles Sumner;” Dr. W. E. Burghardt 
DuBois, on “Charles Sumner and Peace,” 
and the Rev. Dr. Stephen S. Wise, rabbi 
of the Free Synagogue, on “A Senator with 
a Conscience.” 

A telegram was read from Jacob S. Schiff, 
lauding Sumner as standing for the highest 
moral issues of his time. This was fol- 
lowed by the reading of a poem on Sumner 
composed by W. P. Stafford. 

Mr. Moorfield Storey said, among other 
things : 

“The man who appeals to race preju- 
dice, whether to keep his fellow-citizens 
down or to excite suspicion and enmity 
against a foreign nation, is a public enemy, 
and should be branded as such. His acts 
are far more dangerous to the State than 
those of the recognized criminal. If we 
would honor Sumner we must take up the 
battle to which he gave his life. We must 
wage unrelenting war against the absurd 
prejudices of race and color, whether they 
bar the Negro from his rights as a man; 
the foreigner from his welcome to our 
shores; the Filipino from his birthright of 
independence, the Hebrew from social rec- 
ognition, or breed the unjust and wicked 
suspicion which would embroil us in war 
with any other people, whether of Europe 
or Asia. Such meetings as this are of no 
avail if they do not inspire us with a de- 
termination to obey the precepts and fol- 
low the example of the man whom we 
would commemorate.” 

In Boston two meetings were held: the 
main meeting in Faneuil Hall and a branch 
meeting at Park Street Church. Ex-Gov- 
ernor Guild, Governor Foss, Rev. R. C. 
Ransom and others spoke. 

In Washington, D. C., several hundred 
prominent colored people attended the exer- 
cises under the auspices of the American 


Along the Color Line 





Negro Academy in the Fifteenth Street 
Presbyterian Church. A number of white 
persons were in the audience, and addresses 
were made by Justice Wendell Phillips 
Stafford and ex-Senator William E. 
Chandler, of New Hampshire. 


Memorial exercises to Julia Ward Howe 
were held in Symphony Hall, under the 
auspices of the city of Boston, and were 
largely attended, every available seat being 
taken, and hundreds being turned away. 

Mrs. Howe’s public services were the 
subject of addresses from four different 
standpoints. William H. Lewis, assistant 
U. S. Attorney, spoke of her devotion to 
the cause of the colored race. 


Emancipation Day was widely celebrated 
throughout the South on its forty-eighth 
anniversary, January 1. 


Colored people of the District of Colum- 
bia are making preparation for a jubilee 
and celebration of the fiftieth anniversary 
of the emancipation of slaves in the United 
a The celebration is to be held in 
1913, 


On February 3 occurs the centenary of 
Horace Greeley’s birth. 


POLITICAL. 


The Negro probiem has appeared in Con- 
gress in the question of expelling Senator 
Lorimer, and that of adopting a resolution 
favoring the popular election of Senators. 
The Judiciary Committee of the Senate re- 
ported the latter resolution with a proviso 
that the United States Government should 
not control elections. Many Senators op- 
pose this, and Senator Carter of Montana 
said: 

“The adoption of the amendment would 
give substantial, though limited, national 
sanction to the disfranchisement of N:- 
groes in the Southern States. 

“In their ‘disfranchisement,” went on 
Mr. Carter, “we now passively acquiesce, 
but with this supine attitude some Senators 
are not content; they ask us actually to 
strip Congress of the power to question 
election methods and actions in so far as 
the election of United States Senators may 
be concerned, and by the way of induce- 
ment to the Congress and the nation to con- 
sent to the permanent suppression of more 
than 1,000,000 votes at elections to choose 
Senators they will co-operate in the adop- 
tion of a constitutional amendment provid- 
ing for the election of United States Sena- 
tors by a direct vote of the people.”

The Hon. Harry W. Bass was sworn inas 
the first colored member of the Pennsylva- 
nia Legislature. He was welcomed by the 
Speaker, United States Senator Penrose 
and others. His was covered with 
flowers.

In Houston and San Antonio, Tex., the 
Negro vote is wanted for ship canal bonds 
and a new commission government A 
Negro paper, however, points out that 
Houston has a park paid for by public 
taxes which Negroes may not enter. The 
Danville (Va.) Register says as to the 
prohibition issue: 

“It is true that in a Democratic primary 
no Negro can vote. But it is also true that 
if the officers of registration and election 
will do their duty honestly, few Negroes 
will be able to register, and the majority 
of these will, we believe, favor prohibition.” 





Governor Blease of South Carolina said 
in his inaugural address 

“T am in favor of building up the: free- 
school system so that every white child in 
Seuth Carolina may be given a good com- 


mon school education 
“T am absolutely opposed to cempul 
sory education, and have little patience 


with, and much contempt for, that man 
or those men who go around in the 


State or outside of the State and parade 
figures to show the percentage of the ig- 
norance of our people. The white people 
of the South are the best friends to the 
Negro race. In my opinion, when the peo- 
ple of this country began to try to educate 
the Negro they made a serious and grave 
mistake, and I fear the worst result is 
yet to come. So why continue? I took 
this same position in my first political race 
twenty years ago, and each year has proved 
more clearly that I was right then, and 
the future will emphasize that I am right 
now. I believe that you members of the 
Legislature can pass an act which will 
meet all the requirements of both the Fed 
eral and State constitutions, which 
remedy this.”

THE COURTS 

The record of the Negro in the courts 
this month is unusually encouraging. 

The Alabama “Peonage” law has been 
held unconstitutional. The question of the 
constitutionality of the law was raised in 
the case of Alonzo Bailey, a Negro laborer 
of the Riverside Company. The law made 
it a misdemeanor for any person to enter 
into a contract to labor, receive advance 
pay and then fail to do the work without 
refunding the money advanced. The breach 
of the contract was made proof, on the 
face of things, of intent to defraud, and 
under a rule of Alabama law the laborer 
was not permitted to rebut this proof by 
testifying as to his unexpressed intention 
at the time of making the contract. 

Justice Hughes read the decision and 
said that a State could not reduce a person 
to involuntary service by the indirect 
method of making his failure to pay a‘debt 
a crime. 


Southern railroads have not complied 
with the direction of the Interstate Com 
merce Commission as to equal accommo 
dations for Negro travelers. The railroads 
demurred in a Tennessee court, but Judge 
Sanford overruled them, and the Commis 
sion will probably either enforce its de- 
mands or abolish the “Jim Crow” system. 

Governor Wilson of Kentucky has par 
doned eleven Negroes who are in the Ken- 
tucky Penitentiary for defending them 
selves in a race riot. Governor Wilson 
said: “It is a sorrow to every man who 
honors and loves Kentucky that such a 
story as this could be true in any county 
in Kentucky.” 





That railroads cannot be required to 
provide separate compartments in sleeping 
cars for white and Negro passengers was 
the decision of the Court of Appeals re 
cently in the case of the Commonwealth of 


Kentucky against the Illinois Central Rail- 
road. 
The- court held that inasmuch as the 


sleeping cars are not owned and controlled

by the railroads that the railroads cannot

tion. 





When a Negro makes a contract to buy 
a house in a first-class residence district 
without concealing his color, the seller can- 
not declare the contract invalid merely 
because the purchaser is a Negro, 

Thus the State Supreme Court ruled 
recently in the case of David Cole, a Negro, 
against a real estate company of Seattle, 
which contended that selling a lot to Cole 
would depreciate the value of its other 
property in the neighborhood. 


ECONOMIC. 
Negro settlements with considerable land 
holdings are being projected in California 
and Nevada by local colored capitalists. 





The two colored banks of Nashville, 
Tenn., are in good condition, but the Nickel 
Savings Bank of Richmond, Va., has failed. 
It had a capital of $10,000. An application 
for a bank charter has been filed in Wico- 
mico county, Md. 


A building and loan association has been 
started in Scranton, Pa. 





Mississippi planters in the Black Belt are 
warning labor agents not to entice their 
colored laborers away to Arkansas. 

The Pullman Company pays its colored 
porters $15 and $20 a month, occasionally 
$25. For the larger part of their income 
these porters depend on tins, 

The increased cost of living and the dis- 
position of the public to stop tipping have 
led the porters to petition for higher wages. 

Four million dollars is the amount of 
money that the Negroes of Philadelphia 
have on deposit in the various savings in- 
stitutions in that city, according to ad- 
dresses made the other evening by leading 
Negro business and professional men at a 
banquet given by the board of directors of 
the People’s Savings Bank of Philadelphia, 
which is the only Negro bank north of the 
Mason and Dixon line. 


Julius Rosenwald, a prominent Chicago 
Jew, has offered to give $25,000 to every city 
that shall raise $75,000 for a colored Young 
Men’s Christian Association building. M. 
W. Harris, a banker, has contributed $25,- 
000 to the colored building for Chicag 
President Taft has written a commendatory 
letter. After a ten days’ campaign the col- 
ored people raised $66,000 in Chicago, so 
that the building there is assured. It will 
be between 24th and 39th Streets and will 
contain a gymnasium, swimming pool, 
shower baths, bowling alleys, billiard room, 
restaurant, dormitories, reading room agd 
library, night school, lecture rooms and 
clubrooms for boys

The International Committee of the Y. 
M. C. A. has been promised a salary for 
two field secretaries in addition to the three 
men now on the force to assist in the ex- 
tension of the Colored Y. M. C. A. move- 
ment. 


The Episcopal community of colored Sis- 
ters has been moved from Baltimore to 
KXansas City. 

The Right Rey. Silveria Gomez Pimen 
tar, who died a few years ago in South 
America, was the first Catholic Negro 
bishop in the New World. His parents 
were slaves, but he became auxiliary bishop 
ot Balua at an early age, and in 1902 was 
made Bishop of Marianna by Pope Leo 
XIII. There were 2,000,000 people in his 
diocese. He succeeded in restoring and 
elevating the religious and social life of 
his district, and was a man of vast learn- 
ing, with high reputation as an Orientalist. 





Pope Pius X. is manifesting great inter- 
est in mission work among colored people 
in the United States. Rev. J. E. Burk, the 
director-general of this work, is undertak 
ing to raise $50,000 a year for it. 

The colored Methodists of Baltimore 
have finally taken possession of the former 
home of St. Peter’s Protestant Episcopal 
Church. Fifty thousand colored people live 
within a radius of eight blocks of this 
church, and there are twelve colored 
churches in the neighborhood. This is the 
largest church owned by Negroes in the 
United States. The congregation was 
founded by Daniel Coker. 





EDUCATION. 

In Shreveport, La., the principal of the 
colored school says in an appeal for funds: 

“There are, in round numbers, 3,000 
educable colored school children in Shreve 
port. About 1,000 are in school, 350 have 
applied for admission, but because of a 
lack of room and teachers they have been 
turned away with tearful eyes. Others 
knowing that there is no room have not 
applied. Two thousand children cannot get 
into our schools.” 


In Florence, S. C., the 105 white teachers 
receive $36,804 a year in salaries for teach- 
ing 59 schools; while the 56 Negro teachers 
get $7,359 for teaching 49 schools. 


Founders’ Day at Hampton Institute was 
largely devoted to a discussion of Negro 
industrial education by Northern and 
Southern white men. 

The State Board of Education has voted 
to place the new colored normal school at 
Nashville, Tenn., provided $80,000 is raised. 

Fire has destroyed the girl’s dormitory of 
the colored school at Conroe, Tex., and 
nearly the whole plant of the Methodist

school at Homer, La. The latter was the 
largest colored school in the section. 


Howard University has dedicated a new 
$90,000 science hall. 


The State of North Carolina has agreed 
to give the Slater Industrial School for 
Negroes in the little town of Winston- 
Salem in that State, the sum of $12,000, if 
the colored people will raise a similar 
amount. 


Eleven thousand dollars for Negro edu- 
cation, to be applied to the work of the 
Mississippi Industrial College at Holly 
Springs, Miss. is the record-breaking 
achievement of the Negroes of Mississip>i 
Conference of the Colored Methodist Epis- 
copal Church. 


The new colored industrial school in 
Charleston, S. C., will open next month, 


At Richmond, Ind., Lorella Burden, a 
colored girl, about twelve years of age, 
has been declared the champion speller in 
the township. It seemed impossible to give 
the girl a word which she could not spell, 
and she is expected to win the county 
match in January and to be a representative 
of the district match in February. 


At Hammond, La., the colored citizens 
held a mass meeting and an organization 
was perfected for the purpose of carrying

“It will be seen that the desertion rate

with the very low rate of the British army, 
and that both of these rates are very much 
lower than the desertion rate of our white 
troops. Inasmuch as our colored soldiers 
are treated in every way precisely the same 
as our white soldiers, it is evident that 
this treatment is not the cause of deser-

ment makes me most hopeful of his ultimate 
triumph over present obstacles, I should 
answer unhesitatingly it is the magnificent

War as commissary sergeant in a regiment 
of volunteers on the Union side. After the 
close of the war he was graduated from 
Atlanta University. He then studied at 
Wilberforce, and at Harvard. He was the 
author of “The Negro in Sacred History,” 
“The Black Man in Natural History,” and 
other works. He recently organized a soap 
company in Brooklyn, so as to raise money 
to publish his life work entitled, “The 
Blood.” He is survived by a widow and 
three sons. Dr. Haynes was a member of

VAGARIES OF THE COLOR LINE 


New Orleans is in a pretty pother. A 
new superintendent of schools from Mis- 
souri invited colored teachers to meet with 
white teachers and listen to a lecture on 
penmanship. 

“The New Orleans Federation of 
Women’s Clubs have called meetings to 
adopt resolutions attacking what they term 
a repudiation of Southern ideals and the 
trampling under foot of tradition. 

“One teacher said that she was seated 
in the second row at the meeting yester- 
day, and that two Negro teachers sat di- 
rectly behind her, and several more sat 
behind these. In fact, she said, the Negro: 
teachers, numbering about thirty, were 
spread all over one side of the room. 
the white teachers were highly indignant 
at being forced to submit to such treat- 
ment.” 

Attention is called to the fact that this 
policy is almost unprecedented. A _ local 
paper says: 

“Some years ago the attention of the 
presidents of the Public School Co-opera- 
tive Clubs was called to the fact that 
white teachers and Negro teachers were 
paid at the same time at the City Hall. 
As this was not considered necessary, and 
it was not desired by the white or the 
Negro teachers, the attention of the school 
officials at that time was called to it, and 
the promise was made that it should never 
be repeated, and it was not. The Negro 
teachers in the schools come from the best 
element of their race, and it is probable 
that not one of them desired to be placed in 
the position they were put yesterday by the 
new superintendent.” 

The school officials apologize and say: 

“The white and the Negro teachers are 
placed on an entirely different footing with 
the School Board. Their pay is not 
graded in the same way, and they have 
been kept as separate from each other as 
it was possible for them to be.” 








10 THE CRISIS 


The 


in a 


Times-Democrat sums up th 
serious editorial utterance 
“When, a short time ago, the prize pupils 
of our public schools went to the Cléveland 
‘spelling bee,’ and it was discovered that 
the competition was between white and Ne 
gro pupils, Mr, Easton was bitterly de- 
nounced for his action in taking the New 
Orleans white children into this contest 
with Negroes. He accepted the responsi- 
bility, explaining that there was no time 
for thought, made public apology for his 
mistake, and promised that no mixture of 
races should ever again occur in any school 


function, lecture or any ceremony.” 
on *~ * ~ 


matter 


“Prof. Gwinn’s defense seems to be that, 
being a stranger, knowing little of New 
Orleans sentiment, he was ignorant of how 
grossly he had violated our ideals and our 
practices. ‘I paid no special attention to 
the matter,’ he says in his excuses, whereas 
any Southerner would: have paid special at- 
tention at once to a gathering of whites 
and Negroes, and would have seen the mis- 
take that had been made.” 


Two cases of intermarriage have aroused 
the South: in Chattanooga Miss Grace Doty 
ran away to Cincinnati and married an 
octoroon. In Baltimore a couple were ar- 
rested and put in jail for getting married 
because the groom is suspected of Negro 
blood. The Maryland law reads: 

“It is a felony for a white person and a 
Negro, or a white person and a person of 
Negro descent to the third generation, to 
marry.’ The penalty is imprisonment for 
18 months to 10 years in the penitentiary. 

The presence of a little girl with one- 
thirtieth of Negro blood in a Maryland 
school has disrupted it and the case is under 
serious consideration. 


Adverse action is recommended by the 
commissioners on House bill 30568, which 
provides for “jim crow” cars in the Dis- 
trict of Columbia. The bill was introduced 
by Representative Clark, of Florida, several 
weeks ago. 

The bill was sent to the commissioners 
by Chairman Smith, of the House District 
committee, for an opinion. After carefully 
considering the matter the commissioners, 
in a letter to Mr, Smith sent to the Capitol 
yesterday, said: 

“The commissioners know of no local 
demand or sentiment in the District of Co- 
himbia for any legislation of this character, 
and do not believe that any such legislation 
is desirable. They recommend adverse 
action on the bill.” 

The Rev. W. W. 
most prominent 
South, says 

“T don’t doubt that in the course of time 
—500 years, 1,000 years—the Negro may be 
absorbed. I believe in time 
in America will be a composite one

white clergymen of the

can, Asiatic, European, all combined, But 
what may be expected in a future so dis- 
tant does not affect the problem we have 
to deal with to-day.” 

About thirty-five medical students from 
Georgetown and George Washington Uni 
versities went on strike recently against 
the lectures given by Dr. William White, 
superintendent of the Government Hospital 
for the Insane at Washington, D. C., be- 
cause of the presence at the last lecture 
of about thirty Negro medical students 
from Howard University. Dr. White re- 
fuses to give a separate course of lectures 
for whites. 





Guy Fitzgerald, a Virginian, enrolled in 
the college of agriculture of the Univer- 
sity of Minnesota, is conducting a losing 
fight against allowing Negro students to be- 
long to the Agricultural Society, a college 
organization. Fitzgerald refused to pose 
in the society’s group picture along with 
the Negroes whom the president would not 
bar out. Then he introduced a resolution 
permitting only white students to become 
members of the society. This was de- 
feated. 





ART. 

William Stanley Braithwaite attended the 
dinner of the Poetry Society of New York. 

William E. Scott, the colored artist, has 
several pictures in the exhibition of the 
Society of Western Artists. 

Henry O. Tanner has two paintings in 
the special exhibit department of the Cor- 
coran Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C. 
One is “The Three Marys” and the other 
“The Return of the Holy Womer.” 


George W. Walker, the well-known co- 
median, is dead. 


CRIME. 

Negro farm Jdaborers are being driven 
out of Turner County, Ga., and all Negroes 
have been warned to leave the town of 
Butler, Okla. ———— 

Three Negroes were lynched in Shelby 
county, Ky. One was accused of throwing 
kisses at white girls. 


The colored man who was arrested in 
New York on the charge of killing ser- 
vants in the home of Dr. Cannon, 123d 
Street, has been finally released. 

In the Ohio lynching, the only lynching 
that occurred in the North during 1910, one 
of the mob leaders has been sentenced to 
twenty years in the penitentiary, and this 
one man is a black nran. If no other of 
the Ohio lynchers are punished it will ap- 
pear that Ohio picked the black man for 
the scapegoat, and that suggests what is 
probably true, that the North, if it had the 
blacks to deal with on as large a scale as 
in the South, would give them the worst 
of it in the administration of the law.—

OPINION 


PEONAGE. 


The decision of the Supreme Court 
against Alabama peonage has attracted 
little attention in the press. A brief dis- 
patch from Washington announced the 
court’s view, and few papers gave it promi 
nence. The New York Evening Post thinks 
there will be general rejoicing, North and 
South, at the result of the decision. The 
peonage law, it says, was a long step toward 
re-enslaving the Negro. 

“Unlike the open attempts at enslavement 
in peonage camps which were so vigorously 
opposed in the Roosevelt Administration, 
this was a legal attempt to meet the diff 
culties caused by the instability of Negro 
labor. On its face it made.it a misde- 
meanor to take advance pay for labor 
and to fail to work out the advanced money. 
Practically by the aid ot chain-gang sen- 
tences, it meant that if a workingman 
bound himself to serve, but found the con- 
ditions of labor were insupportable, he could 
be reduced to involuntary servitude by the 
indirect method of making his failure to 
pay a debt a crime. 

“The Supreme Court’s decision will be 
heartily welcomed by broad-minded South- 
erners everywhere; for they realize that, 
vexing as the labor problem is, the solution 
lies in other directions than involuntary 
servitude. 

“This Alabama decision means, of course, 
far more than appears on the surface. It 
will not only check further legislation in 
that direction, but will probably result in 
upsetting similar statutes elsewhere. More 
than that, it wil put heart into the colored 
people whose fears have been aroused by 
the President's Southern appointments to 
the Supreme Court. It will be a gratify- 
ing proof to them that, after all, there 
are courts in the land; and they need this 
assurance now that the attacks upon them 
have taken the form not only of assaults 
upon their freedom, but -upon their right 
to hold property. This is the meaning of 
the Baltimore segregation plan; there is 
segregation of the Negroes there now as in 
every large city, but it is voluntary. 

“A decision has just come from the State 
of Washington’s Supreme Court which will 
give comfort to the Baltimore colored peo- 
ple. There it has been held that a real 
estate company cannot decline to transfer 
a lot to a colored man if he has contracted 
to purchase it openly and fairly. These de- 
cisions merely uphold the fundamental 
principles of democracy.” 

The Chicago Record-Herald takes the 
same view. It says the decision will be 
welcomed .by humane people everywhere, 


and will put new heart into the colored 
people. “This confidence will be strength 
ened by the action of the President in the 
case of the lumber and turpentine operator 
in Florida. It is not only likely that bad 
labor legislation in the South will be 
checked, but it becomes less likely that of- 
fenders against the plain laws of humanity 
shall escape unpunished.” 

PEACE. 

The Rev. Samuel H. Bishop, who is Sec- 
retary of the American Church Institute, 
organized by the Episcopal Church, wrote 
to the New York Evening Post a letter 
apropos of Mr. Carnegie’s gift of $10,000,- 
000 to the cause of peace. Mr. Bishop is 
glad that the crusade should be furthered, 
but he feels that the sentiment against war 
is growing stronger and would soon con- 
quer without Mr. Carnegie’s millions, while 
there seems to him a greater cause that 
might have been advanced by such a gift. 

“Superlatives,” he says, “are dangerous, 
but if there is any superlative of importance 
which is safe, I am confident it is the super- 
lative of the Negro problem. Consider 
what it means—that a social group, nearly 
12,000,000 strong, with a strong racial dif- 
ferentiation which has thus far prevented 
that group’s thorough assimilation into 
American life, has 2,500,000 children and 
youth under twenty, of whom not more than 
45 per cent. have any opportunity for 
training in the art and knowledge of life, 
and in the responsibilities and duties of 
citizenship. 

“Consider also that in our Northern cities 
the workers of that group suffer from a 
wage discrimination of about 20 per cent.; 
from a rent discrimination of about 20 per 
cent.; consider such a suggestion as that 
recently made by the Governor of South 
Carolina, which every student of the Negro 
problem knows is the expression of a 
tendency which has been with great difficulty 
prevented from being expressed in law; 
consider the action of the Baltimore Board 
of Aldermen. I am not intimating at all 
that there is any probability of an insur- 
rection—that is not my point—but the point 
is clear that no propaganda for peace can 
afford to ignore a situation which is per se 
productive of the war spirit. 

“The Episcopal Church has undertaken 
to establish a great Negro university called 
the American Church Institute for Negroes. 
It has in five States of the Union six 
schools, with two more applying for rela- 
tionship to it; 1,600 students, 80 instructors 
and teachers, more than twenty departments 
of industrial and professional education. 








12 THE CRISIS 


Will not some wise Episcopalian, or any 
wise citizen, see here an opportunity for 
going deeper even than Mr. Carnegie or 
Mr. Rockefeller has yet done?” 


NEGRO MUSIC. 


An ancient controversy that involves the 
Negro as a musician has been renewed in 
the New York Sun, the Boston Transcript 
and the Springfield Republican. When 
Dvorak wrote his “American Symphony,” 
did he or did he not in certain parts copy 
the music of the American Negro? This 
is the question. It is not denied that he 
was influenced by Negro melodies, but how 
far? 

Mr. Philip Hale, of the Boston Tran- 
script, wrote to the sons of Dvorak to 
ask them to settle the question. The sons 
replied: 

“In America Negro airs, which abound 
in melodic particularities, interested our 
father. He studied them and arranged the 
scale according to which they are formed. 
But the passages of the symphony and of 
other works of this American period, which 
as some pretend have been taken from 
Negro airs, are absolutely our father’s own 
mentai property; they were only influenced 
by Negro melodies. 

“As in his Slav pieces he never used Slav 
songs, but being a Slav created what his 
heart dictated, all the works of this Ameri- 
can period, the symphony included, respond 
to Slav origin and anyone who has the least 
feeling will proclaim this fact. Who will 
not recognize the homesickness in the largo 
of this symphony? The secondary: phrase 
of the first movement, the first theme of 
the scherzo, the beginning of the finale and 
perhaps also the melody of the largo which 
give a certain impression of the groaning 
Negro song, are only influenced by this 
song and determined by change of land 
and the influence of a foreign climate.” 

Another investigation led to the conclu- 
ar in the mind of the Boston critic, that 
the 


Negro airs influenced and “only 
slightly” but two or three passages. 
“Yet,” adds Mr. Hale, with sarcasm, 


“some will undoubtedly continue to insist 
that the symphony ‘From the New World’ 
is based for the most part on Negro 
themes.” 

Mr. W. J. Henderson, of the Sun, thinks 
that Mr. Hale has proved the case of his 
adversaries and that Dvorak was very much 
influenced by “the idiom of our Negro 
music, which he thought was the only char- 
acteristic musical thing in the United 
States,” and that he said as much plainly 
to New York critics. It is settled in Mr. 
Henderson’s mind, but he thinks the other 
side so unreasonable that they will probably 
“continue to insist that Dr. Dvorak never 
made any study of Negro themes, that he 
never asserted that upon them might be 
reared a distinctly American type of music, 
that he made no endeavor to do any- 
thing of the kind, that he never told any 


New York critic that he did, and that all 
New York critics are habitual evaders of 
the truth.” 


COLORED PREACHERS. 


Some discussion has arisen over the 
standing of the Negro as a preacher. The 
Literary Digest quotes several opinions of 
this subject. The discussion began with 
an article in the Southwestern Christian 
Advocate (colored), written by the Rev. 
Robert E. Jones, who asserted that the 
race had produced no preacher of real 
eminence. In other walks there have been 
colored men of much distinction, but in the 
pulpit, he claimed, they have not shone, in 
spite of their religious temperament. 

“In spite of the fact that there are ap- 
proximately 10,000 Negroes who are min- 
isters of the Gospel,” he says, “we have 
no man among us who has made outstanding 
and unquestioned success as a preacher. In 
making this statement we are not unmind- 
ful of the fact that here and there are 
preachers who have local reputations and 
who are somewhat known in the nation, 
but there is no towering, masterful, per- 
suasive preacher of the Gospel. There is 
certainly no man among us who is to the 
nation what Talmage or Moody or Beecher 
was. Nor is there any man among us who 
is the undisputed Talmage or Moody or 
Beecher of the race. 

“True enough, we have the spiritual tem- 
perament. Our preachers are particularly 
apt in giving the Gospel narrative and ex- 
pounding the truth. There are men of 
piety, and, in some instances, there are men 
of scholarly attainments, but the preacher 
has not yet arrived. We are not attempt- 
ing to assign a reason for this, we are sim- 
ply stating a fact.” 

Mr. John Edward Bruce writes to the 
New York Sun, joining in the discussion 
and taking the opposite view. He gives a 
list of distinguished Negro preachers: 

“The Rev. John C. Penington, born a 
slave, was a great preacher and highly 
esteemed by all who knew him. He was a 
member of the Hartford Central Associa- 
tion of Congregational Ministers, which 
consisted of about twenty of the leading 
ministers of that denomination in Connec- 
ticut. He was twice elected its president, 
in which capacity, as the record will show, 
he presided over assemblies composed en- 
tirely of whites. 

“At one of these meetings two young men 
from Kentucky presented themselves for 
licenses to preach. The rules required that 
the president examine the candidates on 
experimental religion, church history and 
theology. This Dr. Penington did accept- 
ably, and the white candidates were both 
licensed and their certificates signed by the 
black president. In 1841 he published a 
book, ‘The History and Origin of the Col- 
ored Race.’ Penington was born in Mary- 
land in 1809. He was elected by the State 
of Connecticut in 1843 as a delegate to the

world’s anti-slavery convention and to rep- 
resent it in the world’s peace convention 
held the same. year in London. He ad- 
dressed the anti-slavery convention at con- 
siderable length. Dr. Penington was much 
in demand as a speaker during his stay in 
England and preached in many of the 
prominent churches. 

“Henry Highland Garnet, of New York, 
is another Negro clergyman who may be 
said to have been pre-eminent as a preacher. 
He was the first Negro Chaplain of the 
National House of Representatives by spe- 
cial invitation. President Arthur made 
him United States Minister to Liberia in 
1881. He died there after a residence of 
about one year, honored and respected by 
his race on both sides of the Atlantic. 

“Dr. Alexander Crummell, late pastor 
of St. Luke’s Protestant Episcopal Church, 
Washington, was graduated from Oxford 
University in England. He was president 
of Liberia College for some time, and was 
a preacher of great force and power. His 
books, ‘The Greatness of Christ’ and ‘Af- 
rica and America’ are masterpieces of good 
English. The Rev. J. B. Reeve, of Phila- 
delphia, is one of the ablest and most schol- 
arly Negro clergymen of the present day. 
He is a fine Greek and Hebrew scholar 
and an eloquent and instructive preacher. 

a Rev. John Chavis, of Wake county, 

C., had the remarkable distinction of 
hae not only a great preacher, who 
preached to white congregations only, up 
to 1833, throughout Wake county, N. C., 
but was the first Negro to open a classical 
school in the South for white youths. He 
was proficient in Greek, Hebrew and 
French. The accomplishments of such men 
as I have mentioned entitle them, I think, 
to be called pre-eminent.” 


A LATTER-DAY DRED SCOTT. 


The Providence Journal thinks that Pink 
Franklin’s case, with which the readers of 
Tue Crisis are familiar, may not become 
as famous as that of Dred Scott, but that 
he has certainly been an object of solici- 
tude to courts, statesmen and people over 
a wide area. 

“So far as Pink himself is concerned,” 
remarks the Journal, “interest in his cele- 
brated case is probably satisfied by his es- 
cape from the gallows. The offence for 
which his arrest was attempted was a viola- 
tion of an agricultural contract statute, 
of a nature which, in an Alabama case, 
the Supreme Court of the United States 
has since decided to be unconstitutional. 
The Supreme Court of South Carolina had 
already declared this statute unconstitu- 
tional. 

“The Supreme Court of the United 
States, appealed to for relief, failed to be 
convinced that the verdict essentially dis- 
regarded the unconstitutionality of the stat- 
ute. The record afforded no sufficient 
ground for doubting that what the jury 
considered was whether Pink Franklin was 


warranted in resisting arrest with deadly 
vigor. Technicalities aside, the fact re- 
mained apparent that the Negro was ini- 
tially the victim of an illegal procedure. 
The warrant should never have been issued. 

“At the thrilling juncture where Pink 
Franklin found himself, with the court of 
last resort heard from, facing the gallows, 
the National Association for the Advance- 
ment of Colored People appealed to Presi- 
dent Taft, who appealed in turn to the 
Governor of South Carolina, who on the 
eve of his retirement has now commuted 
Pink Franklin’s sentence to life imprison- 
ment. 

“Peonage in the South has been respon- 
sible for so much mischief that, irrespec- 
tive of race or color, there ought to be gen- 
eral satisfaction at Pink Franklin’s escape 
from contributing with his life to the evil 
record.” 


WAS HANNIBAL A NEGRO? 


General Burt’s article on the Negro sol- 
dier, reprinted elsewhere in this magazine, 
aroused some discussion. Dr, G. Harrison 
wrote to the New York Evening Post 
saying that he had no criticism to make 
of the heroism of the colored soldiers, but 
he would would like to know on what 
authority Clitus, the Macedonian cavalry 
commander, and Hannibal and the Cartha- 
ginians are classed as Negroes. 

“I do not think,” adds Dr. Harrison, 
“that the Abyssinians are considered Ne- 
groes. I would like to know what authority 
the author has for the number of Negro 
soldiers he states served in the Revolu- 
tionary War.” 

General Burt replied as follows: 

“In the New York Herald was published 
during the St. Louis Exposition extracts 
from the diary of Baron von Clausen, a 
German army officer, who came to the 
country during the Revolutionary War and 
visited General Washington’s camp at 
White Plains, N. Y. Among other inter- 
esting things which this diary contained 
was the statement that ‘of the 20,000 sol- 
diers in this camp one-fourth of them are 
Negroes, and the best-drilled and dis- 
cipiined regiment here is one from Rhode 
Island, three-fourths of which are com- 
posed of Negroes.’ Again, in G. W. Wil- 
liams’ admirable history of the Negro sol- 
dier Dr. Harrison will find much valuable 
data regarding the military services of the 
black man in our war for independence. 

“Dr, Harrison asks for my authority for 
stating that Clitus (Alexander the Great’s 
foster brother—Enc. Britannica) was a 
Negro. The proofs concerning the ethnic 
origin of Clitus were obtained from Mr. 
Daniel Murray, who for about thirty years 
has been an assistant to the Librarian of 
Congress, and has collected more than 
25,000 biographies of people of African ori- 
gin, which is soon to be published. Among 
these biographical sketches is that of Clitus, 
Alexander’s great cavalry leader, the Phil 
Sheridan of his time. 








14 THE CRISIS 


“The doctor, in his letter, says 
think the Abyssinians are considered Ne 
groes.. That the Abyssinians are of 
Negroid peoples there can be no doubt 
They have all the outward physical charac 
teristics of people, and Menelik, the 
Negus, had documentary evidence showing 
his undoubted lineal descent from the Queen 
of Sheba, who 


‘I do not 


the 


was an Ethiopian woman 
‘black and comely,’ as Solomon described 
her. 

“IT have not the time to go into any 
extended discussion relative to the ethni 
origin of the Carthaginians. One thing 
about which there can be no doubt con 
cerning this redoubtable race is that they 
arose in Africa. The city of Carthage 
was built on the north coast of the Afri- 
can continent facing the Mediterranean 
Sea, and the relics of its arts which showed 


the destruction of the city showed distinct- 
ive characteristics which 


were neither 
Greek, Egyptian nor Roman. Some his- 
torians have declared them to be of Phe- 


nician origin, but the better opinion now is 
that the Carthaginians and Numidians who 
moved to the coast, and, touching the ‘sea 
of civilization, developed with that amaz- 
ing rapidity characteristic of all Negroid 
people wherever they have the opportunity 
to learn and develop.” 

\ rather interesting point, it may be 
added, which has not been taken up is that 
there was a Russian Hannibal, a celebrated 
general and the grandfather of the poet 
Puskin, who was a full-blooded Negro.

PROPI 

The Epworth Herald, organ of the Ep- 
worth League of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, reiates the story of a colored man 
in Texas who went into a real estate deal- 
er’s office, paid ten thousand dollars for 
one piece of land, and before he left closed 
a bargain for another piece costing fifteen 
thousand. 

“There is nothing very remarkable about 
this, perhaps, from certain standpoints,” 
continues the Epworth Herald, “but when 
it is stated in this connection that thirty 
years ago this same Negro went to Kansas 
without a dollar in hand and began doing 
odd jobs about town, and that to-day he is 
worth at least fifty thousand doilars, the 
story is worth telling. It lays emphasis 
upon what the Negro can do with himself 
and for himself under certain circum- 
stances. Honesty, sobriety and a chance 
will make the Negro a man of whom the 
nation may well be proud. 

“It is for this very thing that the Meth- 
odist Episcopal Church has contended right 
along. Let the Negro have education 
through a good system of schools, let him 
be guided in the principles of the higher 
life by the Church, and then give him a 
chance. And the nation will 
the results.”

READING. 

Mr. J. E. Boyd, colored State Superin- 
tendent of the Baptist Young People’s 
Union Missions in Texas, makes a plea 
in the Houston Post for good literature for 
the colored population. At present he says 
that the colored young people have little 
or nothing to read except cheap and trashy 
books that must do them harm. He outlines 
a scheme for supplying the colored people 
with good books: 

“Missionary wagons should be placed in 
the various parts or districts of Texas and 
they should be supplied with good Christian 
and wholesome reading matter and placed 
in the hands of a good, competent and in- 
telligent missionary, and each should trav 
erse his respective district year in and year 
out, distributing same among our Negro 
homes, which are the foundations of our 
lives. 

“This is what our State Baptist Young 
People’s Union convention of Texas is en- 
deavoring to do, and right now we are 
making the struggle of our lives to put a 
Baptist Young People’s Union missionary 
wagon in each of the eighteen districts in

SOUTH AFRICA 
That South Africa is facing a serious 
problem in the question of how best to 
treat with its Asiatic and Negro popula- 
tion was asserted by Rudolphe Lemieux, 


Postmaster-General of Canada, who has 
arrived in the United States from England. 
Lemieux has returned from the inaugura- 
tion ceremonies of the United Common- 
wealth of South Africa, which he attended 
as the Canadian representative. 

“In Natal alone there are 125,000 Asiatics 
and only 100,000 whites,” he said, “and it 
will be necessary soon to decide what 
political and business attitude is to be 
mantained toward the imported laborers. 
Other States must come out flatly and an- 
nounce whether they will follow the ex- 
ample of Cape Colony and give the Asiatic 
and the Negro political status.” 


HW oo 
PINK FRANKLIN’S REPRIEVE 


Last summer it was brought to the at- 
tention of the Association that a petition 
for pardon, properly presented to the Gov- 
ernor of South Carolina, might be success- 
ful in saving the life of Pink Franklin. 
Thomas E. Miller, President of the State 
Colored College at Orangeburg, offered his 
services in connection with circulating the 
petition and seeing that it was properly pre- 
sented to Governor Ansel. After the Su- 
preme Court of the United States had 
declined to try the case, and Franklin was 
remanded to the penitentiary for resen- 
tence to death, his colored attorneys, Adams 
and Moorer, who had had charge of the 
case from the beginning, made an appeal 
for a new trial, on the ground of newly 
discovered evidence. The Association 
caused their brief to be submitted to two 
prominent New York lawyers—one of them 
an ex-Assistant District Attorney—and 
since, in the judgment of these lawyers 
the brief did not show sufficient grounds 
for the granting of a new trial, the Asso- 
ciation decided to bend its energies to hav- 
ing the case discontinued in the courts, and 
to the presentation of an appeal for mercy 
to the Governor. 

Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard, Acting 
Chairman of the Executive Committee, had 
the case brought to the attention of Presi- 
dent Taft, who, by the courtesy of ex- 
United States Attorney-General Charles J. 
Bonaparte was placed in possession of Mr. 
Bonaparte’s brief prepared for the Supreme 
Court of the United States. The President 
felt strongly that Franklin should not hang, 
and personally wrote to Governor Ansel, 
bespeaking his good offices when the peti- 
tion should be presented to him. Mr. 
Robert C. Ogden, whose interest the Asso- 
ciation also secured, wrote to the President 
of the University of South Carolina, who 
in turn wrote to Governor Ansel in Frank- 
lin’s behalf. 

It was found, owing to the political agi- 
tation which had resulted in connection with 
the case—the original warrant of arrest 
having been issued under the so-called “ag- 





ricultural contract” law which encourages 
peonage—that our success with the Gov- 
ernor would be doubtful if Franklin's origi- 
nal lawyers were retained to present the 
appeal for pardon. They were therefore 
prevailed upon to relinquish the case to 
this Association, and Claude E. Sawyer 
of Aiken, was employed. Benjamin F. 
Hagood, of the law firm of Mordecai, Gads- 
den & Hagood, of Charleston—the largest 
law firm in the State of South Carolina— 
also volunteered his services in pleading 
Franklin’s cause before the Governor. The 
State, of Columbia, S. C., has steadfastly 
supported Fre anklin, and published a number 
of editorials in his favor, as did also the 
News and Courier, of Charleston. Mr. 
Wannamaker, the editor of the latter paper, 
was one of the jurors at Franklin’s first 
trial, 

As soon as the relatives of Valentine, the 
murdered man, learned that the Associa- 
tion was moving for Franklin’s pardon, they 
circulated a petition to the Governor not to 
interfere with the execution; but a reprieve 
was first granted until January 3lst, and 
on January 6th the Governor finally com- 
muted the sentence of death to life im- 
prisonment. The Association will not cease 
its efforts, however, to secure Franklin’s 
release from prison. 

The Association has received the follow 
ing letter among others: 

“IT have just received your letter of the 
6th inst. and am very much gratified to 
learn that Pink Franklin’s sentence has been 
commuted, I agree with you in thinking 
that the penalty of life imprisonment is 
entirely too severe for his offence, and 
that it would have accorded with justice 
for him to be freely pardoned; neverthe- 
less, since his life is saved, there is an 
opportunity to secure later a further meas- 
ure of clemency for him. I think your 
Association has every reason to be gratified 
at the result of its efforts in this case; and 
I remain, as ever, 

“Yours most truly, 
(Signed) “CHariEs J. BoNAPARTE.”

EDUCATION. 


HE amount of positive igno- 

I rance on the situation of the 

colored people in America is 
simply appalling. Take, for instance, 
the matter of the education of chil- 
dren. The Lawrence (Mass.) Amer- 
ican says with great complacence: 

“The education of the Negro in the 
South is now on a sound and safe 
basis. Its scope is broad and sensible, 
training him both mentally and indus- 
trially, not forgetting his moral eleva- 
tion as well. It is a task being well 
done, and the results should be effect- 
ive in wearing down the edge of the 
racial prejudice below the Mason and 
Dixon line.” 

A leading colored paper, the In- 
dianapolis Freeman, also asserts that 
there is no effort “to deny Negroes 
education in America. It will be ad- 
mitted that there are now and then 
inconveniences, perhaps owing to 
prejudice in localities, but not to such 
an extent as to deprive the Negro 
child of some education, if so de- 
sired.” 

These writers believe what they say. 
They believe it because they want to 
believe it, however, and not because 
they have made any effort to get at 
the facts. Yet the facts are perfectly 
plain. The last published report of 
the United States Commissioner of 
Education, 1909, gives these figures: 


Colored children, 5-18 years 


eR ere 3,964,398 
Number of these daily at- 

tending schools ......... 1,035,747 
oe 33.7% 
Average length of school 


term for colored and white 
children in the South, per 
OT cc04s scans saan ee ee 24 weeks 


This means that only one-third the 
Negro children 5-18 years of age are 
attending school and it is fair to as- 
sume that less than half of those 5-14 


years of age are in school. More- 
over, the Negro schools being shorter 
than the white schools do not average 
as much as five months a year. 

These are the official figures com- 
piled for public consumption by white 
Southern officials. The State super- 
visor of rural schools of South Caro- 
lina says openly in his last report: 
“It has been my observation that the 
Negro schools of South Carolina are 
for the most part without supervision 
of any kind. Frequently the county 
superintendent does not know where 
they are located, and sometimes the 
district board cannot tell where the 
school is taught!” 

If once we go behind the official ad- 
missions the picture is even worse. 
As we pointed out in the January 
Crisis, in one Alabama county out of 
10,758 Negro children only 1,000 were 
in school. As to Louisiana, this is the 
way V. P. Thomas dissects the school 
report: 

“The school term for white schools 
is over eight months long; the school 
term for colored schools is less than 
five months long. There are high 
schools for white children in every 
parish, and no high schools for col- 
ored children in any parish at the 
present time, except Southern Univer- 
sity in New Orleans. The high schools 
all run nine months. The average 
monthly salary of the white female 
teacher is $50.80; that of the colored 
female teacher $28.67. 

“The white and colored populations 
are very nearly equal, yet the white 
teachers’ salaries amount to $2,404,- 
062.54; the colored teachers’ salaries 
amount to $202,251.13. The value of 
all schoolhouses, sites and furniture 
for whites is $6,503,019.57; the value 
of all schoolhouses, sites and furni- 
ture for colored is $273,147.50. The 
toal value of school property for col- 
ored use is $266,281.40. Number of

ing wagonettes, $7,272.37. In the 
sparsely settled country school dis- 
tricts the State furnishes wagonettes 
for the transportation of white chil- 
dren to and from school. The value 
of the wagonettes is $21,624.95, 
and the cost of operating them 
is $54,000.51. 

“Average number of white children 
transported per month per wagonette, 
7.2; average cost per month per child 
transported, $2.19. Number of white 
children transported in wagonettes 
4,088 for more than eight months at 
$2.19 per month per child. Under 
this way of encouraging white chil- 
dren to attend, the enrollment of white 
children in the public schools is 184,- 
955. Without any such encourage- 
ment and under adverse circumstances 
and with the certainty that there will 
be less than a five months’ term for 
colored schools, the enrollment of col- 
ored children in the public schools is 
78,862. Twice as many could enroll, 
but. if they did they would have to 
sit upon one another for want of ac- 
commodation.” 


In the teeth of such facts ignoraat 
editors like those above laud the Ne- 
gro public schools, but leaders of edu- 
cation like President Edmund J. 
James of the University of Illinois say 
flatly and fearlessly: “In no other na- 
tion. claiming to be civilized is there 
at the present time so large a popu- 
lation in such educational degradation 
as the American Negro!” 


PINK FRANKLIN. 


HE commutation of the death 

I sentence of Pink Franklin, of 
South Carolina, to imprison- 

ment for life is the latest step in an 


astounding American tragedy, but 
not, please God! the last. 

Here is a colored boy, the son of 
a Southern white man, a boy with a 
fair common school education, good- 
tempered, pleasant to look upon and 
a regular worker. He is arrested un- 
der a law the essential principle of 
which has since been declared uncon- 
stitutional by the Supreme Courts of 


both South Carolina and the United 
States. 

His plea of self-defense in killing 
an armed and unannounced midnight 
intruder into the very bedroom of 
himself and his wife, after he himself 
had been shot, would have absolutely 
freed any white man on earth from 
the slightest guilt or punishment. Yet 
it could not free a colored man in 
South Carolina, It brought a sentence 
of murder in the first degree. 

Governor Ansell in commuting his 
sentence to imprisonment for life did 
a brave thing. Why was it brave? 
Because it was just? No, it was un- 
just. To punish this innocent man with 
a terrible sentence—one almost worse 
than death, were it not for the hope 
ahead—is a terribly unjust deed. Yet 
Governor Ansell’s act was brave be- 
cause of public opinion in South 
Carolina; because the dominant pub- 
lic opinion of that State demanded 
this boy’s blood; because Governor 
Ansell took his political future in his 
hands when he defied this opinion. 
Honor, then, to Governor Ansell and 
to strong papers like the Columbia 
State; but what shall we say of the 
civilization of a community which 
makes moral heroism of the scantiest 
justice? 


VICTORY. 


HE colored people are getting 
so used to defeat that they 
hardly recognize victory when 

it comes or know how to herald it. 
They are developing a stolid, sombre, 
dogged silence and persistence which 
knows neither elation nor despair. 
Some day when great triumph comes 
they will burst forth in long pent-up 
gladness with a richness of emotion 
that will astonish men. 

That day is not yet come, but there 
do come in these days of little things— 
of grudging gifts from the devil of 
hate and prejudice—indications of 
larger victory, the significance of 
which we must not miss. Such were 
the four great court victories of last 
month :

20 THE CRISIS 


that they cannot break contract for 
sale of property because a man is 
black. 

2. The Supreme Court of the 
United States has declared that a law 
which compels one man to work out 
an alleged debt to another on pain of 
committing a felony establishes peon- 
age and is unconstitutional. 

3. The United States Circuit Court 
of Appeals has decided that a reserva- 
tion in a deed precluding the sale of 
the property to colored persons at any 
future time is null and void. 

4. The decision of a New York 
court that the damages awarded a 
wrongfully accused Pullman porter 
were too high because he was a Negro 
and without feelings has been reversed 
by the Appellate Division of the Su- 
preme Court of New York. 

In every one of these victories here 
recorded lies a sense of shame—to 
think that in the greatest republic of 
the twentieth century it should be nec- 
essary for a court to say that the color 
of a man’s skin was not excuse for 
breaking solemn obligations ; that slav- 
ery is illegal; that a decent human 
being is not a public nuisance and that 
there is still some difference between 
a thief and a Pullman porter. 

Yet, facing the shame, let us thank 
30d. At last the courts of the United 
States have touched bottom in the race 
problem and are turning toward jus- 
tice. After the Dred Scott decision, 
the emasculation of the Fourteenth 
Amendment and the Waterloo at Be- 
rea there were those of us who had 
come to definite decisions as to the 
United States Supreme bench. Here 
at last are glimmerings of a new 
dawn. Let the light grow and let 
us rejoice. ——— 


SEPARATION. 


T IS a cruel mental strain to which 
honest colored men are being put 
to-day, particularly in the South. 

They want to come to terms with 
their neighbors. They are being 
urged to do this—urged by black lead- 
ers and white and by strong public 
opinion. The South sometimes is 
represented as aggressively friendly. 
They are seeking piteously, therefore, 


‘to agree with the dominant race and 
yet preserve something of their self- 


respect. It is very difficult. Take, 
for instance, the letter of an honest 
colored man in the New Orleans 
Times-Democrat. He says: 


“Whatever may be the opinion of 
others concerning the drawing of the 
color line in the South, the thoughtful 
Negro has accepted it as a fixed prin- 
ciple, realizing that the race has abso- 
lutely nothing to fear or lose by social 
separation. Social intermingling has 
always meant social degradation to the 
less advanced element. It may set 
the minds of many people at rest to 
know that the Negro is willing and 
ready to meet the the most advanced 
thought of the South on its own 
ground.” 

He then swallows segregation 
whole; he would accept separate 
stores, separate physicians andslaw- 
yers, separate schools, separate school 
superintendents, separate street cars— 
all and complete, because, as he con- 
cludes: “The Negro does not desire 
racial intermingling. All he wants is 
a square deal before the law.” 

Precisely. But the thing that this 
black man would better ask himself 
good and hard is this: Is such separa- 
tion physically and politically possible, 
and under it is there the slightest like 
lihood of the segregated getting “a 
square deal”? No. Such counsellors 
of surrender stand willing to sacri- 
fice the foundations of democracy for 
peace. Why does the world ask 
equality? Out of personal bravado 
and impudence? No, but for self-pro- 
tection. If you can separate people 
by color, you can separate them by 
birth, by wealth, by ability and any 
accident. This once done and de- 
mocracy is dead before Privilege. 

Or turn to the other side: the white 
South does not want Separation, but 
Subordination. They do not want sep- 
arate Negro schools, but Negro schools 
under the control of white superinten- 
dence who hold the purse strings. 
They do not want separate cars, but 
cars which Negroes may not enter 
save as servants. They do not want 
to stop social intermingling, but they 
do want to prescribe the conditions.

In other words, the separation of 
the races which would involve polit- 
ical, economic and social independence 
in the South would be as hateful to 
them as social intermingling. Every 
man, then, that bows to the dogma of 
race separation must accept subordi- 
nation and humiliation along with the 
destruction of the best ideals of de- 
mocracy. 

Those who persist in opposition to 
it need not be scared by bugbears of 
possible intermarriage. In a true de- 
mocracy and there alone are sexual 
relations regulated by giving to all the 
right to choose their consorts. Only 
in an oligarchy like Louisiana is race 
intermingling so endless that they can- 
not enforce their own race segregation 
laws. 


SOUTHERN PAPERS. 


HERE are reasons why certain 
white Southern papers should 
be classed with Life when 
they speak on the race problem. Life 
is not as funny as it used to be, and 
these papers are a good deal funnier. 
This brings the two types into some- 
thing like competition at times. Take, 
for instance, the Charleston News and 
Courier. On most matters it is a 
sane and able newspaper, but let it 
approach the Negro problem and di- 
rectly it begins to strut and darken 
in a way that would surely excite a 
smile did it not touch so vast a trag- 
edy. When the late Alabama peon- 
age cases reached the Supreme Court 
the News and Courier lifted a porten- 
tously warning finger. Look out, it 
shouted in calmly dignified tones, look 
out! Do not interfere with the di- 
vinely established economic harmony 
of the rural South. The Negro must 
be made to work. Our methods may 
lack delicacy and ease, but—and the 
editor spread his hands—what is pe- 
onage between friends? We are sure, 
he continued, that the Supreme Court 
will hesitate long before disturbing 
laws on which Southern prosperity 
depends. 

The Supreme Court calmly over- 
threw the law. The News and Cour- 
ier did not wink an eye or turn an 
eyelash. It simply revolved toward 


the Negroes and delivered itself of 
this inimitable bit of reflection: This 
is a hard blow for you black folk— 
you'll get no more money advanced 
to you as farmhands and you'll prob- 
ably starve. On the other hand, this 
decision is a blessing for us landlords. 

All of which leads us to ask: Is the 
dominant, implacable portion of the 
white South, which speaks so loudly 
and incessantly on this race problem 
and with such perfect and breathless 
assurance—is it joking on this vast 
problem, or is it talking for effect? 

And this again, as we said in the 
beginning, makes us wild for the last 
copy of Life, Puck or Judge. 


RAMPANT DEMOCRACY. 
7 is an artist in New York 


who rose from the humblest 
circumstances and now lives 
in a suburb of the city. In his rise 
he has evidently learned the essen- 
tials of democracy, for his wife in an 
interview says that they want separate 
Negro schools in that suburb. They 
need to have them, but a very foolish 
law interfered, she laments: “We got 
along here very well with our sep- 
arate Negro school. At the same 
time the Catholic Church maintained 
a parochial school, to which most of 
the Italian children went, so that pub- 
lic schools had practically no problem 
to solve at all as to the commingling 
of children of different races.” 
Exquisite! Add to this the de- 
mand for separate Asiatic schools in 
California and we have a splendid 
start; we have but to demand, then, 
separate public schools for the rich 
and cultured. Why should Reginald 
De Courcey sit in school with Skinny 
Flynn and Isaac Baumgarten? Per- 
ish the thought! Then, too, we must 
in time distinguish between the Rich 
and the New Rich, the Real Thing 
and the Bounder. For instance, why 
should a Kentucky drummer presume 
to school his children with the lineal 
descendant of a patroon—but, notic- 
ing a deep red flush on the cheek of 
the artist's wife, we forbear to push 
this point. We merely pause to ask: 
What is democracy anyhow?

Charles Sumner 


January 6, 1911 


By Justice WENDELL PHILLIPS STAFFORD, of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia 





I will send him to my dark-browed race, 
On whom the world hath sinned; 
And he shall be as a hiding place, 
And a covert from the wind, 
As streams of water for the flock, 
Amidst the burning sand, 
The shadow of a mighty rock 


Over a weary land. 


So spake the Lord God on this day 
A hundred years agone, 
While the maids to the fainting mother say, 


See, thou hast borne a son! 


And now again in the latter year 
The Lord God speaks to-day: 

Gird up your loins like men to hear 
And answer what I say: 

Leave me the dead, they are my own: 
Yours are the sick that die, 

I cannot hear your priests intone 


For the noise of your poor that cry. 


How is it that the weak complain, 
And my children suffer harm? 
The sacrifice was naught: in vain 


The Lord made bare His arm. 


You have forgotten the camps that reached 
From rising to setting suns; 
You have forgotten the truth I preached 


By the lips of a million guns. 


The thousands who died in the prison pen, 
And the hundred thousands slain; 
Must I write it again, as I wrote it then, 


To make the lesson plain? 


See how along the dizzy steep 
Go the weak lambs unled; 

See how the thin and hungry sheep 
Look up and are not fed. 


See how the rich his web still draws 
Around and round the poor 
He sits and spins his spider laws 


To make his capture sure. 


See how the man I gave the light 
Leaves man in dark to dwell, 
And makes Religion, angel bright, 


Procuress unto hell. 


Think you I have no reins for Wrong, 
No iron curb for a check, 


When the hand of him I have made so 
strong 


Is on his brother’s neck? 


Think you the word I made my vow 
Sleeps in my prophet’s grave, 
Or that my arm is shortened now 


So that I cannot save? 


Now once again I swear 
He only shall gain who gives; 
The soul that hateth by hate shall die, 


By love the spirit lives. 


And he who will take the curse 
And carry the griefs of men, 
He shall be My Son, my Anointed One, 


The Christ that should come again! 


Till man to man by love is bound 
As man from man by law is free, 


Your bells 
sound, 


swing round with a hateful 


Your censers are a stench to me! 





God of our fathers, be with us 
As Thou wert with our sires, 

And make our midnight glorious 
With freedom’s beaconing fires; 
Show us along our cloud-wrapt way 

Some gleam of Thy garment’s hem; 
And do for us in our darkening day 


As Thou hast done for them! 


THE NEGRO AS A SOLDIER 


By Brigadier-General ANDREW S. BURT, U.S. A. (Retired) 





lecture delivered at Boston 


1910.) 


(Extracts from a 
on December 12, 

We have in our regular army four regi- 
ments of colored soldiers, the Ninth and 
Tenth Cavalry and the Twenty-fourth and 
Twenty-fifth Infantry. The two cavalry 
regiments have fine records in campaigns 
on our Western frontier, in the old days 
of Indian warfare. These troopers also 
have splendid records made in Cuba and 
the Philippines. To-day there are no 
finer horsemen who carry sabres and car 
bines than the Negro soldiers. Indeed, it 
is whispered abroad that the Tenth Regi 
ment arrived on the field of Santiago in 
the nick of time to save a much heralded 
cavalry command from being wiped out 
or otherwise rough-ridden by the Spanish 
forces. That kindly help by the Negro 
troopers has not, to my knowledge, been 
bruited about with any very loud acclaim. 
Gratitude is a fickle jade. “Where 
the wavering balance shakes ’tis 
right adjusted,” says Bobby Burns 
The Twenty-fourth Infantry has likewise 
made an enviable record in Indian war 
fare in Cuba and in the Philippines, not 
only for its fighting, but as well for its 
law-abiding conduct wherever it has served 
in this country and in foreign lands. In 
addition, this Negro regiment has the priv 
ilege of painting on her battle flag, in let- 
ters of gold, a record for a deed of mag- 
nificent moral courage and great-hearted 
humanity. In Cuba. after the f 


self 
rarely 


battle of 
Santiago, the yellow fever broke out among 


our white troops. Quarantine hospital 
camps were established for patients 
stricken down with the dread disease. 


Some weeks had elapsed when the colonel 
commanding the Twenty-fourth Regiment 
received an order to detail sixty men from 
his command to replace the regular Hospi- 
tal Corps nurses who had been attacked 
by yellow fever, and a number of whom 
had died of this sickness. 

BRAVED YELLOW 

The colonel, recognizing the peculiar 
work to be performed by his men who 
would go to the yellow fever camps, 
ordered out his regiment in line, and said 
to them: 

“Soldiers of the Twenty-fourth, I want 
sixty volunteers to help nurse your white 
comrades who are suffering with yellow 
fever.” 

He commanded: “Volunteers, three paces 
to the front. March.” 

Every man of that line stepped to the 
front! 

Sut, wait! Mark well the sequel to such 
Christian heroism. It was only a short time 


FEVER. 


before word came to the colonel that half 
of his men who had volunteered to nurse 
their white comrades had been taken down 
with yellow fever. A number of them had 


died of that terrible disease, and thirty 
more nurses were wanted to take their 
places. Again the colonel called out his 


black soldiers in line. He told them what 
had happened, and again he commanded 
“Volunteers, three paces to the front. 
March.” And again every man of that 
line stepped to the front. 

I was captain of an infantry company 
in the Civil War. That ought to make me 
a good judge of a marching column, and | 
say I never saw better marchers than my 
Twenty-fifth United States Infantry Negro 
soldiers. I dwell on this matter, for on 
the legs of his men many a general has 
depended for a victorious campaign 

The Twenty-fifth Regimental headquar- 
ters, four companies, and the band were 
stationed for more than ten years at Fort 
Missoula, Mont., near the city of that name. 
One day I asked the Democratic Mayor of 
that city how my men behaved in his baili- 
wick. He replied: 

“Why, colonel, there isn’t any class of 
citizens here more orderly and peaceful. 
The Police Court records will prove my 
assertion.” 

When the regiment was ordered to the 
front in 98, the ministers of every denomi- 
nation in Missoula joined in an open let- 
ter commending the men for their good 
behavior. 

THE 


TWENTY-FIFTH’S RECORD. 


The Twenty-fifth Infantry has made a 
record for fighting at El Caney, in Cuba, 
at Mt. Aryat, O’Donell, and in numerous 
skirmishes in the Philippines. Speaking 
of the Negro soldier generally, I can find 
nowhere in the histories of the Revolu- 
tionary War, the Indian Wars, Spanish- 
American Wars, or in the Philippines, a 
single instance where a Negro regiment 
showed the white feather or refused to 
charge the enemy shen called on to do so. 

You will recall Gen. Grant’s testimony 
before the Congressional committee on the 
conduct of the war of the rebellion. He 
said in part: “If the black troops had 
been properly supported by the white troops 
at the springing of the mines at Petersburg, 
that day we would have gone into Rich 
mond.” 

The Negro soldiers were the only ones 
to charge into and out of that hell-hole. 
Just keep that in your minds. 

Bancroft says of Bunker ilill: “Nor 
should history forget that as in the army 
at Cambridge, so also in this gallant band, 








24 THE CRISIS 


free Negroes of the colony had their repre- 
sentatives.” You all, no doubt, are familiar 
with the names of Peter Salem and Salem 
Poor, and their gallant records. 

The following account is taken from 
Arnold’s history of the Battle of Rhode 
Island: “At last the foot columns of the 
enemy massed and swept down the slopes 
of Anthony’s Hill, with the impetuosity of 
a whirlwind, but they were received by the 
American troops with the courage and calm- 
ness of veterans. The loss on both sides 
was fearful. It was in repelling these 
furious onsets that the newly raised black 
regiment, under Col. Greene, distinguished 
itself by deeds of desperate valor.” 

Let me call your attention to a trait of 
the Negro soldier: his devotion and loyalty 
to his leader. On May 14, 1780, Col. 
Greene, the gallant leader of this regiment, 
was surprised and murdered at Point 
Bridges, New York. He had a very small 
bodyguard with him at the time, composed 
of his faithful black soldiers, These men 
could have fled from an overwhelming 
force and saved their lives, but surround- 
ing their colonel they defended him gal- 
lantly and he was not killed until the last 
man was cut to pieces. 


IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. 


Baron von Clausen, a German army 
officer, who visited this country during the 
Revolutionary War, said, among other 
things, in describing his visit to Gen. Wash- 
ington’s camp, that of the 20,000 soldiers 
there, 5,000 were Negroes, and that the 
best-drilled and disciplined regiment was 
Col. Greene’s Rhode Island regiment, three- 
fourths of which was composed of Negroes. 

Time will not permit me to dwell in de- 
tail upon the Negro’s military service in 
the War of 1812. Commodore Perry on 
Lake Erie, and Gen. Jackson at New Orleans 
have testified in signed communications to 
the War and Navy Departments of their 
unflinching courage. Jackson’s victory at 
New Orleans, which carried him to fame 
and the White House, he owed largely to 
the desperate valor of the black regiments 
under him. I wonder if you grasp the 
significance of all that? Why, look at it! 
Jackson, the great apostle of democracy, 
was boosted up the ladder of fame by the 
faithful, patriotic, fighting black man. Does 
not that seem to be the limit of the irony 
of fate? 

In the Civil War 187,000 Negroes were 
enlisted. They participated in 213 battles 
and engagements, and never permitted the 
Union colors to be dishonored by cowardice 
or treachery. Their brilliant achievements 
at Forts Wagner and Olustee, Fort Hudson, 
and Milliken’s Bend, made them welcome 
into the flower of the Union army—the 
army of the Potomac in the closing 
months of those bloody conflicts in front 
of Richmond and Petersburg. In the bat- 
tles of Wilson’s Wharf, Deep Bottom, 
Chapeirs Farm, and Hatchers Run, they 
won for themselves immortal glory! 


A TALE OF HEROISM. 


Let me relate to you one instance in this 
war, equal in sublimity to the martial 
deeds of any age. It is worthy of Homer, 
for nothing at the siege of Troy surpasses 
it in valor, 

After the black troops had made a third 
unsuccessful assault to carry the heights 
of Port Hudson, and had left hundreds of 
their dead and dying comrades under the 
very guns of the enemy, Gen. Payne, a 
Union officer, fell, seriously wounded, 
about three hundred yards in front of the 
Union entrenchments. With great exer- 
tion he had managed to crawl to a point 
behind rock and bushes which concealed 
his body from the view of the Confederate 
rifles in the pits on the slope of the hill. 
How to get him back in the Union lines 
was the problem confronting the Union 
officers. To leave him there much longer 
without surgical aid was almost certain 
death. To send a rescuing party under 
orders meant almost certain death to every 
man in it, as the ground over which they 
would be compelled to pass was swept by 
a regiment of guns. 

In this extremity the matter was put be- 
fore the Negro troops, and two volunteers 
were called for to make the attempt to 
get the general. Instantly two men stepped 
forward and started on a run for the 
officer, who lay insensible from fatigue and 
loss of blood. One of them fell shot to 
pieces after having gone a few paces. The 
other fell before he had covered half the 
distance. 

The fate of these two men was met by 
two others who volunteered without hesi- 
tation. Two more, undeterred by the fate 
of their comrades, which they had wit- 
nessed with thousands of others on both 
sides of the lines, stepped forward and 
went to death, and this appalling sacri- 
fice of life was kept up until the general’s 
body was finally reached and brought back 
into the lines, while a thousand guns were 
thundering and bullets were singing their 
death song, carrying eighteen of the 
bravest men who ever lived into the final 
muster out, 

So profoundly impressed was Gen. Lee 
with the invincible military quilities of 
the Negro soldiers that in a letter which he 
wrote to Jefferson Davis, urging the pas- 
sage of a bill authorizing their enlistment, 
then under debate in the Confederate Con- 
gress, he said: 

“Tf I can get these men, there is no tell- 
ing where this campaign will end.” 


NEGRO SOLDIERS OF HISTORY. 


As far back as the days of Alexander 
the Great we find black men exerting high 
military command. Clitus, a black soldier, 
led Alexander’s cavalry and saved the day 
on more than one occasion by his forced 
marches and genius for command. Rome 
was made to tremble at the dreaded name 
of the great Carthaginian captain. Mene- 
lik’s army; led entirely by black men on 





THE NEGRO AS A SOLDIER 25 


the plains of Addis-Abeba, annihilated an 
Italia army of 30,000 men, taking 1,000 
prisoners of war. Cetewayo, the indomi- 
table Zulu chief, measured arms with the 
ablest English commanders, and although 
his military resources were antiquated, he 
was never conquered. In Brazil, a full- 
blooded Negro, Henry Diaz, wrested his 
country from the iron grip of the Dutch. 
Maceo in Cuba, David Thomas Dumas in 
France, division general under the First 
Napoleon, and Gen. Alfred Dodds, to-day 
the idol of the French army, refute the 
charge that Negroes lack military capacity 
to lead. 
CAPABLE NEGRO OFFICERS. 


In our own country much of the des- 
perate fighting at Port Hudson was done 
by those Negro soldiers, under the leader- 
ship of Negro officers in those regiments 
recruited in Louisiana, which became pop- 
ularly known as the Corps D’Afrique. In 
the Cuban campaign, many of the com- 
panies of Negro soldiers were led by Negro 
non-commissioned officers, and there is no 
doubt that, among the 300 Negro officers 
of volunteers commissioned during the 
war with Spain, there were men who would 
have measured up well in an emergency. 


The story of Diaz's organization of a 
black regiment, officered entirely by men 
of his own race, his brilliant campaigns 
against the Dutch, make one of the im- 
portant chapters in the history of the west- 
ern hemisphere, for this man emancipated 
his country from the hard hand of a stub- 
born, masterful race, and his countrymen 
have deservedly placed him in the class 
with Bolivar, Washington, and L’Ouver- 
ture, the great liberators and founders of 
states in the western world. 


In conclusion, I take pride in naming to 
you the greatest soldier, white or black, in 
ancient or modern wars—the Negro Han- 
nibal. Field Marshal Von Moltke, of the 
German army, the eminent military critic, 
says: “Hannibal is the greatest military 
genius in history.” I will not detain you 
by going into details of how Hannibal 
landed his little army of 37,000 Cartha- 
ginians in the heart of the Roman Empire 
and battled successfully for seventeen long 
years with the veteran legions of Rome. 
I will sum it all up in these words: 

“When Hannibal flashed his sword from 
its scabbard, the boundaries of the broad 
empire of Rome oscillated on the map. He 
was the Archangel of War.”

A Black Statesman of the Last Century 


By Dr. FRANCES HOGGAN, of London, England 





Moshesh, “the Conqueror,” is a very 
striking figure among the black rulers of 
South Atrica. He might be an early 
Roman gathering in adherents from neig 
boring tribes Like many another 
man of marked personality, he has 
maligned, accused of treachery 
he never committed, but more fortunately 
than some, he is not altogether misrepre 
sented, and he had soine friends who have 
done justice to his force of character and 
intellect 





black 
been 
and crimes 


He lived in the early half of the nine- 


teenth century, dying in 1869, and was 
chief of the Basutos. Pressed on all sides, 
encroached upon by Boer and_ Briton 


alike, threatened with extermination by 
the mighty Zulu host, Moshesh displayed, 
on a small theatre, it is true, the most 
remarkable diplomatic aptitude and _ skill. 
Like Cavour, many of whose qualities he 
possessed in no small degree, he pushed 
forward with the single-minded aim of 
safeguarding the rights and liberties of his 
people Like Cavour also, he knew the 
value of compromise, and whenever he be- 
came convinced that downright justice had 
no chance of triumphing he turned his 
shrewd, subtle intellect toward securing 
the attainable maximum of justice and 


fair dealing which the circumstances ot 
the period rendered possible. With a 
clearsightedness one could not have ex- 


pected in an unlearned black chief, he early 
realized that the hope of his country lay 
in cultivating friendly relations with the 


English, and from this position no ill- 
treatment, double-aealing or injustice 
could turn -him.* 


Just as his clear mental vision enabled 
Moshesh as a young man to select for 
his stronghold Thaba_ Bosigo, a _ flat 
shaped and natvrally fortified mountain 
which a few could hold against an army, 
and from which he was never dislodged 
either by Zulus, Boers or English, so he 
saw with prophetic eye the Basuto, shorn 
of much that rightfully belonged to them, 
yet prosperous, semi-independent and 
strong under the protecting care of the 
Great White Queen. Therefore, at a time 
when the fortune of war was wavering 
between him and the English under Gen- 
era! Cathcart, and when he had even 
gained certain advantages against them, just 
when a savage chief would have exulted in 
the possibility of massacre or at any rate, of 
temporary bloodshed, Moshesh, who had 
learned the hard lesson of self-conquest, 
chose that moment to send an envoy suing 
for peace, when indeed it could not well 
be refused. His letter, simple, direct and

ever written in South Africa.” 


Thaba Bosigo, 
Midnight, 20th December, 1852. 
Your Excellency, 

This day you have fought against our 
people and taken much cattle. As the ob- 
ject for which you have come is to obtain 
cattle for the Boers, I beg you will be 
satished with what you have taken. | 
entreat peace from you. You have shown 
your power. You have chastised. Let it 
be enough, I pray you; and let me no 
longer be considered as an enemy to the 
Queen. I will try all I can to keep my 
people in order for the ftfture, 

Your humble servant, 
MosHEsH.+ 


General Cathcart, feeling himself some- 
what cornered, therevpon made peace. 
This may serve as a specimen of Moshesh’s 
relations with the English. With the Boers 
subsequently he was more unbending, and 
in return for the slight consideration ac 
corded to many of his well-founded claims, 
he inflicted on them a protracted retalia 


tory border warfare, in the course of 
which numerous successful raids on their 
cattle took place. When, however, the 
Boers were roused into energetic action, 


and their tactics and military skill threat- 
ened to overwhelm him and _ his people, 


diplomacy again came to his aid, and 
Moshesh obtained from the English, in 
answer to his urgent entreaty, the favor 


of having a Protectorate proclaimed over 
the whole of the Basuto territory in 1868. 

With the Zulus and the Matabele Mos- 
hesh showed himself both warlike and as- 
tute. After repulsing Moselikatze and his 
horde from Thaba Bosigo, he is said to 
have sent them a present of oxen for food. 
They thereupon declared that they would 
never fight him again, and they never did; 
but numbers of the Matabele came in after- 
wards to live under his rule. This may 
be a legendary story, and so also may be 
the well-known witty reply to those who 
accused Moshesh of too great leniency in 
his dealings with some of his people whom 
want had driven into cannibalism. “I have 
always been taught to respect the graves 
of my ancestors.” These stories have a 
flavor of the man about them, whether his- 
torically true or not. Moshesh is one 
round whom legend quickly gathers, as it 
does round so many other popular heroes.

his missionaries is characteristic of the 
man in private life. I give the story as

tion. A young woman, one of Moshesh’s 
many wives, was out one day cultivating 
her land, when a great light shone round 
her. She was amazed and frightened, and 
sought counsel of a Christian friend, ask- 
ing her what she thought the light could 
have been. This friend said she did not 
know, that perhaps God had let his light 
shine on her to lead her to himself, and 
that she advised her to go and tell the 
Chief. At first the young woman hesi 
tated, fearing to disturb the Chief with 
her small affairs, but eventually she did 
tell him. “My child,” said he, “go on 
Sundays to the Mission church; listen at- 
tentively, and come always and tell me 
what is said.” This she did obediently for 
about a year. Then one day Moshesh 
called her to him, and said he was going 
to send her home to her father (his way 
of releasing her from her union with him) 
and that, if her father consented, she 
might join the Christian church. This, 
after some time, she did. 

For a polygamous chief this treatment 
of the young wife, as related, is singularly 
gentle and wise. Other testimony points 
also to kindly domestic relations. Moshesh 
was one of Nature’s gentlemen, dignified. 
considerate, courteous, hardy as to personal 
habits, alert and possessed in an unusual 
degree, of good judgment, discretion and 
wisdom. The marvel is that he had such 
an intuitive knowledge of how to deal with 
both savage and civilized foes and to make 
the best of the situation in which he found 
himself. What Germans call mother wit 
was one of his distinguishing characteris- 
tics, and to this must be added charm of 
manner and an uncommon faculty for con 
ciliation and gaining his ends by peaceful 
means. Taken altogether, Moshesh shows 
us native life and tribal rule at its best, 
and he is a most picturesque representa- 
tive of a régime, too rapid'v perhaps pass- 
ing away. which was not devoid of suita- 
bility to its environment in the hands of 
a capable man. Moshesh is but one of 
many great chiefs whom Africa has pro- 
duced. What distinguishes him from all 
the rest is mainly the diplomatic turn of 
mind which in him was so conspicuous a 
feature as to call for special mention and 
comment. 

Moshesh was the founder of the Basuto 
nationality, compact, progressive. patriotic, 
sure to persist and survive changes of 


administration and system. The Basuto 
are a monument of his genius. Recruited 
from many and various tribes, with a 
strong Zulu element pervading it, the Ba- 
suto nation as we know it to-day in the 
Protectorate of that name, inhabits a beau- 
tiful mountainous country about the size of 
Switzerland, intersected by fruitful valleys, 
and affording fine grazing grounds to large 
herds of cattle, and to the strong, hardy 
Basuto ponies which the country breeds. 
The paramount chief, Letsie, is a slave 
to the strong liquor which unprincipled 
white men have smuggied into the country, 
contrary to government regulations. He 
is not devoid of good qualities, but he is 
weak, as those under the slavery of drink 
always are. <As an illustration of the 
sturdiness which may be found in Basuto- 
land to-day, | may relate that, on a visit 
paid a few months ago to Maseru, the ad- 
ministrative capital, I saw the female pris- 
oners, in for murder, infanticide and theft, 
who are marched daily across the town, 
from one end to the other and back to the 
Hospital (where they do the washing and 
rough work), by the native wardress, Leah, 
who controls them easily without the help 
of any weapon. The male prisoners were 
in the charge of fully armed warders. 

The career of Moshesh is instructive as 
showing what may be the outcome of such 
training as native chiefs undergo in tribal 
life, under the guidance of counselors and 
older men of the tribe—a practical educa- 
tion of considerable value, which it is cus- 
tomary to overlook, but which is in many 
cases fruitful of results. Education as 
we understand it Moshesh never had, and 
his outlook on life was bounded by the 
necessities of his people, as is the case 
with Khama at the present day. Moshesh’s 
life, however, is illustrative of the great 
world-wide fact that, whereas talent and 
mediocrity require careful cultivation and 
good educational methods, genius bursts 
forth irrespective of methods or special 
training, and dazzles the world by its 
brightness and force. 

As a result of the great work of Mos- 
hesh we have to-day Basutoland, an Eng- 
lish Crown colony of South Africa, almost 
entirely self-governing, with nearly 300,000 
inhabitants, with annual exports of grain. 
cattle and wool amounting to $700.000 a 
year.

TALKS ABOUT WOMEN 


NUMBER THREE 


By Mrs. JOHN E. MILHOLLAND 





Much has been written and said about 
the great movement of women’s clubs 
all over America—East, West, North and 
South. This has perhaps been mostly 
talked of here in our home city where one 
is familiar with hundreds of these splendid 
working bodies—all doing interesting things 
—but organized and run mostly for and 
by women interested in progress for 
women of their own class and. color. 
Therefore, it is with the greatest satisfac- 
tion as well as surprise to find that the 
colored women also have their own large 
organizations established all over this coun- 
try, each doing a work quite on a plane 
with anything yet attempted by other Amer- 
ican women. In Number 14 of the Atlanta 
University Publications, there is a most 
thorough and graphic account of these 
clubs, revealing a spirit of progress and 
organization most remarkable considering 
the drawbacks these colored women have 
encountered and the comparatively short 
time in which they have had not alone 
opportunity, but even the privilege of work- 
ing for the development and culture of 
their own sex. 


In referring to that quite remarkable 
organization, “The National Association of 
Colored Women,” Mrs. Josephine S. Yates, 
the Honorary President, writes as follows: 

“An inquiry into existing organizations 
among our women reveals the fact that 
most of these are auxiliary societies 
founded and controlled by men, or by the 
combined efforts of men and women; also, 
that usually they are secret orders, or con- 
nected with various church denominations ; 
and, furthermore, that in their respective 
fields much work of high order has been 
accomplished. 


“There is, however, one notable exception 
to the rule stated in the previous paragraph 
relative to organizations of women, and this 
is to be found in the ‘National Association 
of Colored Women, an_ organization 
founded and controlled entirely by women.” 

This Colored Women’s Association has 
held its conventions in the various cities of 
the South and West with much success. 
That these meetings were well thought of 
and their business methods approved is 
shown by the following editorial from the 
Daily News, of Chicago, whose editor says: 

“Of all the conventions that have met in 
the country this summer there is none that 
has taken hold of the business in hand with 
more good sense and judgment than the 
National Association of Colored Women, 
now assembled in this city. The subjects 
brought up, the manner of their treatment 
and the decisions reached exhibit wide and 


appreciative knowledge of conditions con- 
fronting the colored people.” 

The National Association of Colored 
Women has many departments, comprising 
all sorts and variety of club work. Its 
branches are to be found in many of the 
large cities in the West. Federations of 
these clubs comprising in some instances 
as many as forty-five clubs in one State 
have been formed, all doing active and use- 
ful work. The Virginia president reports 
as follows: 

“We have connected with the State Fed- 
eration of Colored Women of Virginia, 
clubs whose members are actively engaged 
in home, school, church, village improve- 
ment, rescue work, and social settlements, 
and they are doing good work. These clubs 
had been organized and working long be- 
fore the State Federation was organized, so 
that explains how we can do so much work 
in so short a time, 

“At our Second Annual Meeting, held in 
Richmond, June 17 and 18, 1909, forty- 
seven clubs, representing 1,200 women, were 
reported.” 

In referring to the Mississippi organiza- 
tion, the president of the Vicksburg club 
writes: 

“The women of Vicksburg, after several 
attempts, succeeded in 1905 in effecting a 
permanent organization. These clubwomen 
were banded together to do charity work, 
but for a long time could not decide what 
work was most necessary. They finally con- 
cluded that some provision for caring for 
the old folks and orphans should be made. 
This work was immediately undertaken by 
them. They began at once to solicit funds 
from the people of this immediate vicinity 
for the purpose. They had to overcome the 
difficulties common to all incipient work. 
Many felt that nothing would ever come of 
the movement and refrained from taking a 
part. 

“Notwithstanding this, they selected a 
suitable lot about a mile from Vicksburg, 
containing a large antebellum residence, 
and contracted to buy the same for $1,200. 

“They have now paid for the place. They 
have bought also two smaller lots in the 
same locality, and are now collecting funds 
to repair the Home, after which they intend 
to open it for the reception of the aged 
poor. 

“They have no permanent source of sup- 
port. Their collections have been made 
solely in this community of Vicksburg, 
Miss.” 

And so the report goes on to relate most 
interestingly the success which has crowned 
the efforts of these pioneers of the colored 
women’s organizations all over America,

\ great deal is made of the fact that 
Negroes are peculiarly susceptible to tuber- 
culosis, but little is done to prevent the 
spread of the disease; instead it is blithely 
propagated by the villainous jim-crow car. 
A colored woman, familiar with many cities 
of the North and of Europe, writes thus of 
her recent experience in traveling in the 
South: 

“Some of the cars have’ been filthy. I 
never permit Mary (her daughter) to sit 
until I have cleaned the seat; we have used 
newspapers, wash-rags, even our handker- 
chiefs, and then have thrown them away, 
they have been so black. 


“Leaving Atlanta for Rome the other 
evening, the car was stifling with the odor 
of decayed fruit. Two cuspidors filled 
with apple cores and banana peel and the 
news agent’s fruit-stand helped things 
along. The train had been two and a half 
hours late, the seats were particularly filthy, 
and I was ‘afire” I asked the conductor 
if there was no one to throw the garbage 
out, and he answered that there was no 
one. He was not impolite, but seemed as- 
tonished at my nerve. I had a terrible 
cough; Mary had one also. I could hardly 
gasp. I opened the window over one cuspi- 
dor and pinned newspapers up to protect 
Mary and myself from the draught. I was 
really afraid to breathe the fetid air. 


“The white news agent opened his win- 
dow shortly after this. Two friends of 
his, one a cripple, came, and the cripple 





BURDEN 


lit a cigarette. I said to him, ‘Please 
do not smoke in here; it is bad enough as 
it is.” He said nothing, but he did not 
smoke.” 

And so the letter continues. The cars 
are swept only when the passengers are in 
them, the dust thus flying into eyes and 
throat; and the letter ends, “I think the 
tuberculosis society needs to direct its at- 
tention to the spread of consumption among 
Negroes through their enforced use ot 
cars allowed to remain in a vile condition. 
I know these cars transmit disease. Won't 
the Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People make a war-cry on this 
matter? The health of the whole com- 
munity is involved in it.” 


The Reverend H. H. Proctor, of At- 
lanta, is one of the most prominent colored 
ministers of the South. Not long ago he 
arranged to take a trip to the Holy Land 
with a party of white clergymen. When 
he applied for his ticket, the Boston book- 
ing agent, seeing that he was colored, re- 
fused to sell to him. There would be 
Southern ministers in the party he said. 
These spiritual leaders could not journey 
with a colored man through the country 
of the Christ. 





When we begin to harbor race prejudice 
we cannot tell where it will end or how 
deeply we shall injure the opportunities 
of others. A colored girl in a city of a 
border State, wishing to study art, was 
admitted to a class of white students’ on 
the condition that she would allow a 
screen to be placed around her seat. Her 
presence might then at least be ignored. 

But more recently in another State, Ten- 
nessee, a brilliant music student was de- 
nied the right, even when in a class alone, 
to study at her profession. Having been 
received by a German musician as a pupil, 
she was told after returning from a vaca- 
tion that she might no longer come to his 
studio. “I regret it deeply,” he said, 
“but the prejudice among my other pupils 
is such that I endanger my means of liveli- 
hood by receiving you.” 

Could anything have been more patheti- 
cally absurd than the sight of the grand 
opera at Atlanta last winter, to which the 
most musical part of the population, the 
Negroes, were denied admittance? 


In these days when the world is full of 
important and interesting happenings, when 
democracy struggles for new life in Portu- 
gal and Mexico, when England faces a 
revolution, it is a matter for amazement

COMPELLED TO DANCE 
WITH NEGRO, SHE SAYS 


N, Times, Jan. 17, 1911 
A young schoolgirl, full of a foolish 
self-consciousness, finds herself in front 


of a colored boy and obliged to take a 
few steps with him in a general dance 
She shows herself as little girl not yet 
trained to be polite to everyone whether 
considered by her a superior or an infe 
rior; and, behold, some of ovr august dis 





tributors of news make her a prominent 
feature and give a colvmn on their fir

show more clearly that, as 
has said, we are stil “a

The story reminds us of another that was 
related of a private school in Massachu 
setts. This school had pupils from all over 
the country, and sometimes colored 
dren were among them. One time, in the 
dancing class, a Southern prpil, a_ boy, 
found himself in front of a colored girl

for a time s ayed away, but finally decided

to the class and to his duty as it had been 
shown him. 

Shortly after this his mother visited the

that if the mother did not wish her son to

to be the gentleman whom Stevenson has
