<h1>A Program for a Sociological Society<a class="headerlink" href="#a-program-for-a-sociological-society" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<h2>Atlanta University<br>1897</h2>
<p>I desire this afternoon to read to the First Sociological Club a
candid criticism of its’ work and a suggestion for its’ future activity.
I do this the more boldly because I am a member of the organization and as such must bear my part of the responsibility for its’ short­ comings; and at the same time, I speak as an outsider, for in the year that I have had my name on the rolls I have had no opportunity to share in the work of the club. I always hear with a certain foreboding shiver of the formation of a club for any kind of sociological work, for my experience has taught me that the percentage of absolute failure among
such clubs is very large. The trouble is apt to be that the persons forming clubs for social reform have very vague ideas of what the science of sociology really is, and what is the real aim and object of their striving. Consequently it can easily happen that they drift aimlessly on until the members begin to wonder whether it is worthwhile to waste so much time doing nothing. I fancy I have seen in this club something of the same tendency, and it seems to me that the great need of this organization is a clearer conception of its’ aims and more practical
and persistent work to accomplish these objects.</p>
<p>I have therefore chosen for my subject <em>A Program for a Sociological Society</em>, and I want to divide what I have to say in six parts. First I want to show what Sociology is. Second— What the science has accomplished. Third— By what methods its work has been done. Fourth— How the material and knowledge thus collected can best be utilized. Fifth— What the society has already accomplished and why, And finally what this society might and ought to do.</p>
<section id="st-what-is-sociology">
<h2>1st. What is Sociology<a class="headerlink" href="#st-what-is-sociology" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There was a vast revolution which took place in the early part of
this century that is too often forgotten by educated people. It came after that terrible upheaval of human institutions which we call the French Revolution, after the orgies of Robespierre, Danton, and Marat, and became finally the great instrument that freed Europe from the grasp of the arch-tyrant Napoleon. This revolution was the industrial revolution of the 19th century. It began in the 18th century, when the science of chemistry was first well established, when geology gained a sure foundation when Brinley showed the world how to dig canals uphill, when iron began to be smelted by coal instead of charcoal, and above all when James Watt turned a tea-kettle into a steam engine. Such epoch-making inventions changed the civilization of the world and with the dawn of the 19th century came an industrial revolution — factories started up, towns grew, commerce expanded, capital increased, the world market widened. If we regard this industrial movement more carefully we shall see that of all departments of human industry the manufacture of cotton made the most gigantic strides in this epoch. The ancient world dressed in wool, the middle age in wood and linen, the modern world dressed largely in cotton. The series of inventions that made cotton manufacture possible are a curious example of coincidence. Between the years 1775 and 1825, Arkwright Hargreaves, Cartwright, and Eli Whitney had changed the spinning wheel into the factory and made the southern United States the cotton field of the world.</p>
<p>This industrial revolution had serious consequences: first it fastened American Slavery in this country and made emancipation more difficult, and the Negro problem more baffling; More that that in all lands it gave rise to and intensified those intricate questions of life and death and civilization which we call social problems: human being were, by the new concentration of industrys, crowded into centers of population and the difficulties, deseases, and maladjustments of human life became intensified and more patent to the eye. Crime, poverty, desease, prostitution,
ignorance, and death began to assume threatening proportions. Men came to be attracted to these sinister phenomena and to ask what they real­ly meant, how far they were remediable, and how far inevitable.</p>
<p>There was then but one science which undertook the study of the phenomena of human action and th twas the science of political economy. But this science was limited in scope: it began in the 17th nd 18th century when the phenomena of money and international trade first assumed importance and confined itself simply to a study of wealth: it asked how goods were produced, how they were distributed among the producers, and
how their owners exchanged them for other goods. It thus took into account only a feW human activities under stable conditions of society. The industrial revolution, however, had greatly changed conditions, and brought
a distinct demand for wider inquiry into the causes and scope of human action —  deeper search for the reasons of present conditions and the intelligent application  of such knowledge to methods of social regenerat­ion. This was the beginning of th modern science of Sociology.</p>
<p>Sociology is therefore the name given to that vaat field of inquiry into human action aa manifested in modern organized life. It cannot study all human action under all circumstances, but thay human action
which by its regularity gives evidence of the presence of laws.
What these laws are we hardly know, and yet we do know that
there are in life cur­ious and noticeable coincidences — rythm in life and death, a working out of cause and effect, evidenes of force action and reaction, which cannot be ignored or neglected. Many eminent men still insist that this mass of partially digested facts cannot be called a science — and indeed if you mean by science, a body knowledge with definitely stated laws, and carefully systematized facts, then Sociology is not yet a science and may never become one. But if you mean by Sociology a vast and fruitful field of inquiry into the mysterious phenomena of human action, which
has yielded evidence of the working of scientific laws to some extent, and
promises much for the future — if such a work deserves, as many
think, the name of science, then Sociology is one of the greatest of sciences.</p>
<p>But it is impossible to tell what a science is merely by defining it — the definition is the last thing a science discovers — indeed it	can truth­fully be said that no science can be fully defined until it is perfect, until its work is done. The best explanation of a science then is a deecription of the sort of work it is doing and what it has already accomplished.
I come therefore to the second point in my talk.</p>

<section id="nd-what-has-sociology-done">
<h2>2nd. What has Sociology done?<a class="headerlink" href="#nd-what-has-sociology-done" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Sociology has studied the proportionate number of the two sexes in the
different countries, the number of people of different ages, the number of
births each year in different localities, the number of deaths from various
diseases, the size of families, the average number of rooms in dwellings,
the extent of illiteracy, the number of communicants in the different churches
the occupations which men pursue, the income from their work, the way that
income is expended; the number of the blind, deaf, dumb, and insane, the
extent and degree of poverty, the prevalence of suicide, the extent and
kinds of crime, the characteristics of criminals, the distribution and
migration of population, the distribution of property, etc. Moreover it
has sought to generalize much of this mass of facts and show how all these
actions and phenomenas tend to a certain rhythm and regularity which we
call the social group. In the social group the distribution of the sex
and age of the individuals remain continually about the same despite birth
and death, and the rate of births and deaths varies so little that it can
be predicted within limits. The income, occupation, expenditure, and
crime tends in the same way under forms of law. This so-called Social
Law seems partly voluntary, partly involuntary, but in all cases its
regularity is much greater than the casual reader dreams. These social groups
in turn combine to form that higher generalization which we call Society.
Society is simply a general name for the regularities of human action — for
the general fact that when 50, 100, Oor 1,000,000 live together they
do not all act irresponsibly or at random but according to well-known
maxims, social forces and laws.</p>
<p>All this that I have said can best be illustrated by a few actual
examples. In Europe, for instance, repeated investigation has proven
that for every 1,000 males there are about 1,024 females. This is
Characteristic of old countries. In the United States, on the other
hand there are only 952 females for every 1,000 males. In the older,
eastern states, however, we should expect to find conditions approaching
those in Europe — and sure enough there are 1,005 females to every 1,000
males. To show the significence of such facts let us go a step farther:
We find in the city of Baltimore 1,310 Negro women to every 1,000 men.
We can immediately say this is surely an abnorman situation and must have
something to do with the large number of illegitimate births in that city.</p>
<p>Statistics of age show that in normal countries about one third of
the population is under 15 years of age, yet the nations vary considerably:
for instance take children under 10 years of age; in England they
form 24% of the population, in France only 18%, among the Negroes of
the land 28%. Turning now to the old people 60 and over and we find
that they form 7% of the population of England; 13% of that of France;
and 2% among our race. Such differences simply mean poor family life
among our people.</p>
<p>The statistics of births and deaths are always of great interest
and consequently liable to misuse. We may have two especially marked
types: a population with a low birth-rate and low death-rate like
France or a population with a high birth rate and high death rate like
American Negro. The latter is a sign of a low standard of culture —
early marriage, illegitimacy and neglect of the laws of health; the
the former is usually a sign of high civilization — postponement of
marriage until the support of a family is assured, and life according
to the laws of hygiene. Son in the same country the character of a
community may easily be approximately fixed by measuring the number
of people in every thousand that die annually. A death rate above 26
is high, while one above 30 points to grave dangers. The rate may be
as low as 18 as in Norway. The average death rate of Negroes in cities
is 34.</p>
<p>Where socilolgical inquiry reveals great differences in the conditions
of different groups of people this is usually evidence of some
unseen cause which makes the variation. For instance, we can represent
the occupations of the people of Philadelphia by the following set of
door steps:</p>
<p>FIGURE 1</p>
<p>If however we represent the occupations of the Negroes of the city,
we find the steps hard for climbing.</p>
<p>FIGURE 2</p>
<p>What is the meaning of this striking difference? It is explained
fully by one comprehensive word SLAVERY. Thus history writes itself in
figures and diagrams.</p>
<p>In the matter of crime, sociology has done some of its best work;
let us notice only one — the connection of crime and age. In Germany
for instance it has been found that 15% of all persons between 21 and
40 have been convicted for crime, 9% of those between 40 and 60, and
7% of those between 12 and 18 years of age. Further analyzing these
figures it is found that the most criminal age is between 20 and 30,
and among young unmarried men. Taking for instance the Negro criminal
in the Eastern section of Pennsylvania; we find the remarkable fact
that 67% of them were under 30 years of age and 11% under 20.</p>
<p>Using such minute and detailed statistics sociology has built up
the theory of the social group. The country village is a social group.
Its population distributed in a certain normal order as to age and sex
and conjugal condition. Its birth and death regulating the increase of
population. There is some crime, a school, a church, a village store.
The population is divided among different occupations, social classes
make a faint appearance and there is a general public opinion which
represents of synthesis of like ideas. Such a group may grow to a city or
to a nation, but as it grows we note certain peculiarities:	it forms
within itself other smaller groups for special purposes — clubs for
amusement or reading, church societies, associations of capital and
labor called shops or companies or factories and etc. These sub-groups
we might call organs for carrying out the special work of society, just
as the tissues of the body form here a heart and here an eye to serve
the whole organism of the body. This we refer to when we speak of society
being organized — of course this is but an analogy for the organization
of society is far from complete and individual free will must
ever hinder that consummation in this world. Nevertheless advance in
civilization is to a certain extent advance in the perfecting of the
organization of society.</p>
<p>Such is the work that Sociology has accomplished. It is to be sure
only a beginning: our statistics are woefully imperfect. Our methods of
observation are crude and the material at hand is largely an unclassified
mass of facts, the value of which is various and uncertain.
Nevertheless gigantic strides have been taken in the last 10 years, something has
been done, and the outlook for the future is bright. This brings me to
the fourth point I wish to discuss.</p>
<h2>4th. The Use of Sociological Material</h2>
<p>The interest in social reform and general betterment which animates</p>
<p>so many excellent people today must not be mistaken for the science of</p>
<p>u</p>
<p>Sociology. There are many people who have a va^jfe desire to right wrongs,</p>
<p>help the needy, and reform the vicious. Unfortunately these people in</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>very many instanses arp ignorant of the results of scientific research in
these lines - th^y do not know the value and meaning of statistics and
they often waste money and energy, or do absolute harm, either by anti-
\ quated or discredited methods. If anyone should inform an ordinary
^ citizen that chemists had discovered a new element, Argon - he would say
very well or bravo I and be done - he would not attempt to discuss the
matter or draw conclusions - he is no chemist and does not attempt to be.
If he wishes to use the results of chemical research he seeks the advice
of a chemist. In the realm of sociology, however, the case is very
different: tell a man that the death rate of the Negroes is 36, and
immediately he is ready to discuss the matter, write articles, form clubs,
and sp^nd mon^y although he knows that he is not an expert in statistics
or a student of sociology. What ought to happen in this case is clear:
the man ought to say candidly that he knows nothing about death rates -
is 36 high or low or medium? What has been the history of the variation
of d^ath rates? How do the daath rates of different peoples compare with
this*?1 A sensible man ought to ask: What does a death rate of 36 mean:
what in the light of the expert statistical knowledge and the careful
sociological research of the last quarter century, is the proper inter-
pretation of this figure 36, which otherwise is to me a Sphinx and an
enigma.</p>
<p>The civilized and thinking part of the modern world is gradually and
surely coming to this position. The first thing people ask of social
reformers now in not how earnest are you or how great is the need of re-
form but rather what do you know about the actual situation and how does
the best of -xp-&gt;rt opinion interpret these facts. Men recognize the fact
that such expert opinion may err but they are coming to see that the
occasional error of men who give th^ir life to knowing is not as dangerous
as th° p rp~tual -rror of mm who guess or dogmatize. The facts and the
meaning of th* facts are then the first steps in modern social reform.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>How now 3hall the mass of intelligent people who have not time to
be experts put themselves in position to use the material collected by
sociologists in the practical work of reform? We can best answer inis
by seeing the work done in reform during this century.</p>
<p>One of the first movements was the English Abolition of the slave-</p>
<p>»</p>
<p>‘J* trade:	for this the House of Commons collected a mass of statistics -</p>
<p>fV)</p>
<p>the numb-r of ships engaged, the amount of capital invested, the methods
employed to capture slaves, the routes of sailing, the number transport-
ed, the death rate among slaves and sailors, and etc. They soughtthe
history of the subject, the general conditions, the opinions of exports
statisticians and when they began to legislate on the subject they knew
what they were doing and no nation had done so much to stop Negro slav-
ery as these same Englishmen who studied the matter so thoroughly.</p>
<p>Again take the matter of prison reform. When the question was first
agitated there wasn’t a crank in England or America that hadn’t an opin-
ion and a panacea - It was do this, do that, make their punishment as
severe as that of galley slaves; treat them as unfortunate victims of
society; make their work hard, let them lie idle; hang them, give them
tracts to read, and etc. Society has outgrown this: gradually here and
there we have collected facts - not how someone thinks a plan might work
but how the plan actually did work when it was tried; we have studied
criminals instead of taking it for granted that we know them, we have
watched crime instead of theorizing about it and then with the material
we have tried careful experiments - experiments in housing prisoners,
experiments in punishment, experiments in work and diet; until today no
intelligent man thinks of aimlessly giving advice as to crime - he knows
that this is a subject for experts - a subject still dark, with much to
be learned, but still a realm wh^re the day of guesswork is past. In the
matter of charity, perhaps the greatest advance has been made. The
classic examples of this is the history of the English poor law. At
first England frowned fiercely.on beggery and poverty and whipped and</p>
<p>y3-/-«</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>branded and hanged the poor devils. Then she melted into sentiment and
coddled and stuffed her paupers until it seemed ae though all JSngland
would go to bagging. Finally the state bethought itself to askwho are
the pauper8, what makes pauperism, how can we decrease it and help
people to help themselves? For this reason it now uses the statistics,
studies social conditions, organizes charitable societies, avoids dupli-
cations of work, detects importers and seeks in every way to know the
causes of poverty and apply intelligent and scientific remedies. The
world is 81i11 far from solving the problem but we are much nearer than
men were in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>
<p>Thus sociological material is today used by all kinds of .social re-
forms: the organizers of childrens societies, , and of schools; those
who s®ed to help the deaf and the bling, those who want to get work
for the idl®; saving banks and building associations are established on
carefully ascertained principles, model homes built for tenants - indeed
this is the age wh°n lasting and effective reform has become systematic
and scientific and has replaced sentiment and theory.</p>
<p>The question now comes:</p>
<p>5th. What Has the First Sociological Society done?</p>
<p>I want to be perfectly frank in this matter and to say plainly that
in my opinion this society has done nothing. I know we have organized -
we have held meetings. We have had pleasant social gatherings and we
have talked. But of actual work accomplished either in the line of know-
ing just what th°re is to be done, and just how we are to do it, and what
there is to be learned as to method from the sociological work of the day,
and above all of actual accomplished work, it seems to me perfectly fair
to say that this society has done little more than nothing. Indeed I
have several times seriously asked myself whether I was justified in
attending those meetings and whether there was a reasonable prospect of
an end of aimless talking and a beginning of definite doing. We seem to
me in the first place to have no clear id^a of what the society is for;</p>
<p>/-*7</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>we seem again to have a tendency to fritter away precious time on trifles,
we seen to forget when we are discussing ways and means that all this is
not m«r*» theory but that definite information of the experience of others
in the work and of the general state of scientific knowledge on most of
these points is “asily obtainable. And finally w*»	in	the laying out</p>
<p>of our definite practical work for committee to have not the faintest
shade of an id*a of the enormous difficulties and infinite complications
of scm’’ of tha subjects w° undertake. To particularies, at the last
‘S- meeting the subject for discussion was the influence of tenement life on
small children - a subject of the deepest importance and of wide influence
There is a perfect mass of material on the subject - studies, maps and
plans, vital statistics, satieties of dwellings and occupations, mea-
surements of children’s bodies, experiments as to mental aptitude, in-
quiries into home life - indeed I could without difficulty gather right
here in Atlanta a hundred volumes of material on the point to be dis-
cussed. If a sociological society had been going to discuss that subject
what would one reasonably expect the trend of the discussion to be?</p>
<p>They would expect first that the general conditions of slums would be
wxiJlain^d: Bootha maps of London would be exhibited and studies shown of
the physical environments; the Hull House maps and papers would have been
taken n°xt; something would hav^ been said of the slums of flew York and
Philadelphia. Then the general question of children would be approach^d-
what physical surroundings are necessary and the lack of these would be
illustrated by th* death rate of children in slums; the moral demands of
child life would be touched upon and criminal statistics produced to show
how youthful criminals are bred in the slums; finally we would have the
evil social effects - lewd talk, illegimate children, prostitution, per-
sonal uncleaness, the spread of disease and the like. Those are some
very elementary matters connected with the life of children in slums which
any consideration of the subject must take up. But beside this the cen-
tral part of the discussion ought to have been the slums of Atlanta: we</p>
<p>Sfi-/-*£</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>ought to have had the map cf several typical alleys showing the size and
relation of the houses, the number of rooms, the number dwelling there,
and the number and size of children; the general characteristics of the
families, the ability of the children in school or at work, the number of.
deaths in the alley in a year, the kinds of diseases, and a general his-
tory cf the all^y. From one to five such studies might have been made.</p>
<p>Such i8 what we might reasonably expect tin the discussion of this
subject by a club which calls itself sociological. And yet I doubt if any
member of this society w^nt from that discussion with a single new fact
or id^a. Nobody had studied the subject, nobody knew anything about the
matter, noone had any information to impart. About two days before the
meeting in the midst of a busy week*s v;ork I was informed that I was ex-
pected to discuss a subject which exp-rts have been studying 10 to 20
years. And wh^n out of sheer respect for the intelligence of these
members I mildly protested that two days was not enough time for suoh a
subject - the society blandly waved its hand, and said ’’why you had three
days’’.</p>
<p>I remember last year at the Altanta Conference, the president of this
society gave an outline cf this organization and a list of its committees.</p>
<p>I must confess it made a splendid showing: but there was one fact that the
president omitted to mention and that was that very few of those committees
had done any work worth mentioning. Nor was this the fault of the presi-
dent: he had urg^d th* society again and again to do actual work and the
society did attempt to help the Atlanta Conference, but of all the bad re-
ports that carc° into that conference that of this clubs rae the worst. If
it had not b^en for the personal work of Dr. Butler and Mr. Matthews the
Atlanta Conference would have had to omit Atlanta from the cities invest-
igated. I said to myself, however, this society is young yet - next fall
the work will begin. And lo! at the first meeting I attended the club
was adopting a new constitution. I must say I was somewhat disgusted -
what do we want I thought of a New Constitution when we have done nothing</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>under the old one. A constitution is not worth the paper it is written on
unless it is backed by deeds and give the deeds and I care not whether we
have a constitution or not. One of the objects of the new constitution
was said to be the facilitating of the organizing of other sociological
clubs in other cities. I would as soon think of my baby advertising to</p>
<p>•	-	r? .</p>
<p>teach persons to walk - why he can’t walk himse)f.</p>
<p>After the new constitution was adopted the same difficulties appear-</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>7 ed as last year in the apportioning of work to committees. One afternoon
last year we casually discussed the matter of crime. In a moment the dis-
cussion sped - we swept through the calendar of crimes in 15 minutes and
attacked the subject of criminals; pausing there a moment we sailed rally
to the matter of punishment, then to slums and education, then to the con-
duct of courts, then to color discrimination, then to the situation of the
south and to the Uegro problems. A library of 10,000 volumes would not
have covered the matters we lightly discussed in that afternoon and then
as I was opening my eyes in wonder, we suddenly appointed a committee and
charged it with th« whole matter. Does anyone wonder that we haven’t
heard from that committee since? It is my candid opinion that if we had
appointed a committee of 100 persons and given several thousand dollars
to expend they could not possibly have accomplished the work we gave them</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>in less than 300 years.</p>
<p>The trouble is we despise the day of little things - we neglect little
movements, small efforts, tentative experiments, and throw ourselves</p>
<p>blindly against adamantive walls which have withstood the assaults of phil-
anthropists for centuries, we had a simple program of work laid before us;</p>
<p>vr*	y*</p>
<p>it was sugg st^d that we make a careful map of the .Negro slums of Atlanta
and see how th&lt;=»y ware situated with regard to the various agencies for
ggod. This was not theory or experiment - it was simply analogous to a
great work now being done in flew York City. Yet this society virtually
spoiled the plan by appointing an aimless committee to give pastors of var-</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>iou8 churches advice as to their mission fields in the city. The chair-
man of the committee protested at the time that this method of attacking
the matter would not do - hut not we must have the committee. And of cours
the committee never reported for it had nothing to report, several times
other promising definite proposals for small beginnings have been made
but no sooner were they launched then someone proposed something else, a-
nother pointed out that this method would not reform everybody and made
the sunshine 24 hours in the day and the whole plan became amended and</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>blocked and di°d a peacefuly death in committees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up then: we as a society are not sure what we ought to do;
and we have made clumsyand ineffectual attempts to do a mass of things
without a knowledge of the facts or of the well-grounded theory of the
subject. We add to our memoership in a haphazard way, forcing people to
join who simply come to visit; we appoint committees and distribute v/ork
in a way equally accidental and thoughtless and above all we yield to the
temptation to talk and discuss when we have nothing to say.</p>
<p>but “nough of criticism. I know it is much easier to find fault
then to avoid fault - to pick flaws in work done than to do work. And
yet candid criticism has its place - it lies at the root of all reform
and after all in this devious world perhaps the wonder is that we stray
so little rather than that we err so much.</p>
<p>Let me therefore turn to the last point I wish to consider.</p>
<p>6th. What this Society might and ought to do.</p>
<p>‘L’ne aim of a society of this kind ought to be to furnish accurate</p>
<p>information to such agencies as are engaged in th* work of social reform,</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>to endeavor to increase the cooperation between those agencies, and to seek
to establish new agencies for reform in neglected and unknown fields of
effort. Let me take up these 2 things in order:</p>
<p>First, I say, this society should aim to gather facts and information
for its own and others use. 1 was once pursuing an elaborate piece of
investigation in regard to the negroes of a certain city, when 1 came across</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>a woman whc could if she would give me much valuable matter, she looked at
me suspiciously and said,“What*s the object of this investigation?” “aimply
to get at the truth”, I answered. “Do you propose to do anything after you
get the facts”, said she. “We simply collect the facts”, I returned, “Uth-
ers may use them as they will” Then you are trying only to get facts and
60 ribt to better things’,’ she said. “Yes”, I again answered. “Hura^h”, she re-
■n plied and I’m still waiting for that information, flow this illustrates
well the attitude of many minds toward careful and systematic collection
of minute facts. *en are so filled with ideas of reform that they haven’t
time to study the abuses which they seek to abolish and baldly assume that
they know all about them. One of the most baffling things aoout the negro
problem today is^the fact that somany people in this country are abso-
lutely convinced that they thoroughly understand it. Especially is every
negro Bupoos-d to oe born with a thorough understanding of this intricate
problem in all its bearings. And yet a moment’s thought will convince
us all of our ignorance. How many of us hear really know very much of the
history and present conditon of the eight millions of our race in tnis
land? we call the “negro problem’ certain bits of personal experience,
joined to some ready and general information and to a good deal of gossip.
There is not one of us that does not need to study thououghly and minute-
ly any part of this subject which we propose to work upon. This society
should be a center for gathering such information in Atlanta, we ought
to begin to study thoroughly.comprehensively,and minutely the situation
of the Wegroes of this city - we ought to become a bureau of accurate in-
formation for all facts connected with th^ Hegro - wealth and poverty,
business and labor, crime and pauperism, charity and reform, hemes and
streets, migration, wages, occupations, marriage and divorce, illegitimacy,
education, church organizations, other organizations - ev°ry general fact
which b^ars upon the condition of the fl^gro in this city, past and present
ought to b^ carefully collected and recorded, and now and then published.</p>
<p>y3-/-8f</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>We should follow th« history of alleys, compile a careful list of the wor-
thy, study minutely the abode and history of the criminals, keep an eye
upon orphans and homeless waifs - in fact, no fact or condition should escape
the eye and pen of a society whose chief desire it is to know the social
problems they s^k to solve.</p>
<p>J?or this work w should have committees, and ev^ry member of th« or-
ganization be a member of some committee. JSach committee should work under
a chairman and the chairman could if he saw fit appoint sub-committees. At
every meeting it should be the work of -<em>ach committee to report some care-
fully ascertained facts to this committee and to report in writing not oral-
ly. The facts may be small or unimportant, they may be a study of a whole
district, th</em>»y may be historic data, illustrative incidents, but always accu-
rate, always reliable and always designed to teach us more of the actual
situation of the people and guide our feet in matters of reform.</p>
<p>Th°se committee* should be standing committees and no other committee
ought to b^ appointed during the year, save in very exceptional cases. The
committees should be appointed on such subjects as roverty. Crime, Health,
Homes, Churches, Kducation, Occupations, the defective classes, wealth,
Reading, and etc. - That is, simple comprehensive fields where much may be
learned.</p>
<p>Second, we should endeavor to increase cooperation among the various
agencies for social betterment among the Negroes of Atlanta:	these	agencies</p>
<p>are the churches, the schools, the secred and insurance societies, and the
benevolent efforts of various kinds. Our object here should be not to
meddle, not to interfere in the work of others, but by spreading informat-
ion and pointing out fields of action we shoud seek to reduce the dupli-
cation of benevolent work to a minimum and get the widest good fellowship
and cooperation possible. Mother’s meeting, lectures, circulating librar-
ies, savings associations and general reform work could in this way be spread
by sheer contagion through the various church constituencies and communities.</p>
<p>This society should stand ready</p>
<p>church in Atlanta</p>
<p>‘-70</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>two, thr^e times a ye.^r competent persons to explain to the members some ele-
mentary matter of reform - ventilation, the use of water, sewing schools, hy-
gienic cooking, reading, saving, and etc. in this way effort could be stimu-
lated in existing agencies toward b^ttorment of present conditions.</p>
<p>ior this purpose there should be an executive committee under the chair-</p>
<p>^ manship of the president which should arrange meetings and conferences, and</p>
<p>sK</p>
<p>tell us what other movements are doing and seek to build gradually a central
board which would federate all the benevolent efforts of the city among
negroes and cooperate with similar efforts among whites.</p>
<p>Thirdly the society should endeavor to find out and explore fields of re</p>
<p>reformatory effort neglected by oth^r agencies, or forgotten or unknown. And</p>
<p>should seek h®rrt to inaugurate new movements for betterment. in this work</p>
<p>however gr®at car® must be exercised. Our committees stand for ears open to</p>
<p>all sounds from ev rywhere and letting no whisper escape, nut our efforts</p>
<p>at actual reform must not be thus dispersed. we cannot reform the whole</p>
<p>world at one*, we must concentrate our efforts; one thing at a time and that</p>
<p>g</p>
<p>a small thing; careful tentative effort, feeling our way slowly, makirTno
failures and takin no backward steps and above all remembering that perma-
nent reform is slow work and that 10 years in such work is a mere bagatelle,
one thing at a time then and let that one thing take our whole strength, we
mingt for instance do this: each of us hare might contribut to the committee
onSchools a book suitable for children to read, we each might get a few
friends to give similar books. Then this modest little library of say 25
or 30 volumes properly labelled and cased might be place in one of the pub-
lic schools to circulate fr a month. Then in another school for a month,
then in another, next y-^ar we might collect another small library - in 10
years might thus place in =&gt;v®ry school house in the city a circulating
library and begin to send some to the country schools - simple work, nothing
gr^at, no wholesale manufacture of saints, nothing to wave our hands about or
yell, but Work. Keform and Advance such as in the past has built nations and</p>
<p>/w</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>and empires. Wh^n this enterprise was well started and in charge of the prop-
er committee - or possibly given over to some special organization, we could
b°gin another and larger effort - but slowly, carefully, we could start
a movement toward a penny savings bank. Hot a money making institution, but
a benevolent enterprise to encourage thrift run on business principles. We</p>
<p>i could select in the city three or four Negroes whose reputation for honesty</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>‘^’-and profity was unquestioned. If possible we would ask three or four in-
terested white men to act with them and form the directory board of a Wegro
Penny savings bank. Kach church could be induced to hold meetings and hear</p>
<p>talks on thrift and little things. The various schools - boelman, Atlanta</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>■oaptist, olark, *orris Brown and others could preach a crusade ofvaving at
chapel exercises. At several of the larger colored stores, a small s^and,
a tin box, and a padlock could be placed and a member of the committee on
saving could be placed there from 8 to 10 P.tt. on Wednesday and Saturday
night. .Bankbooks with stamped receipts could be given out. Ihe enterprise
would flourish for a while then it would die down, but we would not die
down - more lectures, more talks, tracts, and posters, a notice in the
Constitution and habits of saving would begin to grow and we would gradu-
ally know whera to place our branches - how to encourage people. In five
years we might have $200 or $300 in deposits; in 10 years $2-3000. In
15 years we might hire modest quarters, use our money for a building
association or surrender the whole work to a special society, nothing great
in such a movement - nothing to take ones breath away - it has been done a
hundred times in other cities among other people and in a few cas^s among
negroes - but this true rising - which does not necessarily call for a con-
stitution on paper but it calls for a certain mental and moral constitution
in us which is too often lacking.</p>
<p>I might easily go on naming a hundred different methods of work dis-
tributy tracts, offering prizes in the schools and churches, a comprehen-
sive system of neighborhood visiting, careful organized and persistently</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>conducted serine of mothers meetings and fireside schools, temporary care of
waifs and foundlings, shelters for friendless girls, a social settlement
house in the slums, - all these and many more - not all at once, not all
in a year, hut slowly, gradually, doggedly - such work lies before.</p>
<p>finally as to our meetings we must stop throwing away time in endless,</p>
<p>Si</p>
<p>V senseless and aimless talk. Weare here for business, juirst we want inform-</p>
<p>Ration on local conditions from th» chairman of coirmittees and chairmen have-
ing nothing to report ought to be mad^ to f<em>el thoroughly ashamed for their
neglect and carelessness, the reports should oe bri^f, definite, and contain
actual dsta. we do not want ssays on what ought to be dona but what y ur
committee actually has done and when it did it and how it did it and what
the result was. We do not want vague general statement but definite, brief,
concise records of date, place and deeds. After these reports and a short
discussion of the meaning of these facts trier, we should turn to the work
of the meeting: somebody who has studied something and knows about it and
has his knowledge in a shape to impart clearly and somewhat more briefly
than I am doing, should then take the floor and teach us something, either
in sociological theory, or in efforts of other lands or cities, or in local
conditions, we do not want general essays, or schoolboy papers - but facts
and information and carefully weighed opinion. Then we can go knowing more
than wh^n w» cam’-’ and b^tt^r prepared for work. If noone has such a paper
prepared, then l^t us take one of th</em> dozens of excellent works on social
questions and reading it, passing it from hand to hand and discussing it.
ur let us adopt a textbook and study tha subject we profess to know some-</p>
<p>If in a half-century we thus increase our knowledge of social conditions
and otart a few movements to better abuses then this club will deserve well
of the nation.</p>
<p>jellow-workrs, the Uegro problem is in this room - between these four</p>
<p>thing of</p>
<p>walls and it is the question</p>
<p>tf.5-‘-94</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Negroes can so coop rate in unselfish effort as to better in some degree
the condition of the aegroe masses. Among the masses haVft problen8 but</p>
<p>not n&gt;£ro problems - there are problems of crime, of poverty, of sexual
lewdness, of ill-health, of heredity. The Negro problem is the question
whether those who have raised themselves above this dead level of degrad-
ation can do as othar nations have done - cooperate, investigate, sacrifice,
and lift as they climb.</p>
