Colleagues, 

I am very pleased to announce that, as part of our efforts in Action Steps for Equity, the Dean’s Office has three funding opportunities to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The projects that this funding supports will help fulfill two of our strategic plan priorities: Climate and Repair.   

Faculty, staff and units across the College are eligible to apply. You may apply for more than one of the three funding sources, however, we will prioritize distributing the funds as widely as possible across the College. 

All applications are due by March 1, 2023. We expect to make at least 30 awards in total. Award decisions will be announced by mid-April.
