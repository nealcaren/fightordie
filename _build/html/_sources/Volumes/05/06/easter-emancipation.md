# Easter-Emancipation 1863-1913 (1913)

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">I am dead;
<p class = "verse">Yet somehow, somewhere,
<p class = "verse">In Time&rsquo;s weird contradiction, I 
<p class = "verse">May tell of that dread deed, wherewith
<p class = "verse">I brought to Children of the Moon 
<p class = "verse">Freedom and vast salvation.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">I was a woman born
<p class = "verse">And trod that streaming street
<p class = "verse">That ebbs and flows from Harlem&rsquo;s hills
<p class = "verse">Thro&rsquo; caves and canyons limned in light
<p class = "verse">Down to the twisting sea.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">That night of nights
<p class = "verse">I stood alone and at the End
<p class = "verse">Until the sudden highway to the Moon,
<p class = "verse">Golden in splendor,
<p class = "verse">Became too real to doubt.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Dimly I set foot upon the air;
<p class = "verse">I fled, I flew, thro&rsquo; thrills of light,
<p class = "verse">With all about, above, below the whirring
<p class = "verse">Of almighty wings. I found a twilight land
<p class = "verse">Where, hardly hid, the sun
<p class = "verse">Sent softly saddened rays of
<p class = "verse">Red and brown to burn the iron earth
<p class = "verse">And bathe the snow-white peaks
<p class = "verse">In mighty splendor.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Black were the men,
<p class = "verse">Hard haired and silent slow,
<p class = "verse">Moving as shadows
<p class = "verse">Bending with face of fear to earthward;
<p class = "verse">And women there were none.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">&ldquo;Woman, woman, woman!&rdquo;
<p class = "verse">I cried in mounting terror.
<p class = "verse">&ldquo;Woman and Child!&rdquo;
<p class = "verse">And the cry sang back
<p class = "verse">Thro&rsquo; Heaven with the
<p class = "verse">Whirring of almighty wings.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Wings, wings, endless wings,
<p class = "verse">Heaven and earth are wings;
<p class = "verse">Wings that flutter, furl and fold,
<p class = "verse">Always folding and unfolding,
<p class = "verse">Ever folding yet again;
<p class = "verse">Wings, veiling some vast
<p class = "verse">And veiled face,
<p class = "verse">In blazing blackness,
<p class = "verse">Behind the folding and unfolding,
<p class = "verse">The rolling and unrolling of
<p class = "verse">Almighty wings!
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">I saw the black men huddle
<p class = "verse">Fumed in fear, falling face downward;
<p class = "verse">Vainly I clutched and clawed,
<p class = "verse">Dumbly they cringed and cowered,
<p class = "verse">Moaning in mournful monotone:
<p class = "verse indent">O Freedom, O Freedom,
<p class = "verse indent">O Freedom over me;
<p class = "verse indent">Before I&rsquo;ll be a slave
<p class = "verse indent">I&rsquo;ll be buried in my grave
<p class = "verse indent">And go home to my God
<p class = "verse indent">And be free.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">It was as angel music
<p class = "verse">From the dead,
<p class = "verse">And ever, as they sang,
<p class = "verse">The winged Thing of wings, filling all Heaven,
<p class = "verse">Folding and unfolding, and folding yet again,
<p class = "verse">Tore out their blood and entrails
<p class = "verse">&rsquo;Til I screamed in utter terror
<p class = "verse">And a silence came:
<p class = "verse">A silence and the wailing of a babe
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Then at last I saw and shamed;
<p class = "verse">I knew how these dumb dark and dusky things
<p class = "verse">Had given blood and life
<p class = "verse">To fend the caves of underground
<p class = "verse">The great black caves of utter night
<p class = "verse">Where earth lay full of mothers
<p class = "verse">And their babes.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Little children sobbing in darkness.
<p class = "verse">Little children crying in silent pain.
<p class = "verse">Little mothers rocking and groping and struggling,
<p class = "verse">Digging and delving and groveling
<p class = "verse">Amid the dying-dead and dead-in-life.
<p class = "verse">And drip and dripping of warm, wet blood
<p class = "verse">Far, far beneath the wings.
<p class = "verse">The folding and unfolding of almighty wings.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">I bent with tears and pitying hands
<p class = "verse">Above these dusky star-eyed children.
<p class = "verse">Crinkly haired, with sweet-sad baby voices
<p class = "verse">Pleading low for light and love and living&mdash; And I crooned
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse indent">Little children weeping there,
<p class = "verse indent">God shall find thy faces fair;
<p class = "verse indent">Guerdon for thy deep distress.
<p class = "verse indent">He shall send His tenderness;
<p class = "verse indent">For the tripping of thy feet
<p class = "verse indent">Make a mystic music sweet
<p class = "verse indent">In the darkness of thy hair;
<p class = "verse indent">Light and laughter in the air&mdash;
<p class = "verse indent">Little children weeping there.
<p class = "verse indent">God shall find thy faces fair!
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">I strode above the stricken bleeding men.
<p class = "verse">The rampart &rsquo;ranged against the skies.
<p class = "verse">And shouted:
<p class = "verse">&ldquo;Up I say, build and slay;
<p class = "verse">Fight face foremost, force a way,
<p class = "verse">Unloose, unfetter and unbind;
<p class = "verse">Be men and free.&rdquo;
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Dumbly they shrank
<p class = "verse">Muttering they pointed toward that peak
<p class = "verse">Than vastness vaster,
<p class = "verse">Whereon a darkness brooded,
<p class = "verse">&ldquo;Who shall look and live,&rdquo; they sighed;
<p class = "verse">And I sensed
<p class = "verse">The folding and unfolding of almighty wings
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Yet did we build of iron, bricks and blood;
<p class = "verse">We built a day, a year, a thousand years.
<p class = "verse">Blood was the mortar,blood and tears
<p class = "verse">And, ah, the Thing, the Thing of wings,
<p class = "verse">The winged folding wing of Things,
<p class = "verse">Did furnish much mad mortar
<p class = "verse">For that tower.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Slow and ever slower rose the towering task
<p class = "verse">And with it rose the sun.
<p class = "verse">Until at last on one wild day,
<p class = "verse">Wind-whirled, cloud-swept and terrible.
<p class = "verse">I stood beneath the burning shadow
<p class = "verse">Of the peak.
<p class = "verse">Beneath the whirring of almighty wings
<p class = "verse">While downward from my feet
<p class = "verse">Streamed the long line of dusky faces
<p class = "verse">And the wail of little children sobbing under
<p class = "verse">Earth.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">&ldquo;Freedom!&rdquo; I cried.
<p class = "verse">&ldquo;Freedom!&rdquo; cried Heaven, Earth and Stars,
<p class = "verse">And a Voice near-far
<p class = "verse">Amid the folding and unfolding of Almighty wings
<p class = "verse">Answered "I am Freedom&mdash;
<p class = "verse">Who sees my face is free&mdash;
<p class = "verse">He and his."
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">I dared not look;
<p class = "verse">Downward I glanced on deep bowed heads and closed eyes,
<p class = "verse">Outward I gazed on flecked and flaming blue&mdash;
<p class = "verse">But ever onward, upward flew
<p class = "verse">The sobbing of small voices;
<p class = "verse">Down, down, far down into the night.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Slowly I lifted livid limbs aloft;
<p class = "verse">Upward I strove:
<p class = "verse">The Face, the Face;
<p class = "verse">Onward I reeled:
<p class = "verse">The Face, the Face!
<p class = "verse">To Beauty wonderful as sudden death
<p class = "verse">Or horror horrible as endless life&mdash;
<p class = "verse">Up! Up! the blood-built way
<p class = "verse">(Shadow grow vaster!
<p class = "verse">Terror come faster!)
<p class = "verse">Up! Up to the blazing blackness
<p class = "verse">Of one veiled face
<p class = "verse">And endless folding and unfolding,
<p class = "verse">Rolling and unrolling of Almighty wings:
<p class = "verse">The last step stood!
<p class = "verse">The last dim cry of pain
<p class = "verse">Fluttered across the stars&mdash;
<p class = "verse">And then&mdash;
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">Wings, wings, triumphant wings,
<p class = "verse">Lifting and lowering, waxing and waning,
<p class = "verse">Swinging and swaying, twirling and whirling,
<p class = "verse">Whispering and screaming, streaming and gleaming,
<p class = "verse">Spreading and sweeping and shading and flaming&mdash;
<p class = "verse">Wings, wings, eternal wings,
<p class = "verse">&rsquo;Til the hot red blood Flood fleeing flood,
<p class = "verse">Thundered thro&rsquo; Heaven and mine ears
<p class = "verse">While all across a purple sky
<p class = "verse">The last vast pinion
<p class = "verse">Trembled to unfold.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">I rose upon the Mountain of the Moon;
<p class = "verse">I felt the blazing glory of the Sun.
<p class = "verse">I heard the Song of Children crying "Free!"
<p class = "verse">I saw the Face of Freedom&mdash;
<p class = "verse">And I died.
</div>
