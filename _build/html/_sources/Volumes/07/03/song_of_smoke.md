# The Song of the Smoke (1914)

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">I am the smoke king,</p>
<p class = "verse">I am black.</p>
<p class = "verse indent">I am swinging in the sky,</p>
<p class = "verse indent">I am ringing worlds on high;</p>
<p class = "verse indent">I am the thought of the throbbing mills,</p>
<p class = "verse indent">I am the soul of the Soul toil kills,</p>
<p class = "verse indent">I am the ripple of trading rills.</p>
<p class = "verse">Up I'm curling from the sod,</p>
<p class = "verse">I am whirling home to God.</p>
<p class = "verse">I am the smoke king,</p>
<p class = "verse">I am black.
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">I am the smoke king,
<p class = "verse">I am black.
<p class = "verse indent">I am wreathing broken hearts,
<p class = "verse indent">I am sheathing devils' darts;
<p class = "verse indent">Dark inspiration of iron times,
<p class = "verse indent">Wedding the toil of toiling climes,
<p class = "verse indent">Shedding the blood of bloodless crimes,
<p class = "verse">Down I lower in the blue,
<p class = "verse">Up I tower toward the true.
<p class = "verse">I am the smoke king,
<p class = "verse">I am black.

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">I am the smoke king,
<p class = "verse">I am black.
<p class = "verse indent">I am darkening with song,
<p class = "verse indent">I am hearkening to wrong;
<p class = "verse indent">I will be black as blackness can,
<p class = "verse indent">The blacker the mantle the mightier the man,
<p class = "verse indent">My purpl'ing midnights no day dawn may ban. 
<p class = "verse">I am carving God in night,
<p class = "verse">I am painting Hell in white.
<p class = "verse">I am the smoke king,
<p class = "verse">I am black.

<div class="poem">
<p class = "verse">I am the smoke king,
<p class = "verse">I am black.
<p class = "verse indent">I am cursing ruddy morn,
<p class = "verse indent">I am hearsing hearts unborn;
<p class = "verse indent">Souls unto me are as mists in the night,
<p class = "verse indent">I whiten my black men, I blacken my white, 
<p class = "verse indent">What's the hue of a hide to a man in his might!
<p class = "verse">Hail, then, gritty, grimy hands,
<p class = "verse">Sweet Christ, pity toiling lands!
<p class = "verse">Hail to the smoke king,
<p class = "verse">Hail to the black!
