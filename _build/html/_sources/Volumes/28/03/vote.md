# Vote (1924)

Keep your eye steady, Mr. Black Voter, your powder dry. You don't really care a rap who is president. Republican presidents are just about as bad as Democratic and Democratic presidents are little better than nothing. But watch your Congressmen. Never mind the dust and yelling and large talk. Watch the candidates for Congress and the state legislature. Know their names and their records. Get a list of those traitors who voted against Henry Lincoln Johnson in the contest for Georgia. Nearly all of them are candidates for office. Knife them at the polls! Defeat your enemies even if they are Republicans. Vote for your friends even if they are Democrats. Play the political game with knowledge and brains. Watch your Congressmen!
