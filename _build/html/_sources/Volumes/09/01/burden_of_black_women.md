# The Burden of Black Women (1914)

<p class = "poem">Dark daughter of the lotus leaves that watch the Southern sea,</p>
<p class = "poem">Wan spirit of a prisoned soul a-panting to be free;</p>
<p class = "poem-indent">The muttered music of thy streams, the whispers of the deep</p>
<p class = "poem-indent"> Have kissed each other in God's name and kissed a world to sleep.</p>
<p>
<p class = "poem">The will of the world is a whistling wind sweeping a cloud-cast sky,
<p class = "poem">And not from the east and not from the west knelled its soul-searing cry;
<p class = "poem">But out of the past of the Past's grey past, it yelled from the top of the sky;
<p class = "poem-indent">Crying: Awake, O ancient race! Wailing: O woman arise!
<p class = "poem-indent">And crying and sighing and crying again as a voice in the midnight cries;
<p class = "poem-indent">But the burden of white men bore her back, and the white world stifled her sighs.
<p>
<p class = "poem ">The White World's vermin and filth:
<p class = "poem-indent">All the dirt of London,
<p class = "poem-indent">All the scum of New York;
<p class = "poem-indent">Valiant spoilers of women
<p class = "poem-indent">And conquerors of unarmed men;
<p class = "poem-indent">Shameless breeders of bastards
<p class = "poem-indent">Drunk with the greed of gold,
<p class = "poem-indent">Baiting their blood-stained hooks
<p class = "poem-indent">With cant for the souls of the simple,
<p class = "poem-indent">Bearing the White Man's Burden
<p class = "poem-indent">Of Liquor and Lust and Lies!
<p class = "poem-indent">Unthankful we wince in the East,
<p class = "poem-indent">Unthankful we wail from the westward,
<p class = "poem-indent">Unthankfully thankful we sing,
<p class = "poem-indent">In the un-won wastes of the wild:
<p class = "poem-big-indent">I hate them, Oh!
<p class = "poem-big-indent">I hate them well,
<p class = "poem-big-indent">I hate them, Christ!
<p class = "poem-big-indent">As I hate Hell,
<p class = "poem-big-indent">If I were God
<p class = "poem-big-indent">I'd sound their knell
<p class = "poem-big-indent">This day!
<p>
<p class = "poem-indent">Who raised the fools to their glory
<p class = "poem-indent">But black men of Egypt and Ind?
<p class = "poem-indent">Ethiopia's sons of the evening,
<p class = "poem-indent">Chaldeans and Yellow Chinese?
<p class = "poem-indent">The Hebrew children of Morning
<p class = "poem-indent">And mongrels of Rome and Greece?
<p class = "poem-big-indent">Ah, well!
<p>

<p class = "poem">And they that raised the boasters
<p class = "poem">Shall drag them down again:
<p class = "poem">Down with the theft of their thieving
<p class = "poem">And murder and mocking of men,
<p class = "poem">Down with their barter of women
<p class = "poem">And laying and lying of creeds,
<p class = "poem">Down with their cheating of childhood,
<p class = "poem">And drunken orgies of war—
<p class = "poem-big-indent">down,
<p class = "poem-bigger-indent">down,
<p class = "poem-biggest-indent">deep down,
<p>
<p class = "poem">Till the Devil's strength be shorn,
<p class = "poem">Till some dim, darker David a-hoeing of his corn,
<p class = "poem">And married maiden, Mother of God,
<p class = "poem">Bid the Black Christ be born!
<p>
<p class = "poem">Then shall the burden of manhood,
<p class = "poem">Be it yellow or black or white,
<p class = "poem">And Poverty, Justice and Sorrow—
<p class = "poem">The Humble and Simple and Strong,
<p class = "poem">Shall sing with the Sons of Morning
<p class = "poem">And Daughters of Evensong:
<p>
<p class = "poem">Black mother of the iron hills that guard the blazing sea,
<p class = "poem">Wild spirit of a storm-swept soul a-struggling to be free,
<p class = "poem">Where 'neath the bloody finger marks, thy riven bosom quakes,
<p class = "poem">Thicken the thunders of God's voice, and lo! a world awakes!
