# Remember (1920)

The foundations of the present political South are built upon sand.
It requires only a resolute executive in the White House and a free
House of Representatives; then when the Representatives from the
Southern South knock at the door, the House of Representatives has
simply to say---Who votes in Mississippi, in South Carolina, in
Alabama?---and to declare that upon such a basis of franchise, the
so-called members of Congress have not been legally elected.

This is all. The deed is done. And the Negro is a free man.

Nor is the possibility of this so far away. A little more southern
arrogance in Washington, a little more greed in the expenditure of
public funds, such as occurred during the war; a little larger
assumption that the South owns the United States, and the nation may
awake to real Democracy.

Or, again,---suppose the "dirty foreigners" and the disfranchised
Socialists and the disfranchised blacks should get together and vote
together at the next election!
