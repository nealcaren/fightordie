A chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy gave a medal to Colin W. Covington, a University of South Carolina student, for his essay, "The Freedman's Bureau" in 1911. As detailed in The Crisis, Covington plagiarized his submission from an essay of the same name written by Du Bois for the Atlantic Monthly. Du Bois published portions of each side-by-side in the April 1912 issue, concluding that a less modest person would want "that medal clipped from the proud young Southern breast that bears it and pinned on his own."
