This book is an ongoing project to make available a selection of works by W.E.B. Du Bois that appeared in The Crisis, the official journal of the NAACP. Du Bois founded the journal in 1910 and regularly contributed editorials and occasional articles between 1910 and 1934 when he left the NAACP.

In addition to his many other commitments during this period, his writing for The Crisis was prolific, frequently writing multiple items for each of the 286 issues he edited.

The content of his pieces varied widely, from short items recognizing developments at Black colleges or Y.W.C.A chapters, fiery denunciations of Southern Jim Crow laws, to long essays on the relationship between capitalism and racism.  

Although he published his own articles every year or so, Du Bois's main contribution to the writing of The Crisis was his editorials. Early editorials in The Crisis are unsigned, although historians and biographers attribute most to Du Bois, except those appearing under the name of another NAACP official or when it was noted in the pages that Du Bois was traveling during the production of the issues. These usually appeared near the back, after an "Opinion" section composed of extracts from Black newspapers. In 1921, the Crisis switched from publishing "Editorials" to an "Opinion" column credit to Du Bois, and it was usually the first section in each issue. Finally, in the late 1920s, his section was renamed "Postscript" and moved to the back pages.

This volume attempts to represent the full diversity of Du Bois's writing during this timer period, emphasizing those pieces that engage in analysis. The only substantive area largely absent is his editorials criticizing Booker Washington and his educational strategies, as these arguments are covered well elsewhere.

The title of this volume, *Dare Your Fight*, comes from a 1914 [editorial *Join or Die*](Volumes/07/03/fightordie.md). The emotional plea for support The Crisis

>Merciful God! does a drowning man ask the USE of struggles? No, he struggles, he fights. He wins the shore or dies fighting.
>&#8239;
>Black men of America, are you men? Dare you fight?

The entire run of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span> is available at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/pub_crisis). I reviewed each issue to identify relevant pieces, copied the text using the OCRed version provided with each issue, and then cleaned and edited the text to match the version found in the PDF. Each cleaned article is saved in markdown format and is available on the project's [GitHub site](http://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/).

The versions of his work published here largely reflect how they appeared when original published. For example, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span>  was always in small caps. Only a few consistent changes have been made:
* Paragraph long quotes are indented unlike in the Crisis. The quotation marks remain, however.
* While early articles began with a drop cap and the first few words were capitalized in many pieces, those have not been reproduced here.
* The n-word has been replace with n*****.

Finally, while this project emphasizes the writing of W.E.B. Du Bois, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span> was much bigger than that. There's politics, community updates, lists of college graduates, poetry, fiction, and art. Where else will you stumble across Langston Hughes coming in second in reader-submitted poetry contest? Every author's name provides an opportunity to go down a rabbit hole exploring a new facet of early twentieth century Black culture. But, Du Bois, who always had an eye towards the bottom line, must have realized that what his readers wanted most was baby pictures. Adorable grins appear in just about every issue. There is likely no larger archive of African American infant portraiture than the pages of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span>.
