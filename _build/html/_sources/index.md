# Dare You Fight: W.E.B. Du Bois in The Crisis


This project is an ongoing effort to make available the writings by W.E.B. Du Bois that appeared in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span>, the official journal of the NAACP. Du Bois founded the magazine in 1910 and regularly contributed editorials and articles until 1934.

**Work in progress.** This site currently includes 285 articles, but hundreds more are in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span> archives. If you want to help make more of Du Boiss's work available, look at our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/blob/main/contributing.md), or email [me](mailto:nealcaren@unc.edu).

```{epigraph}
As *Dare You Fight* grows, it should prove to be an indispensable resource for researchers and instructors interested in Du Bois, Black literature, Black politics, and the early history of this remarkable magazine.
