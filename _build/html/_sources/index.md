# Dare You Fight: W.E.B. Du Bois in The Crisis



**Edited by Neal Caren**

This project is an ongoing effort to make available a selection of  writings by W.E.B. Du Bois that appeared in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span>, the official journal of the NAACP. Du Bois founded the magazine in 1910 and regularly contributed editorials and occasional articles until 1934, when he left the NAACP.


**Work in progress.**


This archives currently includes 173 articles, but there are hundreds more in the Crisis archives. If you would like to help make more articles available, take a look at our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/blob/main/contributing.md), or email [me](mailto:nealcaren@unc.edu).
