&nbsp;    

W.E.B. Du Bois founded <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span>, the official journal of the NAACP, in 1910 and regularly contributed editorials and articles until 1934. This project is an ongoing effort to make available his writings from this period.

```{epigraph}
As *Dare You Fight* grows, it should prove to be an indispensable resource for researchers and instructors interested in Du Bois, Black literature, Black politics, and the early history of this remarkable magazine.
