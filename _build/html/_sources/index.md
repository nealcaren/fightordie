# Dare You Fight: W.E.B. Du Bois in The Crisis



**Edited by Neal Caren**

This project is an ongoing effort to make available a selection of  writings by W.E.B. Du Bois that appeared in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span>, the official journal of the NAACP. Du Bois founded the magazine in 1910 and regularly contributed editorials and occasional articles until 1934, when he left the NAACP.


**Work in progress.**
