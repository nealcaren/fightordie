# Dare You Fight

This project is an ongoing effort to make available a selection of writings by W.E.B. Du Bois that appeared in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span>, the official journal of the NAACP. Du Bois founded the magazine in 1910 and regularly contributed editorials and occasional articles until 1934 when he left the NAACP. The project's website is available at [dareyoufight.org](http://www.dareyoufight.org).
