Du Bois that appeared in <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">The Crisis</span>, the official journal of the NAACP. Du Bois founded the magazine in 1910 and regularly contributed editorials and articles until 1934.\n\n\n![](/Images/crisis_office.jpeg)  \n*W. E. B. Dubois and staff in the Crisis magazine office.

If you want to help make more of Du Boiss's work available, look at our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/blob/main/contributing.md), or email [me](mailto:nealcaren@unc.edu).\n\n\n\n```{epigraph}\nAs *Dare You Fight* grows, it should prove to be an indispensable resource for researchers and instructors interested in Du Bois, Black literature, Black politics, and the early history of this remarkable magazine.\n\n\n-- Freeden Blume Oeur, Associate Professor of Sociology and Education, Tufts University\n```\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n```{tableofcontents}\n```\n\n",
