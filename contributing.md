# Contributing

We welcome assistance with all aspects of the project, including extracting and editing article texts from PDFs and contributions of explanatory notes.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone's participation in it is governed by the project's [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [neal.caren@unc.edu](mailto:neal.caren@unc.edu).

## Errors
If you spot any potential error in the text, double check with the [original issue](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/116HKri7avjuFeg7kJgZ0X99P9KS5ZIP0?usp=sharing). You can help fix the error by [reporting it to us as an issue](https://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/issues) here, or sending me an [email](mailto:neal.caren@unc.edu).

## Help transcribing
We need help transcribing Du Bois's articles from PDF to text so they can displayed on the website. We have been less than systematic about reviewing Crisis and transcribing articles, but we have a [list of articles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P0vQs2tMEBEt0UI2fVt65cHIOo8bYYARmF31GqswGac/edit?usp=sharing) that we have done, and a few more that we have identified as good candidates. If you want to help:

1. Find a Crisis article that looks interesting, either from our "to do" [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P0vQs2tMEBEt0UI2fVt65cHIOo8bYYARmF31GqswGac/edit?usp=sharing) or from your own perusing of the [archives](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/116HKri7avjuFeg7kJgZ0X99P9KS5ZIP0?usp=sharing).
2. Make sure we haven't already done the article by searching either or the [Table of Contents](http://www.dareyoufight.org) or the specific volume on [Github](https://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/tree/main/Volumes).
3. Confirm that Du Bois is the author of the piece. Unsigned works in the Crisis usually attributed to Du Bois are those in the pre-1921 editorials in the back of the volume (not those label "Opinion", which are from other African Amerian newspapers). Starting in 1921, the Crisis switched from publishing "Editorials" to an "Opinion" column credit to Du Bois, and it was usually the first section in each issue. Finally, in the late 1920s, his section was renamed "Postscript" and moved to the back pages. If you aren't sure, you can look it up the Aptheker guide or [post the question as an issue](https://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/issues) here, or sending me an [email](mailto:neal.caren@unc.edu).
4. Copy the article text from the text version of the issue. Each PDF issue has an associated plain text file, which were generated by the Internet Archived and then partially cleaned by me. The plain text versions of the issues, however, are not crisply divided by article and can sometimes be messy, depending on the layout of the page and quality of the scan.
5. Carefully review and edit the text version to ensure that it matches the text of the original PDF.
6. Format the article using our Markdown template, saving it in a text editor (not Word or Google Docs) as a plaintext file with an .md extension.
7. Submit the article for inclusion by starting on "New Issue" on our GitHub [issues page](https://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/issues). Note that "issue" here is, "I have an *issue* to discuss," not "Our journal has a new *issue*.". In the text of the issue, put the title, year, volume, issue, and page, along with a proposed section for the article to be posted in (existing or new), along with any notes or questions. Attach the markdown file to your post. We will review and respond, and, fingers crossed, it will soon be on the website.
8. Folks who contribute article transcriptions will be listed on the credits page.

## Markdown
Each page of Dare Your Fight is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and compiled into a website using [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html).

Each Du Bois article is saved as its own plain text file, such as [kenya.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nealcaren/fightordie/main/Volumes/27/04/kenya.md):

which appears on [the site](http://www.dareyoufight.org/Volumes/27/04/kenya.html as:

	![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i4ndddvdo1le6jx/samplehtml.png?dl=1)

General markdown Markdown formatting guidelines include:
*  \*italics\*  if you want *italics*  
*  \*\*bold\*\*  if you want **bold**
* \> to begin an indented paragraph
* \# for top-level header, such as the page title and \#\# for a subheader.
* You can create a new paragraph with either a blank line or several trailing spaces at the end of a line.
You can find more [complete guides online](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

Specific Dare You Fight style is:
* Each file begins with a header symbol (\#) followed by the article title and the year in parenthesis, such as a `# Kenya (1924)`
* The second to last line is a line, accomplished with `_____`
* The last line is the citation, such as `*Citation:* Du Bois, W.E.B. 1924. "Kenya" *The Crisis*. 27(4): 152-153.`
* The title of the journal where it occurs in an article is in small caps, which can be accomplished with `<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Crisis</span>`
* Long quotes are indented using \>. For  quotes that run more than one paragraph, use a non-printing space between each paragraph to preserve the indent. Additionally, each paragraph, except the last, should end with two spaces:
```
    > Paragraph 1  
    > &nbsp;  
    > Paragraph 2
```


## Marginal notes
We seek to add marginal explanatory notes. These are usually a sentence or two that provide additional information about the subject that would likely be known to a Crisis reader at the time, such as details about a specific person or organizations. These notes can include links and pictures. To submit one, a "New Issue" on our GitHub [issues page](https://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/issues) with the page, where on the page the note should go, and text of the note in Markdown, ending with your initials (e..g, "- npc").  Folks who contribute marginal notes will be listed on the credits page.

## Inspiration
[Ben Welsh's](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/) [cummings.ee](https://cummings.ee/) gave me the idea to make this a participatory project.
