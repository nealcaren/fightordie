## Help transcribing
We need help transcribing Du Bois's articles from PDF to text so they can displayed on the website. We have been less than systematic about reviewing Crisis and transcribing articles, but we have a [list of articles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P0vQs2tMEBEt0UI2fVt65cHIOo8bYYARmF31GqswGac/edit?usp=sharing) that we have done, and a few more that we have identified as good candidates. If you want to help:

1. Find a Crisis article that looks interesting, either from our "to do" [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P0vQs2tMEBEt0UI2fVt65cHIOo8bYYARmF31GqswGac/edit?usp=sharing) or from your own perusing of the [archives](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/116HKri7avjuFeg7kJgZ0X99P9KS5ZIP0?usp=sharing).
2. Make sure we haven't already done the article by searching either or the [Table of Contents](http://www.dareyoufight.org) or the specific volume on [Github](https://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/tree/main/Volumes).
3. Confirm that Du Bois is the author of the piece. Unsigned works in the Crisis usually attributed to Du Bois are those in the pre-1921 editorials in the back of the volume (not those label "Opinion", which are from other African Amerian newspapers). Starting in 1921, the Crisis switched from publishing "Editorials" to an "Opinion" column credit to Du Bois, and it was usually the first section in each issue. Finally, in the late 1920s, his section was renamed "Postscript" and moved to the back pages. If you aren't sure, you can look it up the Aptheker guide or [post the question as an issue](https://github.com/nealcaren/fightordie/issues) here, or sending me an [email](mailto:neal.caren@unc.edu).
4. Copy the article text from the text version of the issue. Each PDF issue has an associated plain text file, which were generated by the Internet Archived and then partially cleaned by me. The plain text versions of the issues, however, are not crisply divided by article and can sometimes be messy, depending on the layout of the page and quality of the scan.

[Ben Welsh's](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/) [cummings.ee](https://cummings.ee/) gave me the idea to make this a participatory project.
